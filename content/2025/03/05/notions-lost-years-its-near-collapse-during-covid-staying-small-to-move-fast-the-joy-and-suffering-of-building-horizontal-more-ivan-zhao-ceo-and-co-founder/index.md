The way you described the early years of Notion, you described the first three to four years as the lost years.  

在描述 Notion 的早期阶段时，您将最初的三到四年描述为失去的岁月。

We try many different versions. The first version, okay, everybody can make and create their software, so let's just build a developer tool that's so easy that more people can do that. We tried that a couple of years and learned that actually most people just don't care.  

我们尝试了许多不同的版本。第一个版本，好吧，每个人都可以制作和创建自己的软件，所以我们只需构建一个非常简单的开发工具，以便更多人可以做到这一点。我们尝试了几年，发现大多数人实际上并不关心。

Our realization is actually let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software in the form factor that people do care. So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. It took us two years to realize we need to build a productivity tool. We called it sugar-coated broccoli.  

我们的认识实际上是让我们隐藏我们的愿景，即每个人都可以以人们关心的形式创建自己的软件。那么人们每天使用什么样的工具呢？生产力软件。我们花了两年时间才意识到我们需要构建一个生产力工具。我们称之为糖衣西兰花。

People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so it gave them the sugar then hide your broccoli inside of it.  

人们不想吃西兰花，但喜欢糖，所以它给人们糖，然后把西兰花藏在里面。

What other elements do you think are key to you finding something that actually ended up working?  

您认为还有哪些因素对于找到真正有效的方法至关重要？

What is the building a product or business. You want user. You want revenue. That's the product business. And building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. There are different energy. You need to create a balance. Too much of yourself. Then there's no users.  

打造产品或业务意味着什么。你想要用户。你想要收入。这就是产品业务。打造你希望世界拥有的东西就是打造你的价值。你有品味。你有一些审美。有不同的能量。你需要创造一种平衡。太过自我。那么就没有用户了。

Then you're just doing our project. And too much for business, you're building a commodity.  

那你就只是在做我们的项目。这对企业来说太过分了，你正在打造一种商品。

The way you think about Notion, it's almost like a philosophy of how to work and be versus just a productivity tool. And so I'm just curious how you think about the relationship between tools and human potential.  

您对 Notion 的看法是，它几乎就像是一种关于如何工作和生存的哲学，而不仅仅是一种生产力工具。所以我很好奇您如何看待工具和人类潜力之间的关系。

Tools are extensions of us. And once they extend us, once we shape them, once we bring them to world, they can come back to shape us.  

工具是我们的延伸。一旦工具延伸了我们，一旦我们塑造了工具，一旦我们将它们带到这个世界，它们就会反过来塑造我们。

Today, my guest is Ivan Zhao. Ivan is the co-founder and CEO of Notion. Ivan is a really unique and also a deeply philosophical founder who doesn't do a lot of podcasts, so I'm really excited to share a glimpse into how he built one of the most beloved and most popular products in the world.  

今天，我的嘉宾是 Ivan Zhao。Ivan 是 Notion 的联合创始人兼首席执行官。Ivan 是一位非常独特且具有深厚哲学思想的创始人，他很少做播客，所以我很高兴与大家分享他如何打造世界上最受欢迎和最受欢迎的产品之一。

We talk about the first three to four years of Notion that he describes as the lost years, how he was able to get into a great school in China by winning a programming contest, the joy and suffering of building a successful horizontal product, plus his approach to staying lean and craft and making trade-offs and also leadership.  

我们谈到了 Notion 成立后的最初三到四年，他把那段时间描述为失去的岁月，他如何通过赢得编程竞赛进入中国的一所好学校，打造一款成功的横向产品的喜悦和痛苦，以及他保持精益求精、做出权衡和领导的方法。

Also, a wild story about how Notion almost died during COVID because the one database that everything lived in almost ran out of space. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.  

此外，还有一个疯狂的故事，关于 Notion 在 COVID 期间几乎死亡，因为所有东西所在的一个数据库几乎用完了空间。如果你喜欢这个播客，别忘了在你最喜欢的播客应用或 YouTube 上订阅和关注它。

Thank you for having me.  

谢谢你的邀请。

I know you don't do a lot of podcasts, and so I'm very honored that you're here. I want to start with the story of Ivan. Your background is quite unique for a founder of a $10 billion plus tech company, and I don't think a lot of people know it.  

我知道您很少做播客，所以很荣幸您能来。我想先从伊万的故事开始。作为一家市值超过 100 亿美元的科技公司的创始人，您的背景非常独特，我想很多人都不知道。

For example, you grew up in a small town in China. And the way you got out of there, the way you got into tech is pretty interesting. Can you just walk us through that early years of Ivan and how you got out there?  

例如，你在中国的一个小镇长大。你离开那里、进入科技行业的方式非常有趣。你能给我们讲讲 Ivan 的早年经历以及你是如何进入科技行业的吗？

Yeah. I think a small town in China, the definition, it's actually 4 million people. It is called Urumqi. It's in the northwest desert part of China. So I grew up there and then I moved into... My mom took me to Beijing, the capital of China.  

是的。我认为中国的一个小镇，确切地说，人口实际上有 400 万。它叫乌鲁木齐。它位于中国西北部的沙漠地区。所以我在那里长大，然后搬到了……我妈妈带我去了中国首都北京。

And that's actually how I got into programming, coding, because I'm from somewhere else and in order to go into good school in the capital, you need to win some kind of competition. And there's different paths. You can get at math or you can get at programming like Information Olympiad.  

这就是我开始编程、编码的原因，因为我来自其他地方，为了进入首都的好学校，你需要赢得某种比赛。而且有不同的路径。你可以学习数学，也可以学习编程，比如信息奥林匹克竞赛。

I was really into computer games at the time so of course I picked the programming one so I can play computers all day long. And I win some competition and got me to a good school. So that's how I got into programming. Later then, I moved to Canada.  

我当时非常喜欢电脑游戏，所以我当然选择了编程专业，这样我就可以整天玩电脑了。我赢得了一些比赛，并考上了一所好学校。这就是我进入编程行业的原因。后来，我搬到了加拿大。

When I moved to Canada, got into college, did not study computer science since I already knew how to code, but a lot of video games. Did a lot of art actually, art and science. By the time I graduated college, I realized most of my friends are artists. They need to make their websites, get web portfolio made.  

当我搬到加拿大，上了大学，没有学习计算机科学，因为我已经知道如何编码了，但学了很多电子游戏。实际上我做了很多艺术，艺术和科学。到我大学毕业时，我意识到我的大多数朋友都是艺术家。他们需要制作自己的网站，制作网络作品集。

And I'm the only nerd in my art friend circle so I made three or four websites and realized, "Oh, actually people don't know how to create with the software media, computing media."  

而且我是我的艺术朋友圈中唯一的书呆子，因此我创建了三四个网站，然后意识到“哦，实际上人们不知道如何使用软件媒体、计算媒体进行创作。”

So that got me into want to create a product like Notion today which it allow more people to create tools, create software for their daily work and life.  

所以今天我想创建一个像 Notion 这样的产品，它可以让更多的人为他们的日常工作和生活创建工具、创建软件。

Okay. So going back to get into a great school and to leave the small town, not so small, you had to enter a programming contest. And you placed first or second or how well did you actually do in this one?  

好的。所以为了进入一所好学校并离开小镇，你必须参加编程比赛。你在比赛中获得了第一名或第二名，或者你实际上表现如何？

In Beijing, okay.  在北京，好的。

Pretty big. Beijing is a big city.  

相当大。北京是一个大城市。

Okay. Incredible. Another stat or a story I heard is that you learned English by watching SpongeBob SquarePants. Is that real?  

好吧。太不可思议了。我听到的另一个数据或故事是，你通过看《海绵宝宝》来学习英语。这是真的吗？

Yeah, it's real. I moved to Canada pretty late, 16 years old, and what I learned is in China you can learn English but it's typically just grammar and doing exams. What you're missing is the context, the culture. So you have to watch SpongeBob or Simpsons to get a sense of humor essentially. You can understand jokes.  

是的，这是真的。我很晚才搬到加拿大，16 岁，我学到的是，在中国你可以学英语，但通常只是语法和考试。你缺少的是背景和文化。所以你必须看《海绵宝宝》或《辛普森一家》才能从本质上感受到幽默感。你可以理解笑话。

Watching cartoons, it's probably the easiest way to do that.  

看动画片，这可能是最简单的方法。

That's amazing. And there's another seminal moment in your path. I don't know if it was this point or later, but the Douglas Engelbart paper ended up being a very meaningful moment for you.  

这真是太棒了。你的人生路上还有另一个重要的时刻。我不知道是此时还是之后，但道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特的论文最终成为你人生中意义非凡的时刻。

So while I was in Canada in last year of school working on trying to building website from our friends and building a creative tool for them, and then you just look into the history of a creative tool for software, for computing. Eventually arrived at 1960 and '70s.  

所以，去年我在加拿大读书的时候，尝试着从我们的朋友那里建立网站，并为他们开发一个创意工具，然后你就可以看看软件、计算创意工具的历史。最终到了 1960 年代和 70 年代。

So you realize the first generation of computing pioneers, which is around San Francisco, Stanford areas, South Bay, they actually had the best ideas. For them, people like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, those first generation pioneers, for them computing, there shouldn't be a separation between builders and users. It's the same medium.  

所以你知道，第一代计算机先驱，即旧金山、斯坦福地区、南湾地区，他们实际上有最好的想法。对他们来说，像道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特、艾伦·凯、泰德·尼尔森这样的第一代先驱，在他们看来，计算机不应该区分建造者和用户。它们是同一种媒介。

Engelbart's original paper called Augmenting Human Intellect, when I read that paper, it's like holy shit. If you are making software, if you know how to code or design, this is the highest leverage thing you can do for other people.  

恩格尔巴特的原始论文名为《增强人类智力》，当我读到那篇论文时，感觉棒极了。如果你在制作软件，如果你知道如何编码或设计，那么这是你能为他人做的最有影响力的事情。

So giving them the ability to use computing to augment their problem-solving ability or their intellect, that just got me obsessed with this problem and I want to start a company like Notion.  

因此，让他们能够使用计算来增强他们的解决问题的能力或智力，这让我痴迷于这个问题，我想创办一家像 Notion 这样的公司。

It makes me think of Steve Jobs's famous line of how the computer is a bicycle for the mind.  

这让我想起史蒂夫乔布斯的那句名言：计算机是心灵的自行车。

You know what? Steve Jobs is actually at fault of this in some strange ways. So the story is... Actually, the fact. It's not a story. Xerox PARC has working on the first-generation personal computers called Xerox Alto. Alan Kay was one of the main persons behind it.  

你知道吗？史蒂夫·乔布斯实际上在某些方面对此负有责任。所以这个故事是……事实上，这是事实。这不是一个故事。施乐 PARC 正在开发第一代个人电脑，称为 Xerox Alto。艾伦·凯是幕后主要人物之一。

Alto runs down the system called Smalltalk, which is there's no separation between users and users' app. There's no thing called application. Everything is malleable. You can change the tools.  

Alto 运行 Smalltalk 系统，该系统中用户和用户的应用程序没有任何区别。没有所谓的应用程序。一切都是可塑的。你可以改变工具。

So when Steve Jobs, the famous story is when he went to Xerox PARC to in demo with Alto, he does not... It's the first time he see graphic user interface, one of the first time, and it's also they present them with this Alto system that everything could change. But he did not see the power of it.  

所以当史蒂夫·乔布斯，一个著名的故事是当他去施乐帕克研究中心演示 Alto 时，他没有……这是他第一次看到图形用户界面，也是第一次，也是他们向他们展示了这个 Alto 系统，一切都可能改变。但他没有看到它的威力。

Even when people would demonstrate like, "Hey," Steve Jobs say, "I don't like this direction of scroll bar direction. When you scroll up and down, it shouldn't scroll the opposite reverse direction." Then people just instantly change the scroll bar direction for him. That's the power of the original Smalltalk Alto system. He only saw the graphic user interface.  

即使有人会这样演示，比如“嘿”，史蒂夫·乔布斯说，“我不喜欢这个滚动条方向。上下滚动时，它不应该向相反的方向滚动。”然后人们就会立即为他改变滚动条方向。这就是原始 Smalltalk Alto 系统的强大之处。他只看到了图形用户界面。

He did not see the underlying object or the environment power. As the generation of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made PC, personal computing, popular and they stuck with this an application framework rather than the Smalltalk object framework. Then that has all the apps we have today and has the SaaS route we have today.  

他没有看到底层对象或环境的力量。随着史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨那一代人让个人电脑、个人计算变得流行起来，他们坚持使用应用程序框架而不是 Smalltalk 对象框架。然后它就有了我们今天拥有的所有应用程序，并有我们今天拥有的 SaaS 路线。

That vision of how products should be sounds very familiar and we'll talk about that later of how you think about Notion, but let's assume to the beginning of Notion, when we were chatting earlier, the way you described the early years of Notion, you started Notion in 2013 and some over 10 years ago at this point, you described the first three to four years is the lost years of Notion.  

对于产品应该如何发展的愿景听起来非常熟悉，我们稍后会谈论您对 Notion 的看法，但让我们假设一下 Notion 的开始，当我们之前聊天时，您描述 Notion 的早期阶段的方式是，您在 2013 年创立了 Notion，到现在已经有 10 多年了，您描述说，最初的三到四年是 Notion 失去的岁月。

And I think this is actually a really big deal for founders to hear about because there's all these companies these days, you hear these stats, they had 100 million ARR in two years, in under two years now.  

我认为这对创始人来说确实是一件大事，因为如今所有这些公司，你听到的这些数据，他们在两年内就拥有了 1 亿美元的 ARR，现在还不到两年。

And you don't hear a lot of stories of companies of your scale and success that took three to four years to find product market fit essentially. What went on during these lost years as you described them and just how did you stick with it? That's a long time to stick with something that isn't working.  

你很少听说像你这样规模和成功的公司花了三到四年时间才找到产品市场契合点。你所描述的这些迷失的岁月里发生了什么？你是如何坚持下来的？坚持一件行不通的事情需要很长时间。

Because the goal is always building a computing tool. It's like what product is this? It's really hard to shape the product. The vision is, the dream is there, but the product is very... There's so many paths. We'll try many different versions. The first version to take, okay, everybody can make and create their software.  

因为目标始终是构建计算工具。这是什么产品？塑造产品真的很难。愿景是，梦想是存在的，但产品非常……有很多路径。我们会尝试许多不同的版本。第一个版本是，好吧，每个人都可以制作和创建自己的软件。

So let's just build a developer tool that's so easy that more people can do that. We tried that a couple of years and learned that actually most people just don't care. The majority of people, they wake up, they have report due, they need to get their job done, they don't care creating software to optimize whatever they're doing.  

所以，让我们构建一个非常简单的开发工具，以便更多人可以使用。我们尝试了几年，发现大多数人其实并不关心。大多数人醒来后，有报告要交，需要完成工作，他们不在乎创建软件来优化他们正在做的事情。

They don't care. So we give to our friends, give to investors. It did not resonate with people. But we really want to build that tool so we just keep going and our realization is actually, let's hide our vision, which is everybody can create their software, in the form factor that people do care.  

他们不在乎。所以我们把钱给了我们的朋友，给了投资者。这并没有引起人们的共鸣。但我们真的想开发这个工具，所以我们继续前进，我们的认识实际上是，让我们隐藏我们的愿景，即每个人都可以以人们关心的形式创建自己的软件。

So what kind of tool do people use every day? Productivity software. So that's why it came to Notion today.  

那么人们每天都使用什么样的工具呢？生产力软件。这就是今天来到 Notion 的原因。

If you use Notion, Notion are more understood as the productivity suite, but our intent, and if you use Notion, more you discover intent, which is that it has a no-code developer power into it and you can create almost any kind of productivity software using Notion itself. That took us two plus year to realize.  

如果你使用 Notion，Notion 更像生产力套件，但我们的意图是，如果你使用 Notion，你会发现更多的意图，那就是它具有无代码开发人员功能，你可以使用 Notion 本身创建几乎任何类型的生产力软件。我们花了两年多的时间才实现这一点。

So actually the world is not like you. The world are not developer, designer mind. That the world is they only care what's in front of them and they're so noisy.  

所以实际上这个世界并不像你们那样。这个世界不是开发者、设计师的头脑。这个世界只关心眼前的事情，而且非常吵闹。

There's a quote that this makes me think about where you said, "The first version of Notion was more about what I wanted than what people wanted."  

有一句话让我想起你说过，“Notion 的第一个版本更多地是关于我想要什么，而不是人们想要什么。”

It's very much so because sense of maturation is you don't see the world just from your perspective but from outside your perspective. At tech, we were young. Took us multiple years. It hit your head straight into the wall to realize that. People just don't care.  

很大程度上是因为成熟意味着你不会只从自己的角度看待世界，而是从自己的视角之外看待世界。在科技界，我们还很年轻。我们花了好几年的时间。要意识到这一点，你必须直面现实。人们根本不在乎。

I love the way you phrased that, that you have to hide your vision behind something that people understand and know how to use and...  

我喜欢你表达的方式，你必须将你的视野隐藏在人们理解并知道如何使用的东西背后……

We call it sugar-coated broccoli. People don't want to eat the broccoli but people like sugar, so give them the sugar then hide the broccoli inside of it.  

我们称之为糖衣西兰花。人们不想吃西兰花，但人们喜欢糖，所以给他们糖，然后把西兰花藏在里面。

Wow. The other thing I've heard is that you threw away your code every time, so you rebuilt it many times. You threw away the code each time.  

哇。我听说的另一件事是，你每次都扔掉代码，所以你重建了很多次。你每次都扔掉代码。

That's true. Actually, it took us four year to get somewhere. First two year is that you build too much like developer product. Nobody cares. It took us two year to realize we need to build a productivity tool.  

确实如此。实际上，我们花了四年时间才有所成就。前两年我们开发了太多类似开发者的产品。没人关心。我们花了两年时间才意识到我们需要开发一款生产力工具。

Then it took another year to realize to build this out, but in the middle of that I realized we built on the wrong technical foundation. So eight, 10 years ago, there's computing before. Right now, all the web app runs on React. Before React wins, there's a competing technology called Web Component from Google. And it makes sense.  

然后又花了一年时间才意识到要实现这一点，但在那期间我意识到我们建立在错误的技术基础上。八年、十年前，还有计算。现在，所有的网络应用都在 React 上运行。在 React 获胜之前，谷歌推出了一项名为 Web Component 的竞争技术。这是有道理的。

Web Component feels like a Lego-like, the building block-like, and we're betting on that technology. And then we realize because it's so new, it's just so unstable. It don't know where the bug come from. It's from your source code or from the underlying libraries? Then we have to restart the company, rebuild the whole thing.  

Web Component 就像乐高积木，我们押注于这项技术。然后我们意识到，因为它太新了，所以很不稳定。不知道错误来自哪里。是来自源代码还是来自底层库？然后我们必须重启公司，重建整个系统。

Otherwise, we're going to run out of time. So we set a code base. We set a company so we can build on our own more orthodox technology foundation.  

否则，我们就会没时间了。所以我们设立了一个代码库。我们成立了一家公司，这样我们就可以建立我们自己的更正统的技术基础。

How did you actually stay solvent all this time? A lot of people want to keep working at an idea. Oftentimes they need to pay the bills. How practically were you able to keep working for three to four years? I know there's a story of your mom loaning you some money during that time.  

您是如何一直保持偿付能力的？很多人都想继续为一个想法而努力。他们通常需要支付账单。您是如何实际地坚持工作三到四年的？我知道有这样一个故事，你妈妈在那段时间借给你一些钱。

Well, Chinese mom always can help, and I'm a single child. Yeah, actually my mom helped me kickstart the company because I'm Canadian. In order to move to US, you need to register a company. So my mom helped me with the initial and raised the money. I returned the money to her.  

嗯，中国妈妈总是能帮我，而且我是独生子女。是的，实际上我妈妈帮助我创办了这家公司，因为我是加拿大人。为了搬到美国，你需要注册一家公司。所以我妈妈帮我成立了公司，并筹集了资金。我把钱还给了她。

Then we run out of the money so, "Hey mom, can I borrow that just to bridge us?" Which she did. I'm really grateful for that. How we bridged? How do you last here so long? Because the thing you want to create does not exist, which what is called Notions. It's a Lego for software. It doesn't quite exist.  

然后我们没钱了，于是，“嘿妈妈，我能借这笔钱来弥补我们之间的差距吗？”她借了。我真的很感激。我们是怎么弥补差距的？你是怎么在这里坚持这么久的？因为你想创造的东西并不存在，也就是所谓的概念。它是软件版的乐高积木。它并不完全存在。

There's a Lego for Lego. You can see that in furniture exist, but Lego for software at the usable mass market adoption level doesn't quite exist. And you just want that thing to exist. And I grew up with Legos.  

乐高有自己的特色。家具领域有乐高，但大众市场采用的软件领域乐高还未出现。你只是希望有这样的产品。我是玩着乐高长大的。

It's the only toy I ever wanted, and I want the same feeling of creativity and playfulness to the toy that people can use every day. And my co-founder, Simon, feels the same way. Lego is the only thing he wanted for every Christmas.  

这是我唯一想要的玩具，我希望这个玩具能给人带来同样的创造力和趣味性，让人们每天都能用到它。我的联合创始人西蒙也有同样的感受。乐高是他每个圣诞节唯一想要的东西。

Have you guys seen Magna-Tiles though? I have a one-and-a-half-year-old and Magna-Tiles are quite delightful. I think it's like a pre-Lego. The children can play them.  

你们见过 Magna-Tiles 吗？我有一个一岁半的孩子，Magna-Tiles 非常可爱。我觉得它就像是乐高积木的雏形。孩子们可以玩它们。

Yeah. It's like they're little magnetic plastic planes and then you can build much bigger things really quickly. It's more for babies, but I'm having a blast.  

是的。它们就像是小型磁性塑料飞机，然后你可以快速搭建更大的东西。它更适合婴儿，但我玩得很开心。

Oh, I see it. It's like... Uh-huh.  

哦，我明白了。就像……嗯嗯。

It's a different version of Legos. I like that you're in real-time looking it up. You're like, "Okay, our new vision Magna-Tiles for software."  

这是乐高积木的不同版本。我喜欢实时查找。你会说，“好吧，我们的新愿景是软件版的 Magna-Tiles。”

Now, most people know, "Oh, Magna-Tile." Idea is the same. Modular, right?  

现在，大多数人都知道，“噢，Magna-Tile。”想法是一样的。模块化，对吧？

Yeah, creativity. Okay, back to your story. So there's also a moment where you moved to Japan. Just what was that about? Is that just escape and disconnect?  

是的，创造力。好的，回到你的故事。所以你也曾搬到日本。那是为了什么？那只是逃避和断绝联系吗？

Yeah, that was during one of the rebuild phases. During the... We know what the product should look like. It should be a productivity software with a Lego power hiding inside of it. We build on the wrong technical foundation. And if we continue to build on the wrong ones, we're going to run out of money. Company won't exist.  

是的，那是在重建阶段之一。在……我们知道产品应该是什么样子。它应该是一个生产力软件，其中隐藏着乐高的力量。我们建立在错误的技术基础上。如果我们继续在错误的基础上建设，我们就会耗尽资金。公司将不复存在。

So we decided to lay off everybody. At that time, the Notion was five people. The layout I brought back to me and Simon, two people. And morale obviously there was really low. You have to say goodbye to your teammates.  

所以我们决定裁掉所有人。当时，Notion 团队只有五个人。我带回的布局留给了我和 Simon 两个人。显然，那里的士气非常低落。你不得不和队友说再见。

And so we have the idea, "Let's just go somewhere that we've never been to change the scenery a little bit." And Japan is always top on our list. So the funny thing is if we... And we subleased our apartment and office. We're actually making money living in Japan and then San Francisco.  

因此我们有了这样的想法：“我们去一个从未去过的地方，换换风景吧。”日本一直是我们最想去的地方。有趣的是，如果我们……我们转租了我们的公寓和办公室。我们实际上在日本和旧金山生活赚钱。

So we did that for a while. We actually travel around the world for a while just to change it up, me and Sam just coding every day and design every day. That's some of the happiest moments. Birthday every day.  

所以我们这样做了一段时间。我们实际上环游世界了一段时间，只是为了改变一下，我和 Sam 每天都在编码，每天都在设计。那是最幸福的时刻。每天都是生日。

I saw a stat you're coding 18 hours a day. Here's the quote I heard, :We just code, code, code. Then hey, let's go for food. Then we go eat, go back to work, and do it again."  

我看到一个数据，你每天要写 18 个小时的代码。这是我听到的一句话：“我们只是写代码，写代码，写代码。然后我们去吃饭。然后我们去吃饭，回去工作，再重复一遍。”

Because me and him working so well now. Even back then, it's like you know what each other other people are thinking and you can just cross through the problem space really quickly. The technical product space, design space, and just non-stop of shaping stuff.  

因为现在我和他合作得很好。即使在那时，你也知道对方在想什么，你可以很快地跨越问题空间。技术产品空间、设计空间，以及不停地塑造东西。

So maybe just to close out this thread, for people, for founders that are either struggling and just can't find a thing that's working, "I've been working on something for a long time," I'm curious what advice you'd share for sticking with it.  

所以也许只是为了结束这个话题，对于人们，对于那些正在苦苦挣扎并且找不到可行的东西的创始人来说，“我已经在某件事上工作了很长时间”，我很好奇你会分享什么建议来坚持下去。

And I'll share things I've heard you say so far and I'm curious if there's something you'd add. One is you just believe this needs to exist in the world and you need to really feel this, "I need this to be a thing."  

我会分享我听到过你说过的事情，我很好奇你是否还有什么要补充的。首先，你只是相信这个世界需要存在，你需要真正感受到“我需要它成为现实”。

I think there's an element of staying lean, like you've let everyone go and it's just you and Simon again. There's also this element of disconnecting almost and just going to a different location and just like, "Let's just reset." What other elements do you think are key to you finding something that actually ended up working?  

我认为保持精简是关键，就像你让所有人都离开，只剩下你和西蒙。还有一种几乎断开联系的元素，只是去一个不同的地方，就像“让我们重新开始吧。”你认为还有哪些元素对你找到最终真正有效的东西至关重要？

I'm lucky and Simon lucky that high is never too high, low is never too low for us, so somehow it wasn't feeling too down. Whenever I feel down, I just go to sleep and next day I'm just reset. So that's lucky for me. Definitely don't be afraid to reset.  

我很幸运，西蒙也很幸运，对我们来说，高点永远不会太高，低点永远不会太低，所以不知何故感觉不太沮丧。每当我感到沮丧时，我就会去睡觉，第二天我就会恢复原状。所以这对我来说很幸运。绝对不要害怕恢复原状。

I think courage is quite important because oftentimes you're working on things don't matter, but momentum just took you there. Your first point of building something you want the world to have. What is the building a product or business? You want user. You want revenue. That's a product business. It's almost like a sports. The market is the arena.  

我认为勇气非常重要，因为很多时候你做的事情并不重要，但动力会带你到达那里。你首先要创造一个你想让世界拥有的东西。什么是产品或业务？你想要用户。你想要收入。这是产品业务。这几乎就像一项运动。市场就是竞技场。

Then you'd want to optimize the scorecard where it's building for winning. And I grew up playing sports. I like to compete so I like that. And building for something you want the world to have is building for your value. You have some taste. You have some aesthetic. You have some values.  

然后，你会想要优化记分卡，让它为胜利而努力。我从小就喜欢运动。我喜欢竞争，所以我喜欢这一点。而为你想让世界拥有的东西而努力，就是在为你的价值而努力。你有品味。你有审美。你有价值观。

You want the world to have more of that. They are different energy. I realize actually fairly recently, they're really different. Depends on which day I wake up, I might be in different mood for things, but building for value it's more lasting and more fulfilling.  

你希望这个世界有更多这样的人。他们是不同的能量。事实上，我最近才意识到，他们真的不同。这取决于我哪天醒来，我对事物的心情可能不同，但为价值而建设更持久，更令人满足。

Looking in the thing we're building today and looking back, I find most proud of thing I create something authentic to myself and happen to be also useful for others, and that just keeps you going. And that feels like a more durable energy source for all those dark years, loss years during Notion, and still every day for me.  

回顾我们今天所做的事情，我发现最自豪的事情是我创造了一些真实的东西，而且碰巧对其他人也有用，这让你继续前进。这对我来说就像是一种更持久的能量源泉，可以度过那些黑暗的岁月、在 Notion 期间的失落岁月，以及现在的每一天。

It's interesting you say that because also there's this aspect of it wasn't working initially because you're building it for yourself and not for people, but what I'm hearing is it's still important to build a thing that you are still excited about but also have you go back and forth.  

你这么说很有趣，因为一开始它也不起作用，因为你是为自己而不是为别人建造它，但我听到的是，建造一个让你仍然兴奋的东西仍然很重要，但也需要你来回走动。

Here's what the business needs and here's the thing I'm excited about.  

这是业务所需要的，也是让我兴奋的事情。

Yeah, really a cue. Almost like a therapist, right? It's true. You're building too much for your own self and value without realizing at the end of the day, if you're building a product and tool has to be used by others, you need to create a balance. Too much of yourself, then there's no users.  

是的，这确实是一个暗示。几乎就像治疗师一样，对吧？这是真的。你为了自己的自我和价值而构建了太多东西，却没有意识到，如果你正在构建一个产品和工具必须被其他人使用，那么你需要创造一个平衡。太过自我，就没有用户。

Then you're just doing our project. You're just doing a research project. And too much for a business, you're building a commodity. So where's the spectrum? Yeah, it's never ending spectrum. It's interesting.  

那么你只是在做我们的项目。你只是在做一个研究项目。对于企业来说，这太过分了，你正在打造一种商品。那么频谱在哪里？是的，它是永无止境的频谱。这很有趣。

Yeah, okay. So I'll summarize some of those things you shared of just how to stick with it and stay with an idea and not give up. So I love that you said just get sleep, very Brian Johnson of you, just like, "Get some sleep when it's a real down day. There'll be another day tomorrow." Really simple but...  

是的，好的。所以我将总结一下你分享的一些内容，关于如何坚持下去，坚持一个想法，不要放弃。我喜欢你说的，睡觉就好，就像布莱恩·约翰逊说的，“当心情不好的时候，睡一觉吧。明天还会有新的一天。”真的很简单，但是……

It's like a daily personal physical reset. You can reset your code base. You can reset your mental model.  

这就像每天进行一次个人身体重置。你可以重置你的代码库。你可以重置你的心理模型。

Okay. And then there's also, I love these points. Don't be afraid to reset, as you just said. Tobi Lutke was on the podcast. He said the same thing. "Just be comfortable with some cost. I have done all this already and I will throw it away and start again and that's okay."  

好的。还有，我喜欢这些观点。不要害怕重新开始，就像你刚才说的。Tobi Lutke 在播客上说了同样的话。“只要对一些成本感到满意就行。我已经做了所有这些，我会把它扔掉，重新开始，没关系。”

Yeah. I think it's not just a self-help way to say don't be afraid to reset. That's like, that's okay, that's fine. I think the more interesting point here, it's like you can create progress through better abstractions. And that thing compounds faster, can catch up to all the things you build much quicker than you ever thought.  

是的。我认为这不仅仅是一种自我救助的方式，告诉人们不要害怕重启。就像，没关系，没问题。我认为这里更有趣的一点是，你可以通过更好的抽象来创造进步。而且这种东西复合得更快，可以比你想象的更快地赶上你构建的所有东西。

Or humans are not thinking, not good at thinking in terms of abstraction or exponentials. We're thinking in terms of linearly. If you just reset it and you find a better way to do it, you can get all the thing you have to some cost recovered really quickly.  

或者说人类没有思考能力，不擅长抽象或指数思维。我们以线性思维思考。如果你重新设置它并找到更好的方法，你就可以很快地收回你拥有的一切，而无需付出任何代价。

So actually going back to the computing pioneers part, small talk, one of the first system and a huge influence for Notion was really tiny code base and inspired by Lisp, which is another programming languages and probably a hundred lines of code or something. The kernel of things could be really small, but just like math. It can compound.  

所以实际上回到计算先驱的部分，闲聊一下，第一个系统之一，对 Notion 产生巨大影响的其实是很小的代码库，它受到 Lisp 的启发，Lisp 是另一种编程语言，可能只有一百行代码。事物的核心可能很小，但就像数学一样。它可以复合。

It can have complex behavior that unlocks so much value and things for you. But if you just find those right, you can catch up to all the things you did. You are free to lose really quickly. So I think that's the kernel of why reset is so powerful.  

它可以有复杂的行为，为你解锁很多价值和事物。但如果你找到正确的方法，你就可以弥补你所做的一切。你可以自由地快速失去。所以我认为这就是重置如此强大的核心原因。

And we're seeing exactly what you're describing in LLM advancements these days. All these companies have been working on this for so long and then they've cracked an abstraction of how to think about scaling these systems.  

如今，我们看到的正是您所描述的进步。所有这些公司都已经在这方面努力了很长时间，然后他们破解了如何扩展这些系统的抽象概念。

And now just people launch them and are immediately where the companies that have been working this for decades are today because they are building off these abstractions as you described in these.  

现在人们只需启动它们，就能立即达到那些已经从事这项工作几十年的公司今天的水平，因为他们正在构建这些抽象，就像您所描述的那样。

Trying to caught up the US really quickly.  

试图迅速赶上美国。

With DeepSeek, yeah. The point you also made about momentum, be weary of momentum taking you in direction and moving in a different... not being stuck to that direction is exactly the way I think the chain of thought models network actually where generally LLMs are like, next word, next word, next word, next word.  

是的，使用 DeepSeek。你还提到了关于动量的观点，要警惕动量带你走向不同的方向......不要固守那个方向，这正是我认为思维链模型网络实际上的方式，通常LLMs就像，下一个词，下一个词，下一个词，下一个词。

And if they ever make a wrong turn, they're stuck. They keep going from that path. And these chain of thought models are now good at just like, wait, let me rethink. Is this actually the right path or should I start again? So I feel like AI has almost figured out exactly what you're describing.  

如果他们走错了路，他们就会被困住。他们会继续沿着那条路走下去。这些思维链模型现在擅长的是，等一下，让我再想一想。这真的是正确的路吗，还是我应该重新开始？所以我觉得人工智能几乎已经弄清楚了你所描述的一切。

Oh, man. Okay, last question about the early years. Everyone's always wondering what does product market fit feel like? You worked on it for three to four years. What was the moment? What would it look like? What was different when you're like, "Okay, this is going to work"?  

哦，伙计。好的，最后一个问题是关于早年。每个人都想知道产品市场契合度是什么感觉？你为此工作了三到四年。那一刻是什么感觉？它会是什么样子？当你觉得“好吧，这会成功”时，有什么不同？

I think going back to me and Simon, high is never that high, low is never that low, it never hit us as a binary state. Just like, "Oh, good. We have people who care about this thing we make now. Oh, good. People reach out to us who are paying us." And it's a very gradual ramp.  

我想回到我和西蒙的话题，高点永远不会那么高，低点永远不会那么低，它从来都不是二元状态。就像，“哦，太好了。现在有人关心我们制造的东西。哦，太好了。有人联系我们，付钱给我们。”这是一个非常渐进的过程。

Maybe that's why early days when it's really the lost eras, it doesn't feel too low because it just... Even for Notion today, it feels like it's so small in terms of where it could be. It just they keep going, right? It's a less of a milestone way to thinking about things.  

也许这就是为什么早期真的是迷失的时代，但感觉并不低落，因为它只是……即使对于今天的 Notion，感觉它还很小。他们只是继续前进，对吧？这是一种不那么具有里程碑意义的思考方式。

It's more just like, "Can we do the same that's in our head and better than we did last week?" way of thinking about things. So there's a such movement that product market, boom, milestone achieved. Didn't feel that way.  

这更像是“我们能不能做到和我们脑子里想的一样，而且比上周做得更好？”这样思考问题的方式。所以有这样的运动，产品市场、繁荣、里程碑的实现。感觉不是那样的。

I've heard that from a lot of founders actually. Was there a moment in that point of just like, "Oh, this is different," or, "Maybe it's going to work this time"?  

实际上，很多创始人都这么说过。在那个时刻，有没有想过“哦，这不一样”，或者“也许这次会成功”？

I think for a while, okay, once we start revenue, product grows faster now. Investors start knocking on the door was like, I remember one day it's like there's a dog food, dog treats sent to our entire office. So first of all, office wasn't public, the address. And the dog treats, why do people want this so much?  

我想，有一段时间，一旦我们开始盈利，产品增长就会更快。投资者开始敲门，我记得有一天，好像有狗粮、狗零食送到了我们整个办公室。首先，办公室地址不是公开的。还有狗零食，为什么人们这么想要这个？

So that was a moment I paused a little bit and I guess there's enough attraction for investors.  

所以那一刻我稍稍停顿了一下，我想这对投资者来说具有足够的吸引力。

And the dog treats were trying to... It was like a gift to be like, "Hey, you should talk to us. We're sending this fun gift."  

这些狗食试图……就像一份礼物，就像是说：“嘿，你应该和我们谈谈。我们送了这份有趣的礼物。”

Yeah, because of the way how we just hire someone in the office as a dog. Then I think we post on Twitter or something. And I said, "Why did this show up to our office?" Someone really hustled into where we are in our office address and follow us on Twitter.  

是的，因为我们在办公室里雇佣了一个人当狗。然后我想我们会在推特上发帖。我说，“为什么这个会出现在我们办公室？”有人真的匆匆赶到我们办公室地址并在推特上关注我们。

Did you end up taking their money?  

最后你拿了他们的钱吗？

Not the first time, yeah.  

是的，这不是第一次了。

Okay, later. Okay, it's long game.  

好的，稍后再说。好的，这是一场持久战。

Awesome. So I've never heard that before. Sign product market fit as VCs are starting to... You start getting a lot more messaging and cold outreach from VCs.  

太棒了。我以前从未听说过。随着风险投资家开始……签署产品市场契合度，您会开始收到更多来自风险投资家的消息和冷门推广。

Actually, I had one of our investor, it's really helpful because all those years you just like there's no feedback loop. You just go for it. Then the feedback loop gradually show up. Then for a while it's, oh, VCs start knocking on doors. So I should talk to those people. The people like what we're doing.  

实际上，我有一位投资者，这真的很有帮助，因为这么多年来你只是觉得没有反馈循环。你只能去做。然后反馈循环逐渐出现。然后有一段时间，哦，风险投资家开始上门找我。所以我应该和那些人谈谈。人们喜欢我们正在做的事情。

I did some meetings, quite a few of meetings. Maybe it doesn't... I realize and one of the members is saying, "Ivan, what are you doing? You clearly don't need money. You're just trying to feel good to do external validation about this." And I said, "Oh, that's so true."  

我开过一些会议，相当多。也许不是......我意识到了，其中一位成员说：“伊万，你在做什么？你显然不需要钱。你只是想通过外部验证来让自己感觉良好。”我说：“哦，那太对了。”

It doesn't help us make a better product and the truth is with what customer tell us. Then we just went back to building. I went back to hardcore building, no meeting modes. That's where the dog food story came about and realized, "Oh." It's interesting.  

它不会帮助我们制造出更好的产品，事实就是客户告诉我们的。然后我们就回去继续建造。我又回到了硬核建造，没有会议模式。这就是狗粮故事的由来，我意识到，“哦。”这很有趣。

You mentioned this investor, they said it was really helpful. Is you want to give them some credit or do you want to keep-  

你提到了这位投资者，他们说这真的很有帮助。你是想给他们一些荣誉，还是想保留-

Oh, Shana Fisher. She's in New York.  

哦，莎娜·费舍尔。她在纽约。

Yeah, she's like another therapist, right?  

是的，她就像另一位治疗师，对吗？

This episode is brought to you by Sinch, the customer communications cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Sinch comes in.  

本期节目由客户通信云 Sinch 为您呈现。以下是关于数字客户通信的内容。无论您发送的是营销活动、验证码还是帐户提醒，您都需要它们可靠地联系到用户。这就是 Sinch 的作用所在。

Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally, use Sinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about, Rich Communication Services or RCS. Think of RCS as SMS 2.0.  

超过 15 万家企业（包括全球 10 大科技公司中的 8 家）使用 Sinch 的 API 来构建其产品中的消息传递、电子邮件和通话功能。产品团队需要了解消息传递领域正在发生的重大事件，即富通信服务 (RCS)。将 RCS 视为 SMS 2.0。

Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies. And here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.  

您的用户无需下载任何新内容，即可看到经过验证的公司名称和徽标，而无需接收随机号码发送的短信。这是一种更安全、更有品牌的体验，此外，您还可以获得交互式轮播和建议回复等功能。这就是这很重要的原因。美国运营商开始采用 RCS。

Sinch is already helping major brands send RCS around the world, and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market. Learn more and get started at sinch.com/lenny. That's S-I-N-C-H.com/lenny.  

Sinch 已在帮助各大品牌将 RCS 推广到世界各地，他们还帮助 Lenny 的播客听众在美国市场热潮来临之前率先注册。了解更多信息并开始使用，请访问 sinch.com/lenny。网址为 SINCH.com/lenny。

I want to shift to talking about Notion today and the way you've approached it and a good segue is what you've been talking about right now is how lean and efficient you've been and how that's been a big priority for you. So a few stats I've seen. One is that you guys are profitable.  

今天我想谈谈 Notion，以及你处理它的方式，一个很好的过渡就是你现在谈论的是如何精简和高效，以及这对你来说是多么重要。我看到了一些数据。一个是你们盈利了。

You've been profitable for a couple of years now. I don't know if you've spent even the money you've raised. I think most of it is still in the...  

你已经盈利好几年了。我不知道你是否已经花光了筹集到的资金。我认为大部分资金仍在……

It's still in the bank. You're nodding, if you're on YouTube. You didn't have a salesperson until you hit over 10 million ARR. You hired your first PM at 50 people. You've always kept the team generally really small. Why is that been important to you? It's very cool now. Everyone's like, "Of course, that's how it should be."  

它仍在银行里。如果你在 YouTube 上，你会点头。直到你的 ARR 超过 1000 万时，你才有销售人员。你在 50 人的时候就聘请了第一位 PM。你一直保持团队规模很小。为什么这对你来说很重要？现在很酷。每个人都说，“当然，应该这样。”

But for the past decade, that has not been the case. You've always been that way. Why has that been so important?  

但过去十年，情况并非如此。你一直都是这样。为什么这如此重要？

I think going back to the abstraction system way of problem solving, I think we're lucky that me and Simon and Akshay, we have the skillset you probably can run a whole company, which is a couple of us, I can design, I can do marketing, storytelling, close sales deals. So you realize you don't need a lot.  

我认为回到抽象系统解决问题的方法，我认为我们很幸运，我、西蒙和阿克沙伊拥有可以经营整个公司的技能，我们几个人就可以经营整个公司，我可以设计，我可以做营销、讲故事、完成销售交易。所以你会意识到你不需要很多。

But when you can do a lot at the same time or hire people who can do that, naturally keep the company small. And you all know you're doing product management. The overhead is actually more from internal communication. It's really hard to get people's mind to be aligned on things, to see the world in the same way.  

但是，当你可以同时做很多事情或雇佣能做这些事情的人时，自然会保持公司规模较小。大家都知道你在做产品管理。管理费用实际上更多来自内部沟通。让人们的想法保持一致、以同样的方式看待世界真的很难。

And the part that you do need people, maybe you can solve better through systems, through better tools. Notion itself is a meta tool to build other tools. So we pretty much run everything on Notion. We use the same mindset to build our company.  

至于你确实需要人手的部分，也许你可以通过系统、通过更好的工具来更好地解决。Notion 本身是一个构建其他工具的元工具。所以我们几乎在 Notion 上运行一切。我们用同样的心态来建立我们的公司。

And accidentally, that keep our headcount low, keep our company profitable, which then puts you on a positive treadmill of you don't have to go for the next 18, 24 months to find money. You can just focus on building. And also because your team's small, we have this internal Notion called talent density.  

意外的是，这让我们的员工人数保持在较低水平，保持公司盈利，这让你处于一个积极的状态，你不必在接下来的 18、24 个月里四处寻找资金。你可以专注于建设。而且因为你的团队很小，我们有这个内部概念，称为人才密度。

We don't try to track number of people but we try to track how talent-dense, revenue per employee we are. And people want to work with either more talented people. So it's a positive company group.  

我们不会试图追踪员工数量，而是试图追踪人才密度和每位员工的收入。人们希望与更有才华的人一起工作。所以这是一个积极的公司群体。

I wonder how much of this is actually from being around for so many years without success of, "We just have to stay very lean and save our cash because otherwise, we'll die." Do you think that was a formative experience to inform how you want to operate or is that always something?  

我想知道，这在多大程度上是因为多年来一直没有成功，“我们必须保持精简并节省现金，否则我们就会死。”你认为这是一段成长经历，让你知道你想要如何经营，还是一直都是这样？

No, I wouldn't say we're, Notion, is a cost saving-first company. I like fancy chairs. I like furniture. But we're not wasting money. I think it's more just from a taste or approach to problem solving. I just believe better system is much better than brute force through people.  

不，我不会说 Notion 是一家以节约成本为第一要务的公司。我喜欢高档椅子。我喜欢家具。但我们不会浪费钱。我认为这更多的是一种品味或解决问题的方法。我只是相信更好的系统比通过人力强力解决问题要好得多。

When people hear this idea of staying lean and staying small, it sounds great or we're going to be super efficient and lean and smart with our money and down dense. It's very hard to do and it's very hard not to hire more engineers, more designers. What advice do you have for folks that want to operate this way?  

当人们听到保持精简和小规模的想法时，听起来很棒，或者我们将非常高效、精简和明智地利用我们的资金和密集的资源。这很难做到，很难不雇佣更多的工程师、更多的设计师。对于那些想以这种方式运营的人，你有什么建议？

What has allowed you to actually be successful while staying lean and not having as many engineers as competitors, many designers as competitors?  

是什么让您在保持精简的同时，并且没有那么多工程师和设计师作为竞争对手，从而取得了成功？

I think just understand abstraction or system is a better curve than pecan curve, right? Linear. We internally help other people and understand this. Internally we use the metaphor that Notion's a small bus. The bus, the smaller the bus, it's easier to turn corners, easier to accelerate, easier to maneuver.  

我认为，仅仅理解抽象或系统就比山核桃曲线更好，对吧？线性。我们在内部帮助其他人并理解这一点。在内部，我们使用 Notion 是一辆小型巴士的比喻。巴士越小，转弯就越容易，加速就越容易，操纵就越容易。

The bigger the bus it is, bigger the boat or bigger the bus, slow down. And as a leader in the company, you decide who sit around you on the bus seats. That dictates how fast our overall bus moves, dictate your work and life experience at this company because you pick your roommate, you pick your seat mates.  

巴士越大，船越大，巴士越大，速度越慢。作为公司的领导者，你可以决定谁坐在你周围的巴士座位上。这决定了我们整个巴士的行驶速度，决定了你在这家公司的工作和生活体验，因为你可以选择你的室友，你可以选择你的座位伙伴。

That metaphor clicks with people inside a company and overall help us optimize to make the bus link.  

这个比喻引起了公司内部人员的共鸣，并且总体上帮助我们优化了公交线路。

I've never heard of that metaphor before.  

我以前从未听说过这个比喻。

It probably came up somewhere but... Or it does not.  

它可能出现在某个地方但...或者没有出现。

Small bus. So along these lines actually, so I visited the office recently and I noticed that it's just a very cozy vibe.  

小型巴士。实际上就是这样，所以我最近参观了办公室，发现那里的氛围非常舒适。

And I learned that you had a rule of no shoes in the office for a long time until the last office, that you all ate around one table for a long time, that you try 30 different shades of warm white on the walls before you chose. Why is that important to you?  

我还了解到，你们一直到最后一间办公室都奉行不穿鞋的办公室规定，你们都围着一张桌子吃饭很长时间，你们会在墙壁上试涂 30 种不同色调的暖白色，然后再做出选择。为什么这对你很重要？

Why is it so important to be so thoughtful about the office experience?  

为什么对办公室体验如此重视如此重要？

Maybe there are two dimension part of it. One is the pragmatic part. You just want office to be a pleasant experience to be at. Therefore, most office, the top light feels like hospital. You're just like, "Oh, man." And the white is so pale and the floor is so dark.  

也许有两个方面。一个是实用方面。你只是希望办公室能给你带来愉快的体验。因此，大多数办公室的顶灯感觉就像医院一样。你会觉得，“哦，天哪。”白色太淡了，地板太暗了。

Why use some kind of cream, make floors more friendly colors? And don't use top light. Top light is evil. So just the office feels cozy so people spend more time. You feel more creative, more at ease in the office space.So the vision work we have is should feels like artist studio or should feel like your home.  

为什么要使用某种乳白色，让地板颜色更友好？不要使用顶灯。顶灯是邪恶的。所以办公室感觉舒适，人们会花更多时间。在办公室里你会更有创造力，更自在。所以我们的愿景是工作应该感觉像艺术家工作室或应该感觉像你的家。

And that's why most our office furniture are home furnitures. It just feels cozy. That's more so people spend more time, feels more creative, juices flow better. The other world just like at least personally for me, it hurts the eyes if you just see ugly things. It's more from a value aesthetic front.  

这就是为什么我们大多数办公室家具都是家用家具。感觉很舒适。这更多的是为了让人们花更多的时间，感觉更有创造力，思维更活跃。另一方面，至少对我个人而言，如果你只看到丑陋的东西，眼睛就会痛。这更多的是从价值美学的角度来说的。

It's like we talk about ergonomic chairs. Does it hurt your back when you sit on bad chairs? But you have more visual improve from, at least for me from the eyes. If the chair looks ugly, the wall looks ugly, it hurts. So it's better to not have thing that hurts.  

就像我们谈论人体工学椅一样。坐在不好的椅子上会伤到你的背吗？但视觉效果会更好，至少对我来说是眼睛。如果椅子看起来丑陋，墙壁看起来丑陋，那就很伤人。所以最好不要有伤人的东西。

You also have a really interesting naming convention for your conference rooms.  

您的会议室也有一个非常有趣的命名约定。

Yeah, that's true. Yeah. We name our conference room after timeless tools in history. So there, I'll give you an example. iPhone's obvious one, original Macintosh, various different form of chairs, Lamy's 2000 pens, Toshiba rice cookers, and other ones because they're inspirations. They're just like at the end of the day, we're creating a tool.  

是的，没错。是的。我们用历史上永恒的工具来命名我们的会议室。那么，我来举个例子。iPhone 很明显，第一代 Macintosh，各种不同形式的椅子，Lamy 2000 钢笔，东芝电饭煲，还有其他的，因为它们是灵感。它们就像我们在一天结束时创造的工具一样。

We're creating a meta tool. A lot of people to create tools, software tools. And Toshiba rice cooker changed how people eat rice in Asia for a hundred million, tens of a hundred million people. The Sony transistor radio is the first one to shrink something small and useful for people.  

我们正在创造一种元工具。许多人都在创造工具、软件工具。东芝电饭煲改变了亚洲一亿、几亿人的吃饭方式。索尼晶体管收音机是第一个将东西缩小到对人们有用的东西。

And those things change people's life and last for decades. What it's like to create a software product like that? I want to inspire my team to think that way. Because software, and especially tech, it's every six months, every 12 months cycle. We don't think enough about creating something that lasts.  

这些东西改变了人们的生活，并持续了几十年。创造这样的软件产品是什么感觉？我想激励我的团队这样思考。因为软件，尤其是技术，每六个月、每 12 个月都会有一次更新周期。我们并没有充分考虑创造持久的东西。

I care creating something that at least the form factor lasts longer than 18 month.  

我关心的是创造一些至少外形可以持续使用超过 18 个月的东西。

There's a quote that you tweeted once that I think of as you talk about this from Steve Jobs. "The problem is that there's just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product." I don't know if you remember tweeting that, but just what do you think of when you hear that?  

谈到这个话题时，我想起了史蒂夫·乔布斯曾经说过的一句话：“问题在于，伟大的创意和伟大的产品之间，需要大量的工艺。”我不知道你是否还记得自己发过这条推文，但当你听到这句话时，你会想到什么？

Yeah, I think the key word here is craft. Internally, our company philosophy called crafts and values. Craft is your skill set, your taste. Value is your personal value and how do you see the world. Craft is interesting word.  

是的，我认为这里的关键词是工艺。在公司内部，我们的公司理念是工艺和价值观。工艺是你的技能，你的品味。价值是你的个人价值以及你如何看待世界。工艺是一个有趣的词。

It's like about apply your value to some technical know-how and to make more clever trade-offs to create something new and useful and just keep doing that. My wife often refer me as a wood cabinet builder.  

这就像将您的价值应用于一些技术诀窍，并做出更明智的权衡以创造一些新的和有用的东西，并继续这样做。我的妻子经常称我为木柜建造者。

That's how at least my mindset training towards building Notion is like, "Oh, can I make this wood cabinet more beautiful and more useful and feels nicer on your hand?" And that's like you have aesthetic direction towards it and you have your technical know-how to actually make things happen.  

至少这就是我在构建 Notion 时所接受的思维训练，就像“哦，我可以让这个木柜更漂亮、更实用、拿在手上感觉更舒服吗？” 就像你对它有审美方向，并且你有技术诀窍来真正实现它。

Then you need to do permutation and trade-off in your head where on paper and to get there. That to me, that's craft. And building product, to me at least, to me feels that way. Building business feels that way. Building company feels that way.  

然后你需要在脑子里进行排列和权衡，并在纸面上进行，才能达到目标。对我来说，这就是手艺。至少对我来说，打造产品就是这样。打造业务就是这样。打造公司就是这样。

It's interesting that so much of this conversation is this and the way you think about building this company is this balance between practical, useful things people need and business and practical stuff, and then the value of building something you're proud of and craft.  

有趣的是，这次谈话的大部分内容都是这样的，而你对建立这家公司的看法是在人们需要的实用、有用的东西与商业和实用的东西之间取得平衡，然后是建立你引以为豪的东西和精心打造的东西的价值。

And there's always this trade-off almost of speed and quality, and I know that's an important element for you. Just thinking about trade-offs between decisions, so talk about just trade-offs, just how you think about making a trade-off.  

速度和质量之间总是存在着这种权衡，我知道这对你来说很重要。只是考虑决策之间的权衡，所以只谈论权衡，只谈论你如何考虑做出权衡。

Yeah, I think this is quite relevant especially for product makers and business makers is there's no free lunch. You don't get something for free. You have to give up something. Then what do you give up? It's essentially you give up the right thing that market or your user wants at that given space and time.  

是的，我认为这与产品制造商和企业制造商息息相关，因为天下没有免费的午餐。你不会得到免费的东西。你必须放弃一些东西。那么你放弃什么呢？本质上，你放弃的是市场或用户在特定时间和空间想要的正确的东西。

It's just the craft of building a business or building a product. And that the market is so dynamic, especially now with AI. The optimized function for the market changes so then you need to make new trade-off and new technology emerges. I always feels like AI language model feels like a new type of wood. It feels like aluminum.  

这只是建立企业或打造产品的技巧。而且市场如此充满活力，尤其是现在有了人工智能。针对市场优化的功能会发生变化，因此你需要做出新的权衡，新技术也会不断涌现。我总是觉得人工智能语言模型就像是一种新型木材。它就像铝一样。

It's a new type of material. So you can make... Mass air travel wasn't available until aluminum become cheap enough that people can make airplanes that support this at cost.  

这是一种新型材料。所以你可以制造……直到铝变得足够便宜，人们才能以成本价制造出支持这种技术的飞机，大众航空旅行才得以实现。

And it's like computer wasn't there until semiconductor becomes... It's like require new technology to unlock new way to making trade-offs, and then you need to balance the technology trade-off with human behavior trade-off. As a human, ever since we got out of Africa, we're set, right? That's a constraint. It's invariable.  

就像计算机直到半导体出现才出现一样……就像需要新技术来解锁做出权衡的新方法，然后你需要平衡技术权衡和人类行为权衡。作为人类，自从我们走出非洲以来，我们就固定了，对吧？这是一个限制。它是不变的。

And every generation pick up some new things but after you're 16 years old you don't want to learn new things. So those are there are the people trade-off, technology trade-off. There's some macro. There's a different dimension of things just cooking together that come together as a product more as a business than what is that?  

每一代人都会学到一些新东西，但过了 16 岁，你就不想学习新东西了。所以这些都是人力权衡、技术权衡。这是宏观层面的问题。烹饪是不同的维度，它们结合在一起形成一种产品，更像是一种生意，而不是什么？

And I think a product maker, business maker's job is to find that sweet spot of all the multiple dimensions, then create something has a right to exist. At least it's more durable to exist.  

我认为产品制造商、企业创造者的工作就是找到所有维度的最佳平衡点，然后创造出有生存权利的东西。至少它的存在会更持久。

And I'm hearing there's this thread of just like with new technologies, what is now possible. And I know you guys are doing some cool stuff with AI that I'm going to get to that is unlocking some cool new ideas. But before I get there, I want to talk about just you as a leader.  

我听说有这样一个话题，就像新技术一样，现在有什么可能。我知道你们正在用人工智能做一些很酷的事情，我接下来会讲到这些事情，它们正在释放一些很酷的新想法。但在讲这些之前，我想先谈谈你作为领导者的情况。

At this point, you've been at this for 12 years, something like that.  

到目前为止，你已经在这个领域工作了 12 年了。

Like that, yeah.  就像这样，是的。

And if you don't mind me saying, you're a soft-spoken leader, which is you're not like the archetype of what people imagine is like the CEO of a 10 billion... And I'm sure you guys are valued much more now. I don't even know. That was probably an old valuation.  

如果您不介意的话，我可以说，您是一位说话温和的领导者，也就是说，您并不像人们想象中的 100 亿美元 CEO 那样......我敢肯定，你们现在的价值要高得多。我甚至不知道。那可能是以前的估值。

I think it's great for people to see leaders like you that are not necessarily the classic archetype of CO, and I imagine there are things you've had to work on and build and lean into that aren't natural to you to step into this role of this increasingly growing, high-scale business.  

我认为，让人们看到您这样的领导者是件好事，您不一定是典型的 CO，而且我可以想象，您必须努力去构建和依靠一些东西，而这些东西对您来说并不自然，无法胜任这个日益增长、规模庞大的企业的职位。

What are some of the areas you've had to most build and learn to do that didn't come naturally to you?  

您必须构建并学习哪些对您来说不是自然而然的领域？

I guess you've never been in a business meeting or brainstorm session with me. You're not there.  

我猜你从来没和我一起参加过商务会议或头脑风暴会议。你不在那里。

Haven't seen that side of Ivan Zhao.  

还没见过 Ivan Zhao 的这一面。

Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm the most soft interaction person at work. It's actually the reverse is true because I grew up in China. People way more direct. People just say what they want, say what they think.  

是的，我不会说我是工作中互动最温和的人。事实恰恰相反，因为我是在中国长大的。中国人更直接。人们只说他们想要的，说出他们的想法。

And you move to California, you move to US, you move to the West, you felt wow, everybody says everything's wonderful, everything's nice, but that's not true. I would say Notion's ethos probably more like a East Coast rather than West Coast, so somewhere in between. It's more direct. What do you want to learn? A bunch of things.  

然后你搬到加利福尼亚，搬到美国，搬到西部，你会觉得哇，每个人都说一切都很棒，一切都很好，但事实并非如此。我想说 Notion 的精神可能更像东海岸而不是西海岸，所以介于两者之间。它更直接。你想学什么？很多东西。

I think the early days is we talk about that the world's not like you. The world don't care about you so you have to shave off the idealistic part of you to go something that's like the world actually cares, the sugar coat of broccoli. You have to hide the broccoli within something, the sugar pills. So that's one.  

我认为早期我们谈论的是世界和你不一样。世界不关心你，所以你必须削去你身上理想主义的部分，去做一些世界真正关心你的事情，比如西兰花的糖衣。你必须把西兰花藏在糖丸里。这就是其中之一。

That's more self. That's more myself. As company grows, you realize... I'm pretty good at storytelling. So that's a one-to-one influence. But as a company grows, you realize you need to be one-to-many storytellers. That's a skill. The one reason I try not to do podcasts and all those things, oh, it's actually it drains energy in a different ways.  

这更关乎自我。更关乎我自己。随着公司的发展，你会意识到……我很擅长讲故事。所以这是一种一对一的影响。但随着公司的发展，你会意识到你需要成为一对多的故事讲述者。这是一项技能。我尽量不做播客和所有那些事情的一个原因是，哦，这实际上会以不同的方式消耗精力。

I prefer just building product and brainstorm sessions. Then you realize it's a necessary craft for me to pick up in order to change the shape of the company, the business I'm building. I treat it like a craft. There's some things skill that's in the video game.  

我更喜欢开发产品和集思广益。然后你就会意识到，为了改变公司和我正在建立的业务的形态，这对我来说是一门必备的技能。我把它当成一门手艺。电子游戏中有些东西需要技巧。

You need to pick up something to unlock something else and to make new demand, you trade off with yourself and the business. That's fun though. Every 12, 18 month, Notion's like a new company or at least they require different skill set coming from me. So I need to pick up new things.  

你需要学习一些东西来解锁其他东西，并提出新的需求，你需要在自己和企业之间做出权衡。不过这很有趣。每 12、18 个月，Notion 就像一家新公司，或者至少他们需要我具备不同的技能。所以我需要学习新的东西。

And it's an infinite game and infinite games are more fun.  

这是一场无限游戏，无限游戏更有趣。

I love this idea. I love that you keep coming back to this idea of there's the ideals and the values and the vision and what you're trying to do, and then you have to find the way to frame it and package it so that people actually understand and want it. And that's how you get in.  

我喜欢这个想法。我喜欢你不断回到这个想法，有理想、价值观、愿景和你想做的事情，然后你必须找到方法来构建和包装它，这样人们才能真正理解和想要它。这就是你加入的方式。

Yeah. It's like human minds are resistant to change, and how do you land in people's head? Through my best word marketing and positioning are for. So you need to find the sweet spot to get in. And you also be truthful. It's not just deceiving. So deceiving is not truthful.  

是的。就好像人类的思想抗拒改变，你如何才能进入人们的头脑？用我最擅长的词来说，营销和定位就是为了这个目的。所以你需要找到最佳切入点。你也要诚实。这不仅仅是欺骗。所以欺骗不是诚实。

You can fool other people once or twice, then there's no future. It has to be actually tied back to something genuinely the value creating or the exchange with the other person. So yeah, it's a craft. Storytelling is the vast dimension of making trade-offs.  

你可以欺骗别人一两次，但那将没有未来。它必须与真正创造价值或与他人交换的东西联系起来。所以，是的，这是一门手艺。讲故事是权衡取舍的广阔维度。

I love this word, trade-offs. Comes up again and again too. It's so interesting that there's these threads that have come up again and again in our chat.  

我喜欢这个词，权衡。这个词也反复出现。在我们的聊天中，这些话题反复出现，这太有趣了。

Along that journey of becoming this leader that you've become, what would you say has maybe the biggest surprise or most unexpected part of the journey of something you've had to learn to do or something that didn't turn out the way you expected? Just as a personal growth story.  

在成为领导者的历程中，您认为最大的惊喜或最意想不到的部分是什么？您必须学会做什么？或者事情没有按照您预期的方式发展？就当做个人成长故事吧。

If you use the product in the past three years, you realize Notion product, you realize, "Hey, we actually ship bunch of things not so great." Two years ago. Actually last year, 2024, is the year that I can say we ship good stuff at good velocity and good quality and align with our values.  

如果您在过去三年内使用过该产品，您会意识到 Notion 产品，您会意识到，“嘿，我们实际上交付了很多不太好的东西。”两年前。实际上，去年，即 2024 年，我可以说我们以良好的速度和质量交付了好产品，并符合我们的价值观。

We get lost there for a year, a year and a half shipping something not according to our value, not according to my value. Notion, we call Notion is Lego for software. We ship non-Lego pieces into our product. We're still there. We're still cleaning up part of it. That's a realization.  

我们在那里迷失了一年、一年半，推出了一些不符合我们价值观、不符合我的价值观的东西。Notion，我们称其为软件版的乐高。我们将非乐高零件放入我们的产品中。我们仍然在那里。我们仍在清理其中的一部分。这是一种认识。

It's like going back to the value part, it's like if you create this thing called a product or business, you attract people are value aligned to it.  

这就像回到价值部分，就像如果你创造了这种称为产品或业务的东西，你就会吸引与之价值一致的人们。

Then if you're trying to optimize too much on this competition revenue side of things, forced to introducing something anti-your-value, then the system, it's like there's organ rejection with your employees, with your customers. I'll give you a concrete example. For a while and still is, project management is one of the most important use cases for Notion.  

然后，如果你试图在竞争收入方面进行过多的优化，被迫引入一些与你的价值相悖的东西，那么系统就像你的员工和客户产生器官排斥一样。我给你举一个具体的例子。一段时间以来，项目管理一直是 Notion 最重要的用例之一。

And you can get a better project management tool just by hard coding things like sprints, milestones, all those things into your product, or you can do it in the way the Notion are being, through Lego pieces. What are the sprint? Sprints are clusters of a task that group together. So it's a new Lego.  

您只需将诸如冲刺、里程碑等内容硬编码到您的产品中，就可以获得更好的项目管理工具，或者您可以像 Notion 那样通过乐高积木来实现。什么是冲刺？冲刺是将一组任务组合在一起。所以这是一个新的乐高。

So introducing Lego is much harder, slower. You can instead we hard-code a sprint concept into the product. And this doesn't quite fit. And took me at least a year, a year and a half to realize that's not the way we should continue building Notion. We should go back the original Lego way of building the product.  

因此，引入 Lego 会更困难、更慢。相反，我们可以将冲刺概念硬编码到产品中。但这并不合适。我花了至少一年、一年半的时间才意识到，这不是我们继续构建 Notion 的方式。我们应该回到最初的 Lego 构建产品的方式。

So we changed quite a bit internally. Now, it feels good now. Building according to your values is the meta point, at least for me.  

因此，我们在内部做出了很大改变。现在感觉很好。根据你的价值观进行建设是最重要的，至少对我来说是这样。

Okay, I got to follow this thread. What is it that you changed that allowed you to come back to your first principles? Was it like you step... Is it founder mode was the answer? Is it people, personnel shift? What allowed you to change the way things were going?  

好的，我得继续关注这个话题。你做了哪些改变，让你重新回到最初的原则？就像你所做的那样……创始人模式是答案吗？是人员、人员变动吗？是什么让你改变了事情的发展方向？

I would say all of that above, but especially just release the sprint product through our community and customers. Then it's like what is this? It's like underpowered compared to other competitor products to doing product management and it doesn't work well with the rest of Notion like I said.  

我想说的是以上所有，但特别是通过我们的社区和客户发布 Sprint 产品。那么这是什么？与其他竞争产品相比，它在产品管理方面能力不足，而且就像我说的，它与 Notion 的其他部分配合得不好。

And if you talk with engineers, they'll say, "Okay, there's this part of Notion you have to touch the code base. That's just weird. That's your hardcore too much into it. From all the dimension technical front, calling a customer. And when you use the thing it just doesn't feel right."  

如果你和工程师交谈，他们会说，“好吧，Notion 的这个部分你必须接触代码库。这很奇怪。这是你太过投入的核心。从所有技术方面来看，打电话给客户。当你使用这个东西时，感觉不对劲。”

So there's another saying that if you build in a Lego way inside Notion in the code base or product, the system work for you. If you're building non-Lego way, the system work against you. So in some sense, we're creating a tool that has emergent behavior, inter-channeling that emergent behavior to unlock more values.  

因此，还有另一种说法，如果你在 Notion 的代码库或产品中以乐高的方式构建，系统就会为你工作。如果你以非乐高的方式构建，系统就会与你作对。因此，从某种意义上说，我们正在创建一种具有突发行为的工具，并将这种突发行为相互引导以解锁更多价值。

So I'm hearing as you launched it, it just didn't go well. Everyone's just like, "What is this? This isn't feeling good." And there's a moment of realization of I see. Here's what we did wrong here and we should come back to this original abstraction vision of what we're trying to build.  

所以我听说你们推出它时，进展并不顺利。每个人都在想，“这是什么？感觉不太好。”然后我意识到了。这就是我们在这里做错的事情，我们应该回到我们试图构建的最初的抽象愿景。

That took nine months, a year to realize sometime.  

这花了九个月甚至一年的时间才实现。

Along those lines actually, people come on this podcast and they share all these stories of things are going awesome all the time. And this was a great example of it didn't.  

事实上，人们会来这个播客，分享各种事情进展顺利的故事。而这是一个很好的例子，但事实并非如此。

I'm curious if there's another story of let's say a crisis that you all went through when things were looking pretty bleak for Notion along the journey of building Notion.  

我很好奇，在构建 Notion 的过程中，当 Notion 的前景看起来相当暗淡时，你们是否经历过另一个故事，比如说一场危机。

Yeah, one of the bleakest one, it's when we... During COVID, we just couldn't scale up our infrastructure. For the longest time, Simon's really good at don't do premature optimization, so for the longest time, we Notion runs on one instance of Postgres database. And then we find the beefiest machine.  

是的，最惨淡的一次是当我们……在 COVID 期间，我们无法扩大我们的基础设施。长期以来，Simon 非常擅长不进行过早优化，因此长期以来，我们的 Notion 都在 Postgres 数据库的一个实例上运行。然后我们找到了最强大的机器。

We keep scrolling, find a beefier future machine to scale our user base, but then we're running off even the largest instance there is for Postgres. So there's a doomsday clock that when we're going to truly run out of this space to store everything in Notion and Notion got a complete shutdown.  

我们不断滚动，寻找更强大的未来机器来扩展我们的用户群，但随后我们甚至运行了 Postgres 最大的实例。因此，有一个世界末日时钟，当我们真正用完这个空间来存储 Notion 中的所有内容时，Notion 就会完全关闭。

So we stopped building any new features, all hands on deck, almost every engineer in the company trying to solve that problem. Eventually we did, but it was a close call.  

于是我们停止开发任何新功能，全员上阵，公司里几乎每个工程师都试图解决这个问题。最终我们成功了，但非常惊险。

How close are we talking about?  

我们谈论的距离有多近？

If I recall correctly, probably in weeks running out of the time. And then as you approach the limit of what Postgres can do, behavior becomes sporadic. You really don't know which day going to hit you. But we just need to go as fast as you can to become sharding problem.  

如果我没记错的话，可能要花几周时间才能解决。然后，当你接近 Postgres 所能做的极限时，行为就会变得零散。你真的不知道哪一天会来找你麻烦。但我们只需要尽可能快地解决分片问题。

Yeah, I was going to ask, so the solution is sharding the database?  

是的，我正要问，那么解决方案就是对数据库进行分片吗？

Don't do as late. Yes. Don't do premature optimization but plan ahead a little bit. Don't go late.  

不要太晚。是的。不要过早优化，而要提前计划。不要太晚。

How long did you have from when you launched this doomsday clock to time running out? Was that a few months?  

从启动这台末日时钟到时间耗尽，一共过了多久？是几个月吗？

Maybe a bit longer. Yeah, in the month, less than six but more than three, something like that.  

可能稍微长一点。是的，一个月内，少于六个月但多于三个月，大概是这样的。

The bittersweetness of COVID just ramping up certain businesses.  

新冠疫情的苦乐参半只会促进某些业务的发展。

People just run like they have to use online productivity software, collaboration tools.  

人们就像必须使用在线生产力软件和协作工具一样。

Yeah, blessing and a curse. Speaking of a blessing and curse, this is a great segue to where I wanted to go in the final area I want to spend time on which is building horizontal software and building software that bundles together a bunch of different stuff.  

是的，有福也有祸。说到福与祸，这是一个很好的过渡，我想进入最后一个领域，那就是开发横向软件和开发将各种不同的东西捆绑在一起的软件。

Notoriously hard to build a horizontal platform that does a lot of things when there are often point solutions that are very, very good at that one thing. And it's interesting. If you look at the timelines of companies that have built horizontal products, they all take a long time to build and finally find product market fits.  

众所周知，建立一个可以做很多事情的横向平台非常困难，因为通常有非常擅长某一方面解决方案的点解决方案。这很有趣。如果你看看那些已经开发横向产品的公司的时间表，你会发现它们都花了很长时间来开发，并最终找到适合市场的产品。

It's actually a really common pattern. And when we were talking about what would be fun to talk about, the way you described it is the joy and pain of building horizontal products. So let me just ask broadly just what have you learned about what it takes to successfully build a horizontal platform type of product?  

这其实是一种很常见的模式。当我们谈论有趣的话题时，你描述的是构建横向产品的喜悦和痛苦。那么，让我大致问一下，你对成功构建横向平台型产品有何了解？

First of all, no regret. And second, I wouldn't want to build anything else because going back to the value, Lego for software doesn't exist and Lego is a horizontal thing. So that's the thing we want to build. We always want to do that. So we did not start to optimize for business but we're optimized for that vision.  

首先，我并不后悔。其次，我不想再做其他事情了，因为回到价值上，软件版的乐高并不存在，乐高是横向的东西。所以这就是我们想要打造的东西。我们一直都想这么做。所以我们一开始并没有针对业务进行优化，而是针对这一愿景进行了优化。

Learning-wise, I think segmentation is quite important because people can use a Lego for different things. Only hardcore Lego fans care about Lego bricks. Most people care about Lego boxes. And they actually want the Lego box to be ready-made. When you unpack the box, the set is there for you, right?  

从学习角度来看，我认为细分非常重要，因为人们可以将乐高用于不同用途。只有铁杆乐高迷才会关心乐高积木。大多数人关心的是乐高盒子。他们实际上希望乐高盒子是现成的。当你打开盒子时，套装就在你身边，对吧？

That's what we're learning a lot, especially move up market. There's this term that took me a while to learn. It's called solutions. You need to be a solution for enterprise customer, you need to sit somewhere on a P&L to optimize for their business where due third risk. That's Lego box. It's not a Lego brick.  

这正是我们学到的东西，尤其是高端市场。我花了一段时间才学会一个术语。它叫做解决方案。你需要成为企业客户的解决方案，你需要在损益表中的某个位置优化他们的业务，因为存在第三个风险。那是乐高盒子。它不是乐高积木。

Segmentation related to that. So you need to shift your mindset as you more towards B2B, more towards move out market. I wish we have done earlier. For the longest time, I've stalled too much in the Lego brick mindset, now in the solution Lego box mindset.  

细分与此相关。因此，你需要转变思维方式，更多地转向 B2B，更多地转向外向型市场。我希望我们早点这样做。很长一段时间以来，我都停留在乐高积木思维模式中，现在则停留在解决方案乐高盒思维模式中。

That's such a good metaphor. I feel like even if you're not building Legos for business, just this idea of what is the box that you are selling to people, how's it being positioned? How do you picture it? What are the value? Props such a good metaphor.  

这是一个很好的比喻。我觉得，即使你不是为了商业目的而建造乐高积木，你也要考虑你卖给人们的盒子是什么，它是如何定位的？你如何描绘它？它的价值是什么？道具是一个很好的比喻。

If you're building vertical software and naturally your vertical is the box, right? So you know you have 1 or 2% of your selling to. Pretty straightforward that your market constrains you and no judgment. People like you, you can go that way, but then you just hit the wall off the market.  

如果你在开发垂直软件，那么你的垂直领域自然就是盒子，对吧？所以你知道你的销售额只有 1% 或 2%。很简单，你的市场会限制你，而且不会对你做出判断。像你这样的人，你可以走这条路，但你最终会撞上市场的壁垒。

The advantage of building horizontal, there's no wall, at least for in our space. We, Notion, go after entire software market, but then you need to create a wall yourself. So to make your go-to-market distribution, to create the spot in people's mind, your customer's mind more clearly for them and for your go-to-market teams.  

横向构建的优势在于，至少在我们的领域没有墙。我们 Notion 追求整个软件市场，但你需要自己建造一堵墙。因此，为了使你的市场分销更加清晰，你需要在人们的脑海中、你的客户心中为他们和你的市场营销团队创造一个位置。

That's why where solutions is one of my favorite word internally to rally the sales team or the product team. You think that way, but then you need to hold in your head, make sure you're still building bricks behind the scene. Otherwise, you pigeonhole yourself into the best spot, like what we did with project management sprints features.  

这就是为什么“解决方案”是我在内部最喜欢用的一个词，用来团结销售团队或产品团队。你可以这样想，但你需要保持头脑清醒，确保你仍然在幕后努力工作。否则，你就会把自己局限在最佳位置，就像我们在项目管理冲刺功能中所做的那样。

So speaking of that, so I don't know if you know this. I ran a survey recently where I asked my readers what tools they use most, what tools they love most. And it went out to my entire subscriber base. We've got 6,500 people filling out the survey.  

说到这个，我不知道你是否知道。我最近做了一个调查，询问我的读者他们最常用什么工具，他们最喜欢什么工具。这个调查发给了我所有的订阅者。我们有 6,500 人填写了调查问卷。

And Notion more than any other company placed very highly in many categories. For example, I have the notes here, it was the second most popular project management tool after Jira. It was the fourth most popular docs. Which is interesting because you think Notion would... Notion is known for docs and it's interesting, that was the lowest one actually.  

Notion 在许多类别中排名都高于其他任何公司。例如，我这里有笔记，它是继 Jira 之后第二受欢迎的项目管理工具。它是第四受欢迎的文档。这很有趣，因为你认为 Notion 会……Notion 以文档而闻名，有趣的是，它实际上是排名最低的。

And then it was third in CRM, just behind Salesforce and HubSpot.  

然后它在 CRM 领域排名第三，仅次于 Salesforce 和 HubSpot。

Yeah, we did not intend to build CRM, but what is a CRM is relational database. That's why we give people that brick. That's a relational database and they can build CRM themselves. I think the good advantage is if a customer use Notion, they can address those three, four use cases in one place.  

是的，我们本来不打算构建 CRM，但 CRM 就是关系数据库。这就是我们为人们提供这种基础的原因。这是一个关系数据库，他们可以自己构建 CRM。我认为一个好的优势是，如果客户使用 Notion，他们可以在一个地方解决这三、四个用例。

Especially for our startup mid-market companies, their need for each of the vertical use case is not as complex so they can have all the information in one place, good for their teams, good for AI actually. That's a huge market change that's like we did not expect until recently.  

尤其是对于我们初创的中型企业来说，他们对每个垂直用例的需求并不那么复杂，因此他们可以将所有信息集中在一个地方，这对他们的团队有利，实际上对人工智能也有好处。这是一个巨大的市场变化，直到最近我们才预料到。

And save their costs, which is more and more people care about the bundling purchase nowadays. And our approach for that is, yes, we're number two in project management, number what? Number four in CRM, but we're interested in more bricks to make us number... Move up the categories in ranking. So it just takes time, but that's our approach.  

并节省成本，现在越来越多的人关心捆绑购买。我们的方法是，是的，我们在项目管理方面排名第二，那么排名呢？在 CRM 方面排名第四，但我们对更多砖块感兴趣，以便让我们成为第一……提升排名类别。所以这需要时间，但这就是我们的方法。

Yeah. Well, it's working whatever you're doing there. So say someone is trying to build a horizontal tool like yours. There's a lot of founders that are trying to build something that can do a lot of things really well. Do you have any advice for that first use case?  

是的。好吧，无论你在那里做什么，它都能正常工作。假设有人试图构建像你这样的横向工具。有很多创始人都在尝试构建可以很好地完成很多事情的东西。你对第一个用例有什么建议吗？

Just figuring out something that initially works like you're talking about segmentation, is there something there of like, "Do this if you want to find any success with a horizontal tool"?  

只是弄清楚最初的工作原理，就像您在谈论分割一样，是否存在类似“如果您想使用水平工具取得成功，请执行此操作”之类的内容？

First, I wouldn't recommend it.  

首先，我不推荐它。

But you wouldn't do it differently?  

但你不会以不同的方式去做吗？

I wouldn't do it differently myself, but I wouldn't recommend it. It's a problem. The problem space too large to have best practice, but I can share something that's relevant for us. Notion, we always want to build a meta tool, a tool to build the lack of our software.  

我自己不会做不同的事情，但我不推荐这样做。这是一个问题。问题空间太大，没有最佳实践，但我可以分享一些与我们相关的东西。Notion，我们一直想构建一个元工具，一个构建我们软件所缺乏的工具。

We somehow stand up upon document notes as one use case. And that just gave us a large top of the funnel that there's a 1 billion plus people use this use case every day. So that fuels our growth. We call our internal strategy called B2C2B.  

我们以某种方式将文档注释作为一个用例。这给了我们一个巨大的漏斗顶端，每天有超过 10 亿人使用这个用例。这推动了我们的增长。我们将我们的内部战略称为 B2C2B。

All those consumers, personal user use Notion for the most simple way you can use a computer or your phone, which is note-taking or document-sharing. And then they realize, "Oh, Notion can do more of that." There's relational database power, you can do tasks, you can manage track other things. Then they bring Notion to work.  

所有这些消费者、个人用户都以最简单的方式使用 Notion，就像使用电脑或手机一样，即记笔记或共享文档。然后他们意识到，“哦，Notion 可以做更多的事情。”它具有关系数据库功能，你可以执行任务，可以管理跟踪其他事情。然后他们开始使用 Notion。

Half our B2B customers coming from prior personal users, and most of them are using Notion for notes and talk in the first place. So pick.  

我们一半的 B2B 客户来自之前的个人用户，他们中的大多数人最初都是使用 Notion 进行笔记和交谈。所以选择吧。

Well, at least we stumble upon a use case, a horizontal use case to give us a large top of funnel that help us grow our more verticalized enterprise use cases, and that's the reason where we ship a calendar product last year because which other category of software has 1 billion plus users?  

好吧，至少我们偶然发现了一个用例，一个水平用例，它为我们提供了一个巨大的漏斗顶部，帮助我们发展更垂直化的企业用例，这就是我们去年推出日历产品的原因，因为还有哪个类别的软件拥有超过 10 亿用户？

There's document notes, there's calendar, there's email, right? That's why we're also working on the email product right now.  

有文档笔记、日历、电子邮件，对吧？这就是我们现在也在开发电子邮件产品的原因。

Yeah, man. Watch out, everyone. And then you mentioned AI and it's such a good point that AI is best when it has data. And the fact that you have all of this stuff already in there gives you a lot of really interesting opportunities to leverage AI.  

是的，伙计。大家要当心了。然后你提到了人工智能，这是一个很好的观点，即人工智能在有数据的情况下表现最佳。事实上，你已经拥有了所有这些东西，这为你提供了许多真正有趣的机会来利用人工智能。

We definitely did not expect language model. It's such a gift for everybody building tools, right? Complete change the material you can work with. One realization, it's you have a surface area that people spend daily work with, especially during writing and managing your tasks and project. It's really easy to slice the language model writing AI capability into it.  

我们绝对没有想到语言模型。对于所有构建工具的人来说，这都是一份礼物，对吧？彻底改变你可以使用的材料。一个认识是，你有一个人们每天工作的表面区域，特别是在编写和管理你的任务和项目时。将语言模型编写 AI 功能切入其中真的很容易。

So that's the first part we built. That realization is AI is so good at reasoning and understanding and searching things, and we can do a much better job of finding and searching things if all the information are together. That's what we realized. AI is really good with bundled offerings. AI is really good with horizontal tools.  

这就是我们构建的第一部分。这种认识是，人工智能非常擅长推理、理解和搜索事物，如果所有信息都放在一起，我们可以更好地查找和搜索事物。这就是我们所意识到的。人工智能在捆绑产品方面确实很出色。人工智能在横向工具方面确实很出色。

So that's the second phase, we call it. The first product was our AI writer product. Second product is AI Q&A or connectors. Please look at all the information in Notion and give your answer.  

这就是我们所说的第二阶段。第一个产品是我们的 AI 作家产品。第二个产品是 AI 问答或连接器。请查看 Notion 中的所有信息并给出您的答案。

And then we also need to work with the external connector because there's things that are living in Jira, living in Zendesk that other customers still rely on. So we need to build AI connectors. But more and more information coming back to the Notion core.  

然后我们还需要使用外部连接器，因为有些东西存在于 Jira 和 Zendesk 中，而其他客户仍然依赖它们。所以我们需要构建 AI 连接器。但越来越多的信息回到了 Notion 核心。

I would say the third one, which is even more fascinating, it's for the longest time and it's still is one of the biggest weaknesses of building for Legos, it's hard to piece together. It's not everybody can put together a Lego set from scratch. There's always the builders and user with the Legos.  

我想说的是第三个，它更加令人着迷，它长期以来一直是乐高积木的最大弱点之一，而且现在仍然是，它很难拼凑在一起。并不是每个人都能从零开始拼凑一套乐高积木。乐高积木总是有建造者和使用者。

But guess who is really good at piecing things together, assemble things? Especially things like since Sona 3.5. AI is so bad at writing code. Coding is just assembling things together. So now we're looking at holy shit, we spent the last five, six year building all those Lego blocks for knowledge work.  

但你猜谁真的擅长拼凑东西、组装东西？尤其是像 Sona 3.5 这样的。人工智能在编写代码方面非常糟糕。编码只是将东西组装在一起。所以现在我们看到的是，我们花了五六年的时间建造了所有这些用于知识工作的乐高积木。

If we're just putting AI coding agent on top of it, you can create any kind of knowledge, customer software, customer agent for whatever your vertical use cases you need. So that's the most fascinating approach for me, and we did not expect this at all.  

如果我们只是将 AI 编码代理放在其上，您就可以创建任何类型的知识、客户软件、客户代理，以满足您需要的任何垂直用例。所以这对我来说是最有趣的方法，我们根本没有想到这一点。

Thank you, AI. Is there anything else along the lines of building horizontal products and bundling that you think is interesting to share or important? Otherwise, I have one last question I want to ask you.  

谢谢，AI。在构建横向产品和捆绑方面，您认为还有什么值得分享或重要的事情吗？除此之外，我还有最后一个问题想问您。

I think market is like waves. There's... Who said this? There's two-way to build business, bundling and bundling, right? There's too much of a zig and the zag. Actually, my favorite version of this is there's a classic Chinese literature called Romance of Three Kingdoms. It's great novel.  

我认为市场就像波浪。这是谁说的？建立业务有两种方式，捆绑和捆绑，对吗？曲折太多了。实际上，我最喜欢的版本是一部中国古典文学作品，名为《三国演义》。这是一部很棒的小说。

It talked about the three kingdom era of China and the opening sentence of this novel, it's, "Empires long united must divide, long divided must unite." That has always been bundling, unbundling. It's one of my favorite book to read when I was a kid, but business works same way. When there's too much, you can see this.  

书中讲述了中国三国时期的故事，小说的开篇就是“帝国久合必分，久分必合”。这一直都是捆绑和解绑。这是我小时候最喜欢读的书之一，但商业运作也是如此。当事情太多时，你就会看到这一点。

It's like before computers, everything works on paper. Our knowledge work are done through papers is fully democratized medium. Then PC happens during the '80s. The first era is a piece there actually are so many applications. There's early database software, dBASE, it's quite famous. It started dBASE 2 because it gives them credibility.  

就像在计算机出现之前，一切都在纸上进行。我们的知识工作是通过纸张完成的，纸张是一种完全民主化的媒介。然后是 80 年代的 PC。第一个时代实际上有很多应用程序。有早期的数据库软件 dBASE，它相当有名。它启动了 dBASE 2，因为它赋予了它们可信度。

Oh, they have been stick around for some time. So that's the first unbundling phase of software computing. Then Microsoft bundled everything back into one suite in the '90s. Then the SaaS unbundled it. Now, we're at the tail end of SaaS. There's so many verticalized SaaS average company to use almost a hundred tools. It's madness.  

哦，他们已经坚持了一段时间了。所以这是软件计算的第一个拆分阶段。然后微软在 90 年代把所有东西都重新打包成一个套件。然后 SaaS 又把它拆分了。现在，我们处于 SaaS 的尾声。有这么多垂直化的 SaaS 公司平均使用近 100 种工具。这太疯狂了。

So there's more the market shifting towards more a bundling approach. And with AI and with the macro, so there's more value to be created through bundling, at least for now. The market could shift again.  

因此，市场正在更多地转向捆绑销售方式。借助人工智能和宏观经济，捆绑销售可以创造更多价值，至少目前如此。市场可能会再次转变。

So understand this trend, I think, helpful to see should you build a vertical solution or should you build horizontal solution because it does different things.  

因此，我认为，了解这一趋势有助于了解您是否应该构建垂直解决方案或应该构建水平解决方案，因为它的作用不同。

I love that story. Okay, so last question. Something that one of your early investors, Finn Barnes, suggested to ask you. I'm curious where this goes. There's this, and you've touched on this a number of times, just the way you think about Notion, it's almost like a philosophy of how to work and be versus just a productivity tool.  

我喜欢这个故事。好的，最后一个问题。这是你的一位早期投资者 Finn Barnes 建议问你的。我很好奇这个问题会如何发展。有一点，你已经多次提到过，你对 Notion 的看法是，它几乎就像是一种工作哲学，而不仅仅是一种生产力工具。

And so I'm just curious how you think about the relationship between tools and human potential and humans and how we live in the world.  

所以我很好奇你如何看待工具与人类潜力以及人类与我们如何生活在这个世界之间的关系。

The tools are extensions of us. That's why our office room named as timeless tools. They extend us a little bit. And once they extend us, once we shape them, once we bring them to world, they can come back to shape us. One of my favorite quotes like the Marshall MacLean quotes, "We shape our tools.  

工具是我们的延伸。这就是为什么我们的办公室被称为永恒工具。它们会延伸我们一点点。一旦它们延伸了我们，一旦我们塑造了它们，一旦我们将它们带到这个世界，它们就会回来塑造我们。我最喜欢的一句话，比如马歇尔·麦克莱恩的名言，“我们塑造我们的工具。”

Then after, our tools shape us." I think that's probably too philosophical for building product or business, but there is a sense thinking what are you bringing to the world that will come back to bite you or shape you?  

然后，我们的工具塑造了我们。”我认为这对于构建产品或业务来说可能太过哲学，但有一种道理，那就是思考你给这个世界带来了什么，它会反过来伤害你或塑造你？

And are you extending the part, the so-called good part of human nature, or are you extending the part that might be more zero-sum, might be more negative, right? For me, what is Legos? Lego is creativity. Lego is beauty. Software to me feels like lacking both. It's definitely lacking a lot of creativity. It's so rigid.  

你是在延伸人性中所谓的善良部分，还是延伸了可能更具零和性、更具负面影响的部分，对吧？对我来说，乐高是什么？乐高就是创造力。乐高就是美。而软件对我来说，两者似乎都缺乏。它肯定缺乏很多创造力。它太死板了。

So I believe both are human nature that worth amplifying. You can build another business that amplifies a different part of human nature. There was Sequoia famously invests in seven sins or seven human natures of human because they're so powerful if you just latch onto them, you can create a business, you can create a product.  

所以我相信两者都是值得放大的人性。你可以建立另一个放大人性不同部分的企业。红杉资本曾投资于人类的七宗罪或七种人性，因为它们非常强大，如果你抓住它们，你就可以创建一个企业，你可以创造一个产品。

But at least I prefer to amplify creativity and beauty in the domain of software. To me, that's aligned with my values and I think can at least shape the market, shape our user of our product towards the better part of themself.  

但至少我更愿意在软件领域扩大创造力和美感。对我来说，这符合我的价值观，我认为至少可以塑造市场，塑造我们产品的用户，让他们变得更好。

It must feel so good to have a product that is so aligned with the way you want to see the world and actually working and growing at this rate and scaling and becoming this, I don't know, part of the ether of the world.  

拥有一款与你看待世界的方式如此契合的产品，并且以这样的速度运行和增长，不断扩大规模，成为这个世界的一部分，这种感觉一定很棒。

It feels good. Yeah, it feels good that some of the most heartwarming thing is still it never gets old when you walk by coffee shop and see people using Notion. Oh, it feels good.  

感觉很好。是的，感觉很好，当你走过咖啡店看到人们使用 Notion 时，最令人心旷神怡的事情仍然永远不会过时。哦，感觉很好。

And it feels good that we see people in our community can create a living selling Notion template, Notion apps, that they're not a software engineer. And going back to the original mission of when people create software, I think that's one of the most fulfilling thing, at least as a maker of tools can experience.  

我们很高兴看到社区中的人们可以通过销售 Notion 模板和 Notion 应用程序谋生，尽管他们不是软件工程师。回到人们创建软件的最初使命，我认为这是最有成就感的事情之一，至少作为工具制造者可以体验到。

That last point, I think people don't realize, so people are making millions of dollars selling Notion templates on the internet like at Etsy and other places.  

我认为人们没有意识到最后一点，所以人们通过在 Etsy 和其他地方等互联网上销售 Notion 模板赚取了数百万美元。

Consulting templates, yeah, and they're not programmers. I think I would say that's the heart of that because their domain expertise, they're YouTubers or creators. They have lifestyle brand. They know certain things but they're not makers of software. Then they can use Notion, package their workflows and expertise into Notion and templates and make limit with it.  

是的，咨询模板，他们不是程序员。我想说这就是核心，因为他们是领域专家，他们是 YouTuber 或创作者。他们有生活方式品牌。他们知道某些事情，但他们不是软件制造商。然后他们可以使用 Notion，将他们的工作流程和专业知识打包到 Notion 和模板中，并用它来限制。

It's awesome, all that.  这一切都太棒了。

Yeah, millions of dollars is it's crazy. Ivan, before we get to an abridged lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you wanted to touch on think might be useful for folks to hear before we get to a very exciting lightning round.  

是的，数百万美元，这太疯狂了。伊万，在我们进入简短的闪电回合之前，我很好奇，在我们进入非常激动人心的闪电回合之前，您是否还有其他想谈的话题，认为可能对大家有用。

I think people in tech, I wish more people look beyond tech to steal good ideas. It's like Tech Hacker News Twitter are so focused on the now and what's in front of it, what happened six months ago, versus humanity. If you just read books in other industry, you can look sideways.  

我认为科技界人士，我希望更多的人能超越技术来窃取好的想法。就像 Tech Hacker News Twitter 一样，他们太关注现在和眼前的事情，关注六个月前发生的事情，而不是人性。如果你只读其他行业的书籍，你就可以侧视。

If you go back to history, there's a massive amount of patterns and shapes and trade-offs you can steal from and you can make what's in front of you much more interesting. You could give you... People figure out clever patterns in whatever domain in the past. You can just take in front of you.  

如果你回顾历史，你会发现有大量的模式、形状和权衡可以借鉴，你可以让你眼前的事物变得更加有趣。你可以给你……人们在过去的任何领域都发现了巧妙的模式。你可以直接拿来放在你面前。

And I wish more people do that. I think it would be a very interesting way for product makers, business maker to solve the problem in front of them by stealing outside of from the domain of tech and business. So at least it's very inspiring, very useful for me personally.  

我希望更多人这样做。我认为对于产品制造商和企业制造商来说，通过窃取技术和商业领域之外的东西来解决他们面临的问题是一种非常有趣的方式。所以至少对我个人来说，这非常鼓舞人心，非常有用。

It makes me think of the quote, "Good artist copy. Great artists steal."  

这让我想起了那句名言：“好的艺术家抄袭，伟大的艺术家窃取。”

Great artists steal, yeah. Well, Steve Jobs stole that from Picasso or something who stole from former artist probably.  

伟大的艺术家偷窃，是的。好吧，史蒂夫·乔布斯从毕加索那里偷了东西，或者可能是从前任艺术家那里偷了东西。

Well, this is actually an amazing segue to our very abridged lightning round. And the first question is... And by the way, welcome to the lightning round.  

好吧，这实际上是我们非常简短的闪电回合的一个很棒的过渡。第一个问题是……顺便说一句，欢迎来到闪电回合。

The first question is just what are a couple of books that you find yourself recommending most to other people? Could be along the lines of what you just described or could just be generally.  

第一个问题是，您最常向别人推荐的几本书是什么？可能是您刚才描述的那种，也可能只是一般情况。

I think the domain that are interesting the most is the complex system domain. You can look up the term. I think more and more people talk about this, but thinking a system, complex system when all the different things merge together, it creates emergent properties. Talking about ants, talk about beads, talk about life itself.  

我认为最有趣的领域是复杂系统领域。你可以查找这个术语。我认为越来越多的人谈论这个，但思考一个系统，复杂系统，当所有不同的东西融合在一起时，它会产生涌现的属性。谈论蚂蚁，谈论珠子，谈论生命本身。

It's just so fascinating how do with few primitives, few Lego bricks, you can create a thing called life. That thing just, it's sugar for me. So I love reading in that domain.  

用一些基本元素、几块乐高积木就能创造出一种叫做生命的东西，这真是太神奇了。对我来说，那东西就是糖。所以我喜欢阅读这个领域的书籍。

And this is really helpful for create product, at least a horizontal product because you're trying to channel the energy, smaller parts to create something that the sum is much larger than its parts.  

这对于创造产品（至少是水平产品）非常有帮助，因为您试图引导能量，将较小的部分组合起来，创造出总和远大于各部分的东西。

Is there a specific book that comes to mind or is it just generally that's a cool area?  

有没有哪本特定的书让你想起来了，或者只是一般来说那是一个很酷的领域？

That's a cool area to your attention to.  

这是一个值得您关注的很酷的区域。

Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?  

下一个问题。您最近有没有特别喜欢的电影或电视节目？

I like to watch old documentaries. Maybe this is another area or category too. There's quite a few on YouTube. People make really good documentary in the '80s, in the '70s. That's like all the old BBC ones, they're just excellent and they have a strong opinion in them. It's no longer just general education thing. They have a direction.  

我喜欢看老纪录片。也许这也是另一个领域或类别。YouTube 上有很多。人们在 80 年代和 70 年代制作了非常好的纪录片。就像所有旧的 BBC 纪录片一样，它们非常出色，并且带有强烈的个人观点。它不再只是一般教育的东西。它们有自己的方向。

They have a taste. Go look it up. Oh, yeah. One is a really good one to get started called Connections. I think it's called but the gentleman's name is Burke. It's about how different things from different domains inspire other domains, and usually he used 30 minutes or 60 minutes to chain together a bunch of connection of stories.  

他们很有品味。去看看吧。哦，是的。其中一本是一本非常好的入门书，叫做《联系》。我想它的名字是这样的，但这位先生的名字是伯克。它讲述了不同领域的不同事物如何启发其他领域，通常他用 30 分钟或 60 分钟将一系列故事串联起来。

It's really good for technologists to watch. Highly recommend.  

这对技术人员来说真的很有价值。强烈推荐。

I feel a very consistent pattern throughout all of these answers and your entire conversation of just emerging properties, connections, Legos, building abstractions.  

我感觉所有这些答案以及你关于新兴属性、连接、乐高积木、建筑抽象的整个对话中都有一个非常一致的模式。

Yeah, I think I did Enneagram. My Enneagram, it's 7 and 7. 7 is, it is actually perfect with what we just talking about. 7 is creative, finding connection, see the forest and tree. 8 is they call Challenger. It's like competitive AR optimizing. So true energy accessing me.  

是的，我想我做过九型人格测试。我的九型人格是 7 和 7。7 实际上与我们刚才谈论的完全吻合。7 代表创造力，寻找联系，看到森林和树木。8 是他们所说的挑战者。这就像竞争性 AR 优化。所以真正的能量进入我体内。

Oh, wow. It's all makes sense. I got to take this Enneagram. This comes up a bunch on this podcast.  

哦，哇。一切都说得通。我得参加九型人格测试。这个播客上经常出现这种问题。

Final question. Do you have a life motto that you often think back to, that you often repeat in your head of just like when times are hard or just to keep going with something you're working on that you find useful?  

最后一个问题。你是否有一句人生格言，你经常回想起它，当你遇到困难时，或者当你继续做你认为有用的事情时，你经常在脑海里重复这句话？

I like to think things as a craft. You just make it better. Make for yourself. If it's unique enough for yourself and useful for others, things will follow.  

我喜欢把事物看作是一门手艺。你只需要让它变得更好。为自己而做。如果它对你来说足够独特，对别人有用，事情就会水到渠成。

Ivan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, working folks find you online if they want to follow-up on anything, and then how can listeners be useful to you?  

伊万，非常感谢您来到这里。最后两个问题，上班族如果想跟进任何事情，可以在网上找到您，那么听众对您有什么用呢？

Probably find on me on Twitter, Ivan Z-H-A-O. It's helpful give us feedback about Notion, about our product. That's the best help.  

可能在 Twitter 上找到我，Ivan ZHAO。给我们关于 Notion 和我们产品的反馈很有帮助。这是最好的帮助。

What's the best way to do that? Is it like DM, Ivan, or is it-  

最好的办法是什么？是像 DM 那样，Ivan，还是——

Yeah, just DM me.  是的，直接发私信给我即可。

DM me. Yeah, that's probably the best way.  

直接发信息给我。是的，这可能是最好的方法。

Okay. Oh boy, here you go. And then you guys are hiring. Anything specific you're looking for? Anything people should know if they're like, "Oh shit, I want to go work here"?  

好的。哦，天哪，给你。然后你们在招人。你有什么具体要求吗？如果有人说“哦，天哪，我想来这里工作”，他们应该知道什么？

We're trying to hire misfits. So if you think you're a misfit, if you're exceptional at many things especially, you want to build Lego for software, you want to take interesting spin on AI with Lego for software, then DM me.  

我们正在尝试聘用不合群的人。所以如果你认为自己不合群，如果你在许多方面都表现出色，比如你想用软件构建乐高，你想用软件乐高对人工智能进行有趣的改造，那么请直接发信息给我。

Amazing. Ivan, thank you so much for being here.  

太棒了。Ivan，非常感谢你能来到这里。

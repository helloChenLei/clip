A simple formula for a pretty nice life is independence plus purpose.  

美好生活的简单公式就是独立加上目标。

Purpose is different for everyone. Sometimes it’s family, sometimes it’s community, religion, work, whatever.  

每个人的目标都不同。有时是家庭，有时是社区、宗教、工作，等等。

But independence is more universal. Our desire to be independent, why we want it, what prevents us from achieving it, and why some people sabotage their ability to have it, is such a common story across cultures and generations.  

但独立却更为普遍。我们渴望独立，我们为什么想要独立，什么阻碍了我们实现独立，为什么有些人会破坏自己实现独立的能力，这些都是跨文化、跨世代的共同故事。

I have a parenting story.  

我有一个育儿故事。

My son has always been shy. Painfully shy. At times it’s adorable; at times my wife and I worry. Pre-school teachers gave up trying to get him to participate in group activities – he would sit by himself in the corner watching other kids play. He wouldn’t trick-or-treat one year because the thought of knocking on a stranger’s door could bring him to tears. We almost didn’t make it through airport security once because he refused to tell the TSA agent his age (he was eight).  

我儿子一直很害羞。非常害羞。有时这很可爱，有时我和妻子会担心。幼儿园老师不再让他参加集体活动——他会独自坐在角落里看其他孩子玩耍。有一年他不愿意去讨糖果，因为想到要敲陌生人的门，他就会哭。有一次我们差点没能通过机场安检，因为他拒绝告诉 TSA 特工他的年龄（他八岁）。

But we had confidence he’d improve. And like most kids, he has.  

但我们相信他会进步。就像大多数孩子一样，他确实进步了。

Last week we were at a pool and he asked if he could get ice cream. I said yes, but you have to do it by yourself. You have to order it yourself, hand her the money, take the change – all of it. I’m not even going to be nearby.  

上周我们在游泳池边，他问我能不能买冰淇淋。我说可以，但你得自己去买。你必须自己点餐，把钱交给她，找零——所有这一切都得自己做。我甚至都不在附近。

“I can’t do it,” he said.  

“我做不到，”他说。

“That’s OK, you don’t have to” I said.  

我说：“没关系，你不必这么做。”

He paused.  他停顿了一下。

“But can I still get ice cream?”  

“但是我还能吃冰淇淋吗？”

“Yes, but you have to do it yourself,” I said.  

“是的，但你必须自己做，”我说。

Another pause.  又一次停顿。

“What if I get in trouble?” he asked.  

“如果我遇到麻烦怎么办？”他问道。

“For what?”  “为了什么？”

“What if they tell me no because I’m a kid?”  

“如果他们因为我还只是个孩子而拒绝我怎么办？”

“They won’t. But even if they do, it’s fine,” I said. “You won’t be in trouble.”  

“他们不会的。不过就算他们真的这么做了也没关系，”我说，“你不会有麻烦的。”

I could see the gears turning in his head. He wanted to do it so badly.  

我能看出他脑子里在思考着什么。他非常想这么做。

“I don’t know,” he said. “I’m so scared.”  

“我不知道，”他说。“我很害怕。”

Another pause.  又一次停顿。

“I can’t do it.”  “我做不到。”

It’s difficult as a parent to, on one hand, want to shower your kids with protection and help while, on the other, know how important it is to teach them independence. “Teach” is probably the wrong word, because you know they’ll figure it out on their own. Sometimes you provide the most help with the assistance you withhold.  

作为父母，一方面想要给孩子提供保护和帮助，另一方面又知道教会他们独立的重要性，这很困难。“教导”这个词可能不太恰当，因为你知道他们会自己想办法的。有时你提供的帮助越多，你给予的帮助就越多。

My son walked off. I had no idea what he was going to do.  

我儿子走开了。我不知道他要做什么。

A few minutes later he came back – absolutely beaming – with a bowl of ice cream.  

几分钟后，他满脸笑容地回来了，手里拿着一碗冰淇淋。

This story might seem benign to other parents – or even bizarre if you’re used to a gregarious kid. But in the context of his past, it’s hard to describe its impact. He was so proud of himself.  

对于其他家长来说，这个故事可能看起来没什么大不了的，如果你习惯了孩子爱交际，甚至会觉得很奇怪。但考虑到他过去的背景，很难描述它的影响。他对自己非常自豪。

If I had gone with him and held his hand through the process, the ice cream would have given him a small happiness boost. When he did it on his own terms, with a sense of independence, the psychological rewards were off the charts.  

如果我陪着他，牵着他的手，冰淇淋会给他带来一点快乐。当他按照自己的意愿做这件事时，带着一种独立感，心理上的回报是无与伦比的。

I’ll tell you the takeaway: If you’re used to being assisted, supervised, mandated, or dictated, and then suddenly you experience the glory of independence, the feeling is sensational. **Doing something on your own terms can feel better than doing the exact same thing when someone else is peering over your shoulder, telling you what to do, guiding you along**.  

我来告诉你一个要点：如果你习惯于被帮助、监督、命令或指挥，然后突然体验到独立的荣耀，这种感觉真是太棒了。**按照自己的意愿做某事比在别人的监督下做同样的事情感觉更好，别人会告诉你该做什么，指导你怎么做**。

And that’s as true for adults as it is for kids getting ice cream.  

这对于成年人来说是如此，就像对于孩子吃冰淇淋一样。

Independence is the best financial goal for most people. But independence is more than just financial – moral, cultural, and intellectual independence – is one of the highest levels you can reach in life. “There is only one success,” says poet Christopher Morley, “to be able to spend your life in your own way.”  

独立是大多数人最好的财务目标。但独立不仅仅是财务上的独立——道德、文化和智力上的独立——是人生中可以达到的最高水平之一。诗人克里斯托弗·莫利说：“只有一种成功，就是能够以自己的方式度过一生。”

Derek Sivers once put it a different way:  

Derek Sivers 曾经用不同的方式来表达：

> All misery comes from dependency. If you weren’t dependent on income, people, or technology, you would be truly free. The only way to be deeply happy is to break all dependencies.  
> 
> 一切痛苦都源于依赖。如果你不依赖收入、人或技术，你就会真正自由。获得深深幸福的唯一方法就是打破所有依赖。

That’s why independence – financially, intellectually, morally – is one of the highest goals you can achieve.  

这就是为什么独立——经济、智力和道德上的独立——是你可以实现的最高目标之一。

Here are a few things I’ve thought about with independence.  

以下是我对独立的一些思考。

**1\. Independence is the only way to recognize individuality.  

1\. 独立是承认个性的唯一途径。**

I read this great quote recently from an early Amazon employee:  

我最近读到了一位亚马逊早期员工的这句名言：

> Jeff \[Bezos\] said many times that if we wanted Amazon to be a place where builders can build, we needed to eliminate communication, not encourage it.  
> 
> 杰夫（贝佐斯）多次表示，如果我们希望亚马逊成为一个建设者可以建设的地方，我们需要消除沟通，而不是鼓励沟通。

The idea is that if you want to do something great, you cannot have a group of people constantly telling you what you’re doing wrong and why it doesn’t mesh with their own goals. That’s not because those other people might be wrong; it’s because they might be playing a different game than you are.  

这个想法是，如果你想做一件伟大的事情，你就不能让一群人不断地告诉你你做错了什么，以及为什么这与他们自己的目标不符。这并不是因为其他人可能错了；而是因为他们可能在玩一种与你不同的游戏。

In business, finance, and everyday life, a great decision for me might be a terrible decision for you and vice versa. If everyone had the same goals, the same family dynamics, and the same personalities, we could make finance a hard science and say, “Here’s how everyone should save and invest.” But it’s not like that. The difference in how you and I want to live our lives – what our own definition of success might be – can be 10 miles wide. A potato farmer and a hedge fund manager might be equally happy, all while looking at the other as if from a different planet.  

在商业、金融和日常生活中，对我来说一个伟大的决定对你来说可能是一个糟糕的决定，反之亦然。如果每个人都有相同的目标、相同的家庭关系和相同的个性，我们可以把金融变成一门深奥的科学，并说：“每个人都应该这样储蓄和投资。”但事实并非如此。你和我想要的生活方式——我们对成功的定义——之间的差异可能相差 10 英里。一个土豆种植户和一个对冲基金经理可能同样快乐，但他们却把对方看作来自另一个星球的人。

A lot of financial mistakes come from decisions that would be right for someone else but wrong for you. They are the most dangerous, because smart people around you say, “This worked for me. It changed my life. You should do it too.”  

许多财务错误都源于对别人来说是正确的决定，但对你来说却是错误的。这些决定是最危险的，因为你身边的聪明人会说：“这对我有用。它改变了我的生活。你也应该这样做。”

Here’s another thing I read recently, from G. K. Chesterton:  

这是我最近读到的另一篇文章，作者是 GK Chesterton：

> Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas, and moves among them like a lion-tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. The man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine to the head of a teetotaller.  
> 
> 思想是危险的，但思想对最不危险的人是思想家。他熟悉思想，并像驯狮者一样在思想中行动。思想是危险的，但思想对最危险的人是没有思想的人。没有思想的人会发现第一个思想飞进他的脑袋，就像酒飞进禁酒者的脑袋一样。

If you have no strong views on what kind of life you want to live – who are you, what you desire, what makes you happy and what doesn’t – you’re likely to want to mimic the most visually appealing person you come across (often the person with the biggest house, fastest car, or nicest clothes). That may work, it may not.  

如果你对自己想要过什么样的生活没有明确的想法——你是谁，你想要什么，什么让你快乐，什么不让你快乐——你很可能想模仿你遇到的外表最吸引人的人（通常是拥有最大的房子、最快的车或最漂亮的衣服的人）。这可能有效，也可能无效。

And so it’s vital to constantly reflect on who you want to be, what kind of life you want to live, and ask if you’re on an independent path versus chasing someone else’s dream.  

因此，至关重要的是要不断反思自己想成为什么样的人、想过什么样的生活，并扪心自问自己是走一条独立的道路还是在追逐别人的梦想。

**2\. Independence in thought, philosophy, morals, and culture are as important as financial independence.  

2、思想、哲学、道德、文化的独立与经济独立同样重要。**

Charlie Munger once listed three practical rules for success:  

查理·芒格曾经列出三条成功的实用法则：

> -   Don’t sell something you wouldn’t buy.  
>     
>     不要出售你不会买的东西。
>     
> -   Work for people you admire.  
>     
>     为您钦佩的人工作。
>     
> -   Partner with people you enjoy.  
>     
>     与您喜欢的人合作。
>     

So simple.  就这么简单。

I have seen many people achieve some level of financial independence only to be sucked into a new kind of dependence: the culture of their tribe. Financial freedom is achieved, but it’s replaced with sycophancy to a new boss, or a blind adherence to tribal views you might disagree with deep down.  

我见过许多人在实现一定程度的财务独立后，又陷入了新的依赖：他们所属部落的文化。他们实现了财务自由，但取而代之的是向新老板阿谀奉承，或者盲目遵守自己内心深处可能不同意的部落观点。

It’s a unique form of poverty: rather than needing to work for money, you are indebted to needing to think a certain way.  

这是一种独特形式的贫穷：你不需要为钱而工作，而是需要以某种方式思考。

I once heard a good litmus test: If I can predict your views on one topic by hearing your views about another, unrelated topic, you are not thinking independently. Example: If your views on immigration allow someone to accurately predict your views on abortion and gun control, there’s a good chance you’re not thinking independently.  

我曾经听过一个很好的试金石：如果我能通过听取你对另一个不相关话题的看法来预测你对一个话题的看法，那么你就没有独立思考。例如：如果某人能通过你对移民的看法准确地预测你对堕胎和枪支管制的看法，那么你很可能没有独立思考。

There are so many different versions of this: The salesman who doesn’t believe in his products, the worker who secretly thinks her boss is crazy, the employee who can’t stand his highest-paying client, the voter who nods along while wincing inside.  

这种情况有很多种：不相信自己产品的销售员、暗自认为老板疯了的员工、无法忍受付钱最高的客户的员工、点头表示同意但内心却皱着眉头的选民。

There’s a difference between the practical need to accept different views and pretending to agree with different views, especially if you’re just doing it for more money.  

实际需要接受不同观点和假装同意不同观点之间是有区别的，特别是当你只是为了赚更多的钱而这样做的时候。

Investor Ed Thorp once said: “It is vastly less stressful to be independent—and one is never independent when involved in a large structure with powerful clients.”  

投资者艾德·索普 (Ed Thorp) 曾经说过：“独立的压力会小很多，但当你参与一个拥有强大客户的大型组织时，你永远不会独立。”

Less stress is a good point. It’s mentally exhausting to pretend to be someone you’re not. It’s part of why so many people look forward to retirement: it may be the first time in their professional lives they can truly be themselves.  

压力小是好事。假装成别人会让你精神疲惫。这也是为什么这么多人期待退休的原因之一：这可能是他们职业生涯中第一次真正做自己。

Financial independence is easy to grasp – you no longer rely on others for income. Intellectual and moral independence is more nuanced, but not having it is a unique form of debt.  

财务独立很容易实现——你不再依赖他人的收入。智力和道德独立则更加微妙，但没有它就是一种独特的债务形式。

**3\. When you’re independent you feel less desire to impress strangers, which can be an enormous financial and psychological cost.  

3\. 当你独立时，你就不太想给陌生人留下好印象，这可能会给你带来巨大的经济和心理成本。**

Speaking of hidden forms of debts: How much of what takes place in our modern economy is done purely for signaling reasons? It’s impossible to quantify, but you know it when you see it. And taking an action to impress other people is a direct form of dependence. It happens in many different ways:  

说到隐性债务：现代经济中发生的多少事情纯粹是出于信号原因？这无法量化，但当你看到它时你就知道了。采取行动来打动别人是一种直接的依赖形式。它以多种不同的方式发生：

-   **Physical signaling** (clothes, cars, homes, jewelry)  
    
    **物理信号**（衣服、汽车、房屋、珠宝）
    
-   **Clout-chasing** (desperate for social media engagement)  
    
    **追逐影响力**（渴望参与社交媒体）
    
-   **Tribal signaling** (political battles, status superiority, election bumper stickers)  
    
    **部落信号**（政治斗争、地位优越性、选举保险杠贴纸）
    
-   **Moral signaling** (everything is us-versus-them)  
    
    **道德信号**（一切都是我们与他们对抗）
    

Each of these is about measuring your own value through the opinions of others. Sometimes it’s direct (your net worth versus mine) and other times it’s more subtle (do you like me?). The person who is desperate for attention and acceptance from a group of strangers is hardly different from the person begging for money on the street.  

以上每一项都是通过他人的观点来衡量自己的价值。有时是直接的（你的净资产与我的净资产），有时则更为微妙（你喜欢我吗？）。渴望得到一群陌生人的关注和认可的人与在街上乞讨的人几乎没有什么区别。

The wild thing about all this effort is how easy it is to overestimate how much other people are thinking about you. No one is thinking about you as much as you are. They are too busy thinking about themselves.  

所有这些努力最疯狂的地方在于，你很容易高估别人对你的关心程度。没有人像你一样关心你。他们太忙于思考自己了。

Even when people are thinking about you, they often do it just to contextualize their own life. When someone looks at you and thinks, “I like her sweater,” what they actually may be thinking is, “That sweater would look nice on me.” I once called this the man-in-the-car-paradox: When you see someone driving a nice car, rarely do you think, “Wow, that driver is cool.” What you think is, “If I drove that car, people would think I’m cool.” Do you see the irony?  

即使人们在想你，他们也常常只是为了将自己的生活置于背景中。当有人看着你并想着“我喜欢她的毛衣”时，他们实际上可能在想“那件毛衣穿在我身上会很好看”。我曾经把这称为“人与车”悖论：当你看到有人开着一辆漂亮的汽车时，你很少会想“哇，那个司机很酷”。你会想“如果我开那辆车，人们会认为我很酷”。你明白其中的讽刺吗？

When you’re truly independent you rid yourself of this silly burden. It can be such a relief when you do. Only when you stop caring what strangers might think of you do you realize how much effort you may have previously put into their validation.  

当你真正独立时，你就摆脱了这个愚蠢的负担。当你这样做时，你会感到如释重负。只有当你不再关心陌生人会怎么看你时，你才会意识到你之前可能为他们的认可付出了多少努力。

But let me make an equally important point:  

但让我指出一个同样重要的观点：

**4\. Independence does not mean you don’t care what anyone thinks of you. It means that you strategically decide whose attention you seek.  

4\. 独立并不意味着你不在乎别人对你的看法。它意味着你会策略性地决定自己想要吸引谁的注意。**

I need the love and admiration of my wife, kids, and parents. I enjoy the presence and camaraderie of about five friends. I want to foster relationships with a small group of people I admire in my professional orbit.  

我需要妻子、孩子和父母的爱与钦佩。我喜欢五个朋友的陪伴和友谊。我希望与我职业生涯中敬佩的一小群人建立关系。

But you can see how this funnel keeps tapering off from there.  

但你可以看到这个漏斗从那里开始逐渐变细。

When you independently choose who you want to include in your small circle of life, the actions you take, the work you pursue, and even the values you hold can completely flip. Rather than trying to appease everyone (foolish, impossible) you select the life you want to live and focus your attention on a smaller group of people whose love and support you deeply desire.  

当你独立选择将谁纳入你的小圈子时，你采取的行动、你从事的工作，甚至你持有的价值观都可能完全改变。与其试图取悦所有人（愚蠢、不可能），不如选择你想要的生活，将注意力集中在你非常渴望得到爱和支持的一小群人身上。

It’s the opposite of when business leaders and politicians pander for the support of the masses. On one hand you can say they are doing something that gets them what they want (power). On the other, how independent are you if the words you say and the actions you take are dictated by the beliefs of a group of people you’ve never met?  

这与商界领袖和政客迎合大众的支持正好相反。一方面，你可以说他们正在做一些让他们得到想要的东西（权力）。另一方面，如果你说的话和你采取的行动是由一群你从未见过的人的信念决定的，你有多独立？

A related point here is that loyalty to those who deserve your loyalty is a wonderful thing. Family, genuine friends, companies who you deeply respect and admire – it can be so satisfying to offer your loyalty to someone who deserves it. But it’s rare, and only when you’re independent can you be honest about whether you’re being appropriately loyal or attached to the attention and money of people you secretly don’t admire.  

与此相关的一点是，对值得你忠诚的人忠诚是一件美妙的事情。家人、真正的朋友、你深深尊重和钦佩的公司——向值得忠诚的人表达忠诚会让人非常满足。但这种情况很少见，只有当你独立时，你才能诚实地判断自己是否忠诚得当，还是执着于你暗中并不钦佩的人的关注和金钱。

**5\. Financial independence doesn’t mean you stop working**.  

**5.财务独立并不意味着停止工作**。

This idea is related to the previous one: Financial independence is a wonderful goal. But achieving it doesn’t necessarily mean you stop working – just that you choose the work you do, when you do it, for how long, and whom you do it with.  

这个想法与前一个想法相关：财务独立是一个美好的目标。但实现它并不一定意味着你要停止工作——你只是可以选择你做什么工作、何时做、做多长时间以及和谁一起做。

Those who retire early tend to come from one of two camps:  

提前退休的人通常来自以下两个阵营之一：

-   They hated their work but kept doing it to make as much money as they could.  
    
    他们讨厌自己的工作，但为了尽可能多地赚钱，他们仍坚持做下去。
    
-   They enjoyed their work but quit when they had enough money.  
    
    他们热爱自己的工作，但是当他们赚到足够的钱时就辞职了。
    

To each their own, but both look like situations where money controls your decisions. The irony is that some people who think they’re financially independent are actually completely dependent on money, so much so that they spend their days doing things they’d rather not because money tells them they should. Rather than using money as a tool, the money used them.  

每个人都有自己的情况，但这两种情况看起来都像是金钱控制着你的决定。讽刺的是，一些认为自己经济独立的人实际上完全依赖金钱，以至于他们整天做着自己不愿意做的事情，因为金钱告诉他们应该这样做。金钱不是把他们当作工具，而是利用了他们。

**6\. Being independent doesn’t mean you’re accountable to no one. You become accountable to yourself, which is often when you do your best work.  

6\. 独立并不意味着你不用对任何人负责。你得对自己负责，这往往是你工作最出色的时候。**

Study any great creator – scientists, artists, entrepreneurs – and you’ll find an independent drive. They weren’t working to appease a boss or earn a paycheck; they were driven solely by their own curiosity and expectations.  

研究任何伟大的创造者——科学家、艺术家、企业家——你都会发现一种独立的驱动力。他们工作不是为了取悦老板或挣钱；他们完全是出于自己的好奇心和期望。

When you’re working for someone else’s expectations, the path of least resistance is to put in the minimum required effort – or, worse, to give off the appearance of effort while not actually being productive.  

当你为了别人的期望而工作时，阻力最小的路径就是付出最少的努力——或者更糟的是，表面上看起来很努力，但实际上却没有成效。

I think almost everyone is creative. But it’s often hard to dredge up creativity when you’re doing it for someone else. In my profession: Writing for yourself is fun, and it shows. Writing for other people is work, and it shows. You do your best work when you’re doing it on your own terms.  

我认为几乎每个人都有创造力。但当你为别人写作时，往往很难激发创造力。在我的职业中：为自己写作很有趣，而且很明显。为别人写作是工作，而且很明显。当你按照自己的方式写作时，你会做得最好。

I bet that applies to most fields.  

我相信这适用于大多数领域。

And actually most of life.  

事实上，这也是人生的大部分内容。

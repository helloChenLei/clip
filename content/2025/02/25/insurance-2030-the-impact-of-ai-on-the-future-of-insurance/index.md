CM: 看完之后，我突然发现支付宝接入 AI 最好做这件事，医保记录和纳税记录它都有，细想也是一件非常可怕的事情。我自己也过一篇文章：[AI对保险的价值｜ 胡说八道 - 特立独行的异类 By DemoChen](https://demochen.com/posts/20250207/)作为参考。

**Welcome to the future of insurance,** as seen through the eyes of Scott, a customer in the year 2030. His digital personal assistant orders him a a vehicle with self-driving capabilities for a meeting across town. Upon hopping into the arriving car, Scott decides he wants to drive today and moves the car into “active” mode. Scott’s personal assistant maps out a potential route and shares it with his mobility insurer, which immediately responds with an alternate route that has a much lower likelihood of accidents and auto damage as well as the calculated adjustment to his monthly premium. Scott’s assistant notifies him that his mobility insurance premium will increase by 4 to 8 percent based on the route he selects and the volume and distribution of other cars on the road. It also alerts him that his life insurance policy, which is now priced on a “pay-as-you-live” basis, will increase by 2 percent for this quarter. The additional amounts are automatically debited from his bank account.  

**欢迎来到2030年斯科特（Scott）的眼中所见的保险未来。**他的数字私人助理命令他订购AA车辆，具有自动驾驶能力，可以在整个城镇举行会议。跳入到达的汽车后，斯科特决定他今天想开车，并将汽车移至“主动”模式。斯科特（Scott）的私人助理绘制了一条潜在的路线，并与他的出行保险公司分享了一条潜在的路线，该保险公司立即以一条替代路线做出回应，该路线的事故和汽车损坏的可能性要低得多，并且对他的每月溢价进行了计算的调整。斯科特（Scott）的助手通知他，根据他选择的路线以及道路上其他汽车的数量和分配，他的出行保险费将增加4％至8％。它还提醒他，他的人寿保险政策现在以“付款方式”的基础定价，在本季度将增加2％。额外的金额将自动从其银行帐户中扣除。

When Scott pulls into his destination’s parking lot, his car bumps into one of several parking signs. As soon as the car stops moving, its internal diagnostics determine the extent of the damage. His personal assistant instructs him to take three pictures of the front right bumper area and two of the surroundings. By the time Scott gets back to the driver’s seat, the screen on the dash informs him of the damage, confirms the claim has been approved, and reports that a mobile response drone has been dispatched to the lot for inspection. If the vehicle is drivable, it may be directed to the nearest in-network garage for repair after a replacement vehicle arrives.  

当斯科特（Scott）进入目的地的停车场时，他的汽车撞到了几个停车标志之一。一旦汽车停止移动，其内部诊断就决定了损坏的程度。他的私人助理指示他为右前保险杠区域和两个周围环境拍摄三张照片。当斯科特回到驾驶员座位时，破折号的屏幕告诉他损坏，确认索赔已批准，并报告说，移动响应无人机已被派往该地段进行检查。如果车辆可驾驶，则可以将其引导到最近的网络内车库进行维修，以便在替换车辆到达后进行维修。

While this scenario may seem beyond the horizon, such integrated user stories will emerge across all lines of insurance with increasing frequency over the next decade. In fact, all the technologies required above already exist, and many are available to consumers. With the new wave of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks,<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">1</sup> artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to live up to its promise of mimicking the perception, reasoning, learning, and problem solving of the human mind (Exhibit 1). In this evolution, insurance will shift from its current state of “detect and repair” to “predict and prevent,” transforming every aspect of the industry in the process. The pace of change will also accelerate as brokers, consumers, financial intermediaries, insurers, and suppliers become more adept at using advanced technologies to enhance decision making and productivity, lower costs, and optimize the customer experience.  

尽管这种情况似乎超出了地平线，但这种集成的用户故事将在未来十年内随着频率的增加而出现。实际上，上述所有所需的技术已经存在，并且许多技术可用于消费者。随着新浪潮的深度学习技术，例如卷积神经网络， <sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">1</sup>人工智能（AI）有可能辜负其模仿人类思想的看法，推理，学习和解决问题的承诺（图1）。在这种发展中，保险将从其当前的“检测和维修”转变为“预测和预防”，从而改变了行业的各个方面。随着经纪人，消费者，金融中介机构，保险公司和供应商的发展，变革的步伐也将加速，更擅长使用先进的技术来提高决策和生产力，降低成本并优化客户体验。

As AI becomes more deeply integrated in the industry, carriers must position themselves to respond to the changing business landscape. Insurance executives must understand the factors that will contribute to this change and how AI will reshape claims, distribution, and underwriting and pricing. With this understanding, they can start to build the skills and talent, embrace the emerging technologies, and create the culture and perspective needed to be successful players in the insurance industry of the future.  

随着AI在行业中变得更加深入，运营商必须将自己定位为应对不断变化的业务格局。保险高管必须了解将有助于这一变化的因素，以及AI将如何重塑索赔，分配以及承销和定价。有了这种理解，他们可以开始建立技能和才能，拥护新兴技术，并创造成为未来保险行业中成功参与者所需的文化和观点。

## Four AI-related trends shaping insurance  

四个与AI相关的趋势塑造保险

AI’s underlying technologies are already being deployed in our businesses, homes, and vehicles, as well as on our person. The disruption from COVID-19 changed the timelines for the adoption of AI by significantly accelerating digitization for insurers. Virtually overnight, organizations had to adjust to accommodate remote workforces, expand their digital capabilities to support distribution, and upgrade their online channels. While most organizations likely didn't invest heavily in AI during the pandemic, the increased emphasis on digital technologies and a greater willingness to embrace change will put them in a better position to incorporate AI into their operations.  

AI的基本技术已经在我们的业务，房屋和车辆以及我们的人中部署。 COVID-19的中断通过显着加速保险公司的数字化来改变了采用AI的时间表。实际上，一夜之间，组织必须进行调整以适应远程劳动力，扩展其数字功能以支持分销并升级其在线渠道。尽管大多数组织在大流行期间可能没有在AI上进行大量投资，但对数字技术的重视程度越来越大，并且更加愿意接受变革的意愿将使他们更好地将AI纳入其运营中。

Four core technology trends, tightly coupled with (and sometimes enabled by) AI, will reshape the insurance industry over the next decade.  

四个核心技术趋势与AI紧密相结合（有时是由），将在未来十年内重塑保险业。

### Explosion of data from connected devices  

来自连接设备的数据爆炸

In industrial settings, equipment with sensors have been omnipresent for some time, but the coming years will see a huge increase in the number of connected consumer devices. The penetration of existing devices (such as cars, fitness trackers, home assistants, smartphones, and smart watches) will continue to increase rapidly, joined by new, growing categories such as clothing, eyewear, home appliances, medical devices, and shoes. Experts estimate there will be up to one trillion connected devices by 2025.<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">2</sup> The resulting avalanche of new data created by these devices will allow carriers to understand their clients more deeply, resulting in new product categories, more personalized pricing, and increasingly real-time service delivery.  

在工业环境中，带有传感器的设备无处不在，但是接下来的几年将看到连接的消费设备数量大幅增加。现有设备（例如汽车，健身追踪器，家庭助手，智能手机和智能手表）的渗透将继续迅速增加，并由新的，诸如服装，眼镜，家用电器，医疗设备和鞋子等新型类别加入。专家估计，到2025年，将有多达1万亿个连接的设备<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">。2。</sup>这些设备创建的新数据的雪崩将使运营商能够更深入地了解其客户，从而导致新产品类别，更个性化的定价和日益实时的服务交付。

### Increased prevalence of physical robotics  

物理机器人技术的患病率增加

The field of robotics has seen many exciting achievements recently, and this innovation will continue to change how humans interact with the world around them. Additive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing, will radically reshape manufacturing and the commercial insurance products of the future. By 2025, 3-D-printed buildings will be common, and carriers will need to assess how this development changes risk assessments. In addition, programmable, autonomous drones; autonomous farming equipment; and enhanced surgical robots will all be commercially viable in the next decade. By 2030, a much larger proportion of standard vehicles will have autonomous features, such as self-driving capabilities. Carriers will need to understand how the increasing presence of robotics in everyday life and across industries will shift risk pools, change customer expectations, and enable new products and channels.  

机器人技术领域最近取得了许多令人兴奋的成就，这一创新将继续改变人类与周围世界的互动方式。增材制造业（也称为3-D打印）将从根本上重塑制造和未来的商业保险产品。到2025年，3-D打印的建筑物将很普遍，并且运营商将需要评估该开发方式如何改变风险评估。此外，可编程，自动无人机；自动农业设备；在未来十年中，增强的手术机器人将在商业上可行。到2030年，更大比例的标准车辆将具有自主功能，例如自动驾驶功能。运营商将需要了解日常生活和整个行业中机器人技术的增加如何改变风险池，改变客户的期望并启用新产品和渠道。

### Open-source and data ecosystems  

开源和数据生态系统

As data becomes ubiquitous, open-source protocols will emerge to ensure data can be shared and used across industries. Various public and private entities will come together to create ecosystems in order to share data for multiple use cases under a common regulatory and cybersecurity framework. For example, wearable data could be ported directly to insurance carriers, and connected-home and auto data could be made available through Amazon, Apple, Google, and a variety of consumer device manufacturers.  

随着数据变得无处不在，将出现开源协议，以确保可以在行业共享和使用数据。各种公共和私人实体将聚集在一起创建生态系统，以在共同的监管和网络安全框架下共享多种用例的数据。例如，可穿戴数据可以直接移植到保险公司，并且可以通过亚马逊，苹果，Google和各种消费者设备制造商提供连接的房屋和自动数据。

### Advances in cognitive technologies  

认知技术的进步

Convolutional neural networks and other deep learning technologies currently used primarily for image, voice, and unstructured text processing will evolve to be applied in a wide variety of applications. These cognitive technologies, which are loosely based on the human brain’s ability to learn through decomposition and inference, will become the standard approach for processing the incredibly large and complex data streams that will be generated by “active” insurance products tied to an individual’s behavior and activities. With the increased commercialization of these types of technologies, carriers will have access to models that are constantly learning and adapting to the world around them—enabling new product categories and engagement techniques while responding to shifts in underlying risks or behaviors in real time.  

当前主要用于图像，语音和非结构化文本处理的卷积神经网络和其他深度学习技术将演变为应用于多种应用。这些认知技术基于人类大脑通过分解和推理学习的能力而宽松地成为处理可难以置信的大而复杂的数据流的标准方法，这些方法将由“活跃”的保险产品与个人的行为和行为和个人行为和相关的保险产品产生活动。随着这些类型技术的商业化的增加，运营商将可以访问不断学习和适应周围世界的模型，以实现新的产品类别和参与技术，同时实时响应潜在的风险或行为的转变。

## The state of insurance in 2030  

2030年的保险状态

AI and its related technologies will have a seismic impact on all aspects of the insurance industry, from distribution to underwriting and pricing to claims. Advanced technologies and data are already affecting distribution and underwriting, with policies being priced, purchased, and bound in near real time. An in-depth examination at what insurance may look like in 2030 highlights dramatic changes across the insurance value chain.  

AI及其相关技术将对从分销到承销和定价再到索赔的保险行业的各个方面产生地震影响。先进的技术和数据已经在影响分销和承保，并在几乎实时实时定价，购买和束缚。对2030年保险可能的深入检查突出了整个保险价值链中的巨大变化。

### Distribution  分配

[The experience of purchasing insurance is faster](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-insurance-can-prepare-for-the-next-distribution-model), with less active involvement on the part of the insurer and the customer. Enough information is known about individual behavior, with AI algorithms creating risk profiles, so that cycle times for completing the purchase of an auto, commercial, or life policy will be reduced to minutes or even seconds. Auto and home carriers have enabled instant quotes for some time but will continue to refine their ability to issue policies immediately to a wider range of customers as telematics and in-home Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferate and pricing algorithms mature. Many life carriers are experimenting with simplified issue products, but most are restricted to only the healthiest applicants and are priced higher than a comparable fully underwritten product. As AI permeates life underwriting and carriers are able to identify risk in a much more granular and sophisticated way, we will see a new wave of mass-market instant issue products.  

[购买保险的经验更快](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-insurance-can-prepare-for-the-next-distribution-model)，保险公司和客户的积极参与较少。已经知道有关个人行为的足够信息，并具有AI算法创建风险概况，因此完成购买汽车，商业或生命政策的周期时间将减少到几分钟甚至几秒钟。汽车和住房运输商已启用了一段时间的即时报价，但将继续完善其立即向更广泛的客户发布政策的能力，因为远程信息处理和家庭互联网（IoT）设备（IoT）设备扩散且价格成熟。许多生命载体正在尝试简化的问题产品，但大多数仅限于最健康的申请人，并且价格高于可比的完全承保产品。由于AI渗透了生活承销，并且运营商能够以更加细粒度和精致的方式识别风险，因此我们将看到新一波的大众市场即时问题产品。

Smart contracts enabled by blockchain instantaneously authorize payments from a customer’s financial account. Meanwhile, contract processing and payment verification are eliminated or streamlined, reducing customer acquisition costs for insurers. The purchase of commercial insurance is similarly expedited as the combination of drones, IoT, and other available data provides sufficient information for AI-based cognitive models to proactively generate a bindable quote.  

区块链启用的智能合约即时授权从客户的财务帐户付款。同时，取消或简化了合同处理和付款验证，从而降低了保险公司的客户收购成本。购买商业保险的购买也类似地加快了无人机，物联网和其他可用数据的结合，为基于AI的认知模型提供了足够的信息，可以主动生成可约束的报价。

Highly dynamic, usage-based insurance (UBI) products proliferate and are tailored to the behavior of individual consumers. Insurance transitions from a “purchase and annual renewal” model to a continuous cycle, as product offerings constantly adapt to an individual’s behavioral patterns. Furthermore, products are disaggregated substantially into microcoverage elements (for example, phone battery insurance, flight delay insurance, different coverage for a washer and dryer within the home) that consumers can customize to their particular needs, with the ability to instantaneously compare prices from various carriers for their individualized baskets of insurance products. New products emerge to cover the shifting nature of living arrangements and travel. UBI becomes the norm as physical assets are shared across multiple parties, with a pay-by-mile or pay-by-ride model for car sharing and pay-by-stay insurance for home-sharing services, such as Airbnb.<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">3</sup>  

高度动态的，基于用法的保险（UBI）产品扩散，并根据个人消费者的行为量身定制。保险从“购买和年度续订”模型过渡到连续周期，因为产品不断适应个人的行为方式。此外，消费者可以自定义其特定需求，并能够从各种价格上比较价格，从而将产品大量分解为微覆盖元素（例如，电话电池保险，飞行延迟保险，房屋内的洗衣机和烘干机的不同覆盖范围），消费者可以自定义其特定需求，并可以立即比较各种价格的价格其个性化保险产品篮子的运营商。新产品出现，以涵盖生活安排和旅行的变化性质。 UBI成为常态，因为各方在多方共享实体资产，并采用逐英里或逐付的型号，用于汽车共享和乘坐房屋共享服务的付费保险，例如Airbnb。 <sup data-immersive-translate-walked="ae96dc0b-005b-4ad5-a688-26d2be120946">3</sup>

The role of insurance agents has changed dramatically by 2030. The number of agents is reduced substantially as active agents retire and remaining agents rely heavily on technology to increase productivity. The role of agents transitions to process facilitators and product educators. The agent of the future can sell nearly all types of coverage and adds value by helping clients manage their portfolios of coverage across experiences, health, life, mobility, personal property, and residential. Agents use smart personal assistants to optimize their tasks as well as AI-enabled bots to find potential deals for clients. These tools help agents to support a substantially larger client base while making customer interactions (a mix of in-person, virtual, and digital) shorter and more meaningful, given that each interaction will be tailored to the exact current and future needs of each individual client.  

到2030年，保险代理商的作用发生了巨大变化。随着活跃的代理商退休和剩余代理商的严重依赖技术来提高生产率，代理商的数量大大减少。代理商过渡到处理促进者和产品教育者的作用。未来的代理人几乎可以出售所有类型的覆盖范围，并通过帮助客户在体验，健康，生活，流动性，个人财产和住宅中管理其覆盖范围的组合来增加价值。代理商使用智能的个人助理来优化其任务以及支持AI的机器人，以寻找客户的潜在交易。这些工具可帮助代理商支持更大的客户群，同时使客户互动（将面对面，虚拟和数字化的混合）更短，更有意义，鉴于每种互动将根据每个人的确切当前和未来量身定制客户。

### Underwriting and pricing  承保和定价

[In 2030, underwriting as we know it today ceases to exist](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/rewriting-the-rules-digital-and-ai-powered-underwriting-in-life-insurance) for most personal and small-business products across life and property and casualty insurance. The process of underwriting is reduced to a few seconds as the majority of underwriting is automated and supported by a combination of machine and deep learning models built within the technology stack. These models are powered by internal data as well as a broad set of external data accessed through application programming interfaces and outside data and analytics providers. Information collected from devices provided by mainline carriers, reinsurers, product manufacturers, and product distributors is aggregated in a variety of data repositories and data streams. These information sources enable insurers to make ex ante decisions regarding underwriting and pricing, enabling proactive outreach with a bindable quote for a product bundle tailored to the buyer’s risk profile and coverage needs.  

[在2030年，我们今天知道的承销将不再存在](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/rewriting-the-rules-digital-and-ai-powered-underwriting-in-life-insurance)生命，财产以及伤亡保险的大多数个人和小型企业产品。由于大多数承保量是由机器和深度学习模型组合在技术堆栈中建立的，因此承销过程减少到几秒钟。这些模型由内部数据以及通过应用程序编程界面以及外部数据和分析提供商访问的大量外部数据提供动力。从主线运营商，再保险商，产品制造商和产品分销商提供的设备收集的信息汇总了各种数据存储库和数据流。这些信息来源使保险公司能够对承保和定价做出实例决定，从而使积极主动的宣传，并提供可有限的报价，适用于购买者的风险概况和承保范围需求的产品捆绑包。

Regulators review AI-enabled, machine learning–based models, a task that requires a transparent method for determining traceability of a score (similar to the rating factor derivations used today with regression-based coefficients). To verify that data usage is appropriate for marketing and underwriting, regulators assess a combination of model inputs. They also develop test policies for providers when determining rates in online plans to ensure the algorithm results are within approved bounds. Public policy considerations limit access to certain sensitive and predictive data (such as health and genetic information) that would decrease underwriting and pricing flexibility and increase antiselection risk in some segments.  

监管机构审查了基于机器学习的模型，该任务需要一种透明的方法来确定分数的可追溯性（类似于今天使用基于回归的系数的当今使用的评级因子派生）。为了验证数据使用适用于营销和承保，监管机构评估了模型输入的组合。在确定在线计划中的费率时，他们还为提供者制定了测试策略，以确保算法结果在批准的范围内。公共政策的考虑限制了访问某些敏感和预测数据（例如健康和遗传信息），这些数据将降低承保和定价灵活性并增加某些细分市场的反登录风险。

Price remains central in consumer decision making, but carriers innovate to diminish competition purely on price. Sophisticated proprietary platforms connect customers and insurers and offer customers differentiated experiences, features, and value. In some segments, price competition intensifies, and razor-thin margins are the norm, while in other segments, unique insurance offerings enable margin expansion and differentiation. In jurisdictions where change is embraced, the pace of pricing innovation is rapid. Pricing is available in real time based on usage and a dynamic, data-rich assessment of risk, empowering consumers to make decisions about how their actions influence coverage, insurability, and pricing.  

价格在消费者决策中仍然是核心，但是载体纯粹是在价格上降低竞争的创新。精致的专有平台将客户和保险公司连接起来，并为客户提供不同的体验，功能和价值。在某些细分市场中，价格竞争加剧了，剃须刀的利润是常态，而在其他细分市场中，独特的保险产品可以扩大保证金和差异化。在包含变化的司法管辖区，定价创新的步伐迅速。根据用法以及对风险的动态，数据丰富的评估，可以实时获得定价，使消费者有能力就其行为如何影响覆盖范围，保险和定价做出决定。

### Claims  主张

[Claims processing in 2030 remains a primary function of carriers](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/claims-2030-a-talent-strategy-for-the-future-of-insurance-claims), but more than half of claims activities have been replaced by automation. Advanced algorithms handle initial claims routing, increasing efficiency and accuracy.  

[2030年的索赔处理仍然是承运人的主要功能](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/claims-2030-a-talent-strategy-for-the-future-of-insurance-claims)，但是超过一半的索赔活动已被自动化所取代。高级算法处理初始索赔路由，提高效率和准确性。

IoT sensors and an array of data-capture technologies, such as drones, largely replace traditional, manual methods of first notice of loss. Claims triage and repair services are often triggered automatically upon loss. In the case of an auto accident, for example, a policyholder takes streaming video of the damage, which is translated into loss descriptions and estimate amounts. Vehicles with autonomous features that sustain minor damage direct themselves to repair shops for service while another car with autonomous features is dispatched in the interim. In the home, IoT devices will be increasingly used to proactively monitor water levels, temperature, and other key risk factors and will proactively alert both tenants and insurers of issues before they arise.  

物联网传感器和一系列数据捕获技术（例如无人机）在很大程度上取代了传统的手动损失通知。索赔分类和维修服务通常会在损失后自动触发。例如，在发生汽车事故的情况下，保单持有人会采用流媒体视频的损坏视频，该视频被转化为损失描述并估算金额。具有自主功能的车辆，可以维持较小的损坏，直接将自己维修商店进行服务，而另一辆具有自主功能的汽车则在此期间派遣。在家里，物联网设备将越来越多地用于主动监控水位，温度和其他关键危险因素，并会在出现问题之前主动提醒租户和保险公司。

Automated customer service apps handle most policyholder interactions through voice and text, directly following self-learning scripts that interface with the claims, fraud, medical service, policy, and repair systems. The turnaround time for resolution of many claims is measured in minutes rather than days or weeks. Human claims management focuses on a few areas: complex and unusual claims, contested claims where human interaction and negotiation are empowered by analytics and data-driven insights, claims linked to systemic issues and risks created by new technology (for example, hackers infiltrate critical IoT systems), and random manual reviews of claims to ensure sufficient oversight of algorithmic decision making.  

自动化客户服务应用程序通过语音和文本处理大多数保单持有人的交互，直接遵循与索赔，欺诈，医疗服务，政策和维修系统接口的自学习脚本。解决许多索赔的周转时间是在几分钟而不是几天或几周内衡量的。人类主张管理重点关注一些领域：复杂和不寻常的主张，有争议的主张，在分析和数据驱动的洞察力中，人类互动和谈判赋予了与新技术产生的系统性问题和风险相关的主张（例如，黑客浸入关键的物联网，系统），以及对索赔的随机审查，以确保对算法决策的足够监督。

Claims organizations increase their focus on risk monitoring, prevention, and mitigation. IoT and new data sources are used to monitor risk and trigger interventions when factors exceed AI-defined thresholds. Customer interaction with insurance claims organizations focuses on avoiding potential loss. Individuals receive real-time alerts that may be linked with automatic interventions for inspection, maintenance, and repair. For large-scale catastrophe claims, insurers monitor homes and vehicles in real time using integrated IoT, telematics, and mobile phone data, assuming mobile phone service and power haven’t been disrupted in the area. When power goes out, insurers can prefile claims by using data aggregators, which consolidate data from satellites, networked drones, weather services, and policyholder data in real time. This system is pretested by the largest carriers across multiple catastrophe types, so highly accurate loss estimations are reliably filed in a real emergency. Detailed reports are automatically provided to reinsurers for faster reinsurance capital flow.  

索赔组织将注意力集中在风险监测，预防和缓解上。当因素超过AI定义的阈值时，物联网和新数据源用于监测风险和触发干预措施。客户与保险索赔组织的互动侧重于避免潜在的损失。个人会收到可能与自动干预措施有关检查，维护和维修的实时警报。对于大规模的灾难索赔，保险公司使用集成的物联网，远程信息处理和手机数据实时监视房屋和车辆，假设该地区的手机服务和电源并未受到干扰。当权力熄灭时，保险公司可以使用数据聚合器来优惠索赔，该数据聚合器可以实时合并来自卫星，网络无人机，天气服务和保单持有人数据的数据。该系统是由多种灾难类型中最大的载体预测试的，因此在实际紧急情况下可靠地提出了高度准确的损失估计。详细的报告会自动向再保险公司提供，以使更快的再保险资本流动。

## How insurers can prepare for accelerating changes  

保险公司如何准备加速变更

The rapid evolution of the industry will be fueled by the extensive adoption and integration of automation, deep learning, and external data ecosystems. While no one can predict exactly what insurance might look like in 2030, carriers can take several steps now to prepare for change.  

自动化，深度学习和外部数据生态系统的广泛采用和整合将推动该行业的快速发展。虽然没有人能确切预测2030年的保险可能是什么样的，但是现在，运营商可以采取几个步骤来为变更做准备。

### 1\. Get smart on AI-related technologies and trends  

1。在与AI相关的技术和趋势上聪明

Although the tectonic shifts in the industry will be tech-focused, addressing them is not the domain of the IT team. Instead, board members and customer-experience teams should invest the time and resources to build a deep understanding of these AI-related technologies. Part of this effort will require exploring hypothesis-driven scenarios in order to understand and highlight where and when disruption might occur—and what it means for certain business lines. For example, insurers are unlikely to gain much insights from limited-scale IoT pilot projects in discrete parts of the business. Instead, they must proceed with purpose and an understanding of how their organization might participate in the IoT ecosystem at scale. Pilots and proof-of-concept (POC) projects should be designed to test not just how a technology works but also how successful the carrier might be operating in a particular role within a data- or IoT-based ecosystem.  

尽管该行业的构造转变将以技术为本，但解决方案并不是IT团队的领域。相反，董事会成员和客户体验团队应投入时间和资源，以深入了解这些与AI相关的技术。这项工作的一部分将需要探索以假设为导向的场景，以便理解并强调可能发生干扰以及对某些业务界的含义。例如，保险公司不太可能从限量的IoT试点项目中获得很多见解，而在业务的离散部分中。相反，他们必须有目的地进行，并了解其组织如何大规模参与物联网生态系统。试验和概念验证（POC）项目不仅应测试技术的工作原理，而且还应测试运营商在基于数据或IoT的生态系统中的特定角色中的成功运作。

### 2\. Develop and begin implementation of a coherent strategic plan  

2。制定并开始实施连贯的战略计划

Building on the insights from AI explorations, carriers must decide how to use technology to support their business strategy. The senior leadership team’s long-term strategic plan will require a multiyear transformation that touches operations, talent, and technology. Some carriers are already beginning to take innovative approaches such as starting their own venture-capital arms, acquiring promising insurtech companies, and forging partnerships with leading academic institutions. Insurers should develop a perspective on areas they want to invest in to meet or beat the market and what strategic approach—for example, forming a new entity or building in-house strategic capabilities—is best suited for their organization.  

基于AI探索的见解，运营商必须决定如何使用技术来支持其业务战略。高级领导团队的长期战略计划将需要多年转型，以触及运营，人才和技术。一些运营商已经开始采用创新的方法，例如建立自己的风险资本武器，收购有前途的保险公司公司，并与领先的学术机构建立伙伴关系。保险公司应对他们想投资以满足或击败市场的领域的看法，以及哪种战略方法（例如，形成新的实体或建立内部战略能力）最适合其组织。

![There are four core elements in defining a successful AI strategy.](svgz_insurance-2030-ex2.svgz)

We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: [McKinsey\_Website\_Accessibility@mckinsey.com](mailto:McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com)

This plan should address all four dimensions involved in any large-scale, analytics-based initiative—everything from data to people to culture (Exhibit 2). The plan should outline a road map of AI-based pilots and POCs and detail which parts of the organization will require investments in skill building or focused change management. Most important, a detailed schedule of milestones and checkpoints is essential to allow the organization to determine, on a regular basis, how the plan should be modified to address any shifts in the evolution of AI technologies and significant changes or disruptions within the industry.  

该计划应解决任何基于分析的大规模，基于分析的计划 - 从数据到人到文化的一切（图2）。该计划应概述基于AI的飞行员和POC的路线图，并详细介绍组织的哪些部分需要在技能建设或集中的变更管理上进行投资。最重要的是，详细的里程碑和检查站的时间表对于允许组织定期确定应如何修改计划以解决AI技术演变的任何变化以及行业内的重大变化或中断至关重要。

In addition to being able to understand and implement AI technologies, carriers also need to develop strategic responses to coming macrolevel changes. As many lines shift toward a “predict and prevent” methodology, carriers will need to rethink their customer engagement and branding, product design, and core earnings. Auto accidents will be reduced through use of vehicles with self-driving capabilities, in-home flooding will be prevented by IoT devices, buildings will be reprinted after a natural disaster, and lives will be saved and extended by improved healthcare. Likewise, vehicles will still break down, natural disasters will continue to devastate coastal regions, and individuals will require effective medical care and support when a loved one passes. As these changes take root, profit pools will shift, new types and lines of products will emerge, and how consumers interact with their insurers will change substantially.  

除了能够理解和实施AI技术外，运营商还需要对即将到来的宏观变化产生战略反应。随着许多线路转向“预测和预防”方法，运营商将需要重新考虑其客户参与和品牌，产品设计和核心收入。通过使用具有自动驾驶能力的车辆将减少自动事故，物联网设备将预防内部洪水，自然灾害后将重印建筑物，并通过改善的医疗保健挽救和延长生命。同样，车辆仍然会崩溃，自然灾害将继续摧毁沿海地区，当亲人通过时，个人将需要有效的医疗服务和支持。随着这些变化的扎根，利润库将会发生变化，新类型和产品线将出现，消费者与保险公司的互动方式将发生实质性变化。

All of these efforts can produce a coherent analytics and technology strategy that addresses all aspects of the business, with a keen eye on both value creation and differentiation.  

所有这些努力都可以产生连贯的分析和技术策略，以敏锐地关注价值创造和差异化，以解决业务的各个方面。

### 3\. Create and execute a comprehensive data strategy  

3。创建并执行全面的数据策略

Data is fast becoming one of the most—if not the most—valuable asset for any organization. The insurance industry is no different: how carriers identify, quantify, place, and manage risk is all predicated on the volume and quality of data they acquire during a policy’s life cycle. Most AI technologies will perform best when they have a high volume of data from a variety of sources. As such, carriers must develop a well-structured and actionable strategy with regard to both internal and external data. Internal data will need to be organized in ways that enable and support the agile development of new analytics insights and capabilities. With external data, carriers must focus on securing access to data that enriches and complements their internal data sets. The real challenge will be gaining access in a cost-efficient way. As the external data ecosystem continues to expand, it will likely remain highly fragmented, making it quite difficult to identify high-quality data at a reasonable cost. Overall, data strategy will need to include a variety of ways to obtain and secure access to external data, as well as ways to combine this data with internal sources. Carriers should be prepared to have a multifaceted procurement strategy that could include the direct acquisition of data assets and providers, licensing of data sources, use of data APIs, and partnerships with data brokers.  

对于任何组织来说，数据迅速成为最多（如果不是最多的）资产之一。保险业并没有什么不同：运营商如何识别，量化，放置和管理风险都取决于他们在保单的生命周期中获得的数据的数量和质量。当来自各种来源的大量数据时，大多数AI技术都会表现最佳。因此，运营商必须针对内部和外部数据制定结构良好且可行的策略。内部数据将需要以实现和支持新分析见解和能力的敏捷开发的方式进行组织。借助外部数据，运营商必须专注于确保访问丰富和补充其内部数据集的数据。真正的挑战将是以经济高效的方式获得访问权限。随着外部数据生态系统的不断扩展，它可能会保持高度分散，因此很难以合理的成本识别高质量数据。总体而言，数据策略将需要包括各种获取和保护对外部数据的访问的方法，以及将这些数据与内部来源相结合的方法。运营商应准备制定多方面的采购策略，其中可能包括直接获取数据资产和提供商，数据源许可，数据API的使用以及与数据经纪人的合作伙伴关系。

### 4\. Create the right talent and technology infrastructure  

4。创建合适的人才和技术基础设施

In augmented chess, average players enabled by AI tend to do better than expert chess players enabled by the same AI. The underlying reason for this counterintuitive outcome depends on whether the individual interacting with AI embraces, trusts, and understands the supporting technology. To ensure that every part of the organization views advanced analytics as a must-have capability, carriers must make measured but sustained investments in people. The insurance organization of the future will [require talent with the right mindsets and skills](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-us-insurers-can-build-a-winning-digital-workforce-for-the-future). The next generation of successful frontline insurance workers will be in increasingly high demand and must possess a unique mix of being technologically adept, creative, and willing to work at something that will not be a static process but rather a mix of semiautomated and machine-supported tasks that continually evolve. Generating value from the AI use cases of the future will require carriers to integrate skills, technology, and insights from around the organization to deliver unique, holistic customer experiences. Doing so will require a conscious culture shift for most carriers that will rely on buy-in and leadership from the executive suite. Developing an aggressive strategy to attract, cultivate, and retain a variety of workers with critical skill sets will be essential to keep pace. These roles will include data engineers, data scientists, technologists, cloud computing specialists, and experience designers. To retain knowledge while also ensuring the business has the new skills and capabilities necessary to compete, many organizations will design and implement reskilling programs. As a last component of developing the new workforce, organizations will identify external resources and partners to augment in-house capabilities that will help carriers secure the needed support for business evolution and execution. The IT architecture of the future will also be radically different from today’s. Carriers should start making targeted investments to enable the migration to a more future-forward technology stack that can support a [two-speed IT architecture](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/modernizing-it-for-a-digital-era).

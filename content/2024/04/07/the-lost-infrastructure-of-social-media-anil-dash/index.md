### More than a decade ago, the earliest era of blogging provided a set of separate but related technologies that helped the nascent form thrive.  

Today, most have faded away and been forgotten, but new incarnations of these features could still be valuable.  

十多年前，最早的博客时代提供了一系列独立但相关的技术，帮助这种新生形式茁壮成长。如今，大部分技术已逐渐消失并被人们遗忘，但这些功能的新化身仍然很有价值。

___

As social networks grew in popularity and influence, the old decentralized blogosphere fell apart and those early services consolidated, leaving all the power in the hands of a few private companies.  

随着社交网络越来越受欢迎，影响力越来越大，旧有的分散式博客圈分崩离析，早期的服务也随之整合，所有权力都掌握在少数几家私营公司手中。  

That’s left publishers and independent voices even more vulnerable to the control points of a few social networks and search engines.  

这使得出版商和独立声音更容易受到少数社交网络和搜索引擎控制点的影响。

## Open Features  

开放式功能

The core capabilities in the early era of blogging acted as open features for any site, and helped popularize social media itself, regardless of what site the content appeared on.  

早期博客的核心功能对任何网站都是开放式的，并帮助普及了社交媒体本身，无论内容出现在哪个网站上。  

But many of these open features have either disappeared or exist only in proprietary versions on closed platforms today, which means they only work between sites that use the same tools to publish.  

但如今，这些开放功能中的许多要么已经消失，要么只存在于封闭平台上的专有版本中，这意味着它们只能在使用相同工具发布的网站之间运行。

**Below is a table offering a quick survey of these features.** Note: The companies and products listed in each column are illustrative and are not intended to be comprehensive; there were many competitive services in the early era of blogging, and the few services that still exist generally live on as zombie services with almost no users today.  

下面的表格提供了这些功能的快速概览。注：每栏中列出的公司和产品仅供参考，并不全面；在博客的早期时代，有许多竞争性服务，而现在仍然存在的少数服务一般都是僵尸服务，几乎没有用户。

These features are still valuable, which is why closed networks like Medium, Tumblr and WordPress.com offer analogous features such as the ability to follow other users.  

这些功能仍然很有价值，这也是 Medium、Tumblr 和 WordPress.com 等封闭式网络提供类似功能（如关注其他用户）的原因。  

These sites also typically provide “reader” features for seeing updates from friends.  

这些网站通常还提供 "阅读器 "功能，用于查看朋友的更新。  

In the table below, \* indicates capabilities that are no longer available across sites but may be provided within closed networks.  

在下表中，"\*"表示各站点不再提供的功能，但可能在封闭网络内提供。

## What could these features do?  

这些功能可以做什么？

### Publishing  

出版

The core capability of publishing articles to the web remains fairly mature and robust, and has seen new energy since the release of great writing tools like Medium.  

在网络上发表文章的核心功能仍然相当成熟和强大，自从 Medium 等优秀写作工具发布以来，这一功能又焕发出新的活力。  

There’s not much to add here, but we still see the same general divergence between widely-available, simple tools that are focused on ease of use, and high-end powerful tools that offer serious publishers a lot of structure and tools for publishing.  

这里没有什么可补充的，但我们仍然可以看到，在注重易用性的广泛使用的简单工具和为严肃的出版商提供大量出版结构和工具的高端强大工具之间，存在着同样普遍的分歧。

### Search  

搜索

As extraordinary as it seems now, there was a point when one could search most of the blogs in the world and get a reasonably complete and up-to-date set of results in return.  

尽管现在看来很不寻常，但曾几何时，人们可以搜索世界上大多数博客，并得到一套相当完整的最新结果。  

Technorati was a pioneering service here, and started by actually attempting to crawl all of the blogs on the Internet each time they updated; later this architecture evolved to require a “ping” (see Updates, below) each time a site updated.  

Technorati 是这项服务的先驱，一开始是在每次更新时尝试抓取互联网上的所有博客；后来，这种架构发展到每次网站更新时都需要 "ping"（见下文的 "更新"）。  

On the current internet, we can see relatively complete search results for hashtags or terms within Twitter or some other closed networks, but the closure of Google Blog Search in 2011 marked the end of “blog search” as a discrete product separate from general web search or news search.  

在当前的互联网上，我们可以在 Twitter 或其他一些封闭网络中看到相对完整的标签或术语搜索结果，但 2011 年谷歌博客搜索的关闭标志着 "博客搜索 "作为一种独立于普通网络搜索或新闻搜索的产品的终结。  

It’s easy to imagine that modern search software and vastly cheaper hardware make it possible to recreate a search engine for frequently-updated sites like news sites and blogs, with domain-specific features that general tools like Google News don’t offer.  

不难想象，现代搜索软件和便宜得多的硬件使我们有可能为新闻网站和博客等更新频繁的网站重新创建一个搜索引擎，并提供谷歌新闻等通用工具所不具备的特定领域功能。

### Comments  

评论

In the early days of blogging, not every publishing tool supported comments natively; as a result, third-party commenting services popped up to meet the need.  

在博客发展初期，并不是所有的发布工具都支持原生评论；因此，第三方评论服务应运而生，以满足这一需求。  

As the major tools incorporated their own commenting features, comment services came to be used primarily by big publishers using unwieldy content management systems that didn’t natively support commenting features.  

随着主要工具都加入了自己的评论功能，评论服务开始主要由使用笨重的内容管理系统的大出版商使用，因为这些系统本身并不支持评论功能。  

In the earlier era, comment systems were built without anticipating the ways that online communities would grow, and these serious design flaws enabled the widespread abuse that we see online today.  

在早期，评论系统的建立没有预料到网络社区会以何种方式发展，这些严重的设计缺陷导致了我们今天在网上看到的广泛滥用。  

Newer tools seem to be trying to put the genie back in the bottle, but large publishers are increasingly shutting down comments entirely rather than investing in building a healthy community.  

较新的工具似乎正试图把精灵放回瓶子里，但大型出版商越来越多地完全关闭评论，而不是投资建立一个健康的社区。

### Responses  

答复

One category of interaction between sites that’s nearly disappeared is the idea of structured responses between different authors or even different sites.  

有一类网站之间的互动几乎已经消失，那就是不同作者甚至不同网站之间的结构化回应。  

Though Medium supports a limited version of this feature today, early tools like Trackback and Pingback made it possible for almost any site to let another site know that their story or article had inspired a response.  

虽然 Medium 目前只支持这一功能的有限版本，但 Trackback 和 Pingback 等早期工具几乎让所有网站都能让其他网站知道他们的故事或文章引起了回应。  

Typically, those responses were shown under an article, similar to comments, but once Google introduced its advertising platforms like AdSense, links between sites suddenly had monetary value and spam links soon followed.  

通常情况下，这些回复会显示在文章下方，类似于评论，但一旦谷歌推出 AdSense 等广告平台，网站之间的链接就突然有了金钱价值，垃圾链接也很快随之而来。  

A modern reinvention of Trackback-style features could connect conversations on different websites in the same way that @ replies work on Twitter.  

对 Trackback 风格功能的现代重塑，可以像 Twitter 上的 @ 回复一样，将不同网站上的对话连接起来。

### Likes / Favorites  

喜欢/收藏

Though we think of liking, hearting, starring and favoriting things as one of the main actions on social media, these behaviors are a relatively recent phenomenon, only having risen in prominence over the last decade.  

尽管我们认为 "喜欢"、"点赞"、"打星 "和 "收藏 "是社交媒体上的主要行为之一，但这些行为是最近才出现的现象，在过去十年中才逐渐兴起。  

As a result, they had no real “open” implementation that worked across different sites, and have only ever been built as features within closed networks.  

因此，它们没有真正的 "开放 "实施，无法在不同的网站上运行，只能作为封闭网络中的功能。  

Favoriting or liking content remains a really important online social signal, so it’s easy to imagine that likes between different services could be connected, so a creator would know when someone had liked their work on another network or site.  

收藏或喜欢内容仍然是一个非常重要的网络社交信号，因此很容易想象不同服务之间的 "喜欢 "可以连接起来，这样创作者就能知道什么时候有人喜欢了他在另一个网络或网站上的作品。

### Updates  

更新

A relatively technical feature of the open blogosphere was the ability for one site to let others know when it had been updated.  

开放博客圈的一个相对技术性的特点是，一个网站可以让其他网站知道它何时更新。  

This was important at the time because technologies for easily and efficiently crawling large numbers of sites were still relatively expensive.  

这在当时非常重要，因为当时轻松高效地抓取大量网站的技术还相对昂贵。  

While the tech has gotten cheaper since then, the number of sites has increased massively, so this still remains a challenging area, and there may well still be value in a site being able to tell other services that it has new content that’s been updated.  

虽然此后技术成本越来越低，但网站数量却大幅增加，因此这仍然是一个具有挑战性的领域。  

Indeed, a huge number of automated updates on services like Twitter are doing little more than sending such notifications; making a structured and trusted way to do so would still be worthwhile.  

事实上，Twitter 等服务上的大量自动更新都只是在发送此类通知，而建立一种有序、可信的方式仍然值得一试。  

Many blockchain enthusiasts also like the idea of connecting such update notifications to the blockchain to act as a trusted record of content being published, a capability that is genuinely new to this era of the Internet.  

许多区块链爱好者还喜欢将这种更新通知与区块链连接起来，作为发布内容的可信记录，这是互联网时代真正的新功能。

### Identity  

身份

Many of the key features of interacting with social media sites, especially commenting, were originally built with no real support for an identity or login system, in keeping with the early web’s extreme preference for anonymity and privacy.  

与社交媒体网站互动的许多关键功能，尤其是评论功能，最初都没有真正支持身份或登录系统，这与早期网络对匿名和隐私的极端偏好是一致的。  

Once it became clear that identity systems could allow for persistent identities, some forms of trust systems, and can in some cases help build more accountable communities, early login systems were created to let people sign in when commenting.  

一旦人们意识到身份系统可以实现持久身份和某种形式的信任系统，并在某些情况下有助于建立更负责任的社区，早期的登录系统就应运而生，让人们在发表评论时登录。  

Due to obtuse technical goals and desires not to infringe on user privacy, the user experience of these early services was very poor, and eventually they were generally replaced by simple, centralized systems like Facebook and Twitter sign-in.  

由于模糊的技术目标和不侵犯用户隐私的愿望，这些早期服务的用户体验很差，最终普遍被简单的集中式系统所取代，如 Facebook 和 Twitter 的登录系统。  

The unfortunate side effect of the poor user experience of those early sign-in systems was the entrenchment of dominant corporate identity systems, which enabled the mass surveillance of user behaviors by both the giant companies as well as governmental agencies.  

早期的登录系统用户体验不佳，其不幸的副作用是主导企业身份系统的根深蒂固，使巨头公司和政府机构得以对用户行为进行大规模监控。  

Given the abuses of those identities, it’s easy to imagine a modern incarnation of these sites using pseudonymous identities that aren’t tied to one’s high-visibility social networking profiles.  

考虑到这些身份的滥用，我们不难想象这些网站的现代版本会使用与个人的高知名度社交网络档案无关的假名身份。

### Friend Lists  

好友列表

Friend lists!  

好友列表！  

It’s hard to imagine how important these were in the pre-social networking era of the web, but a simple blogroll linking to favorite sites or friends was a very effective way of both driving traffic and providing a bit of an identity for a site’s author.  

很难想象，在前社交网络时代，这些东西有多重要，但一个简单的博客列表，链接到最喜欢的网站或朋友，是一种非常有效的方式，既能带来流量，又能为网站作者提供一点身份认同感。  

Initially, services offered a simple list of links, though this eventually evolved into a list sorted by the most-recently-updated sites.  

最初，该服务只提供一个简单的链接列表，但最终发展成为一个按最新网站排序的列表。  

A further evolution came when specialized services like MyBlogLog introduced a list of people who had visited a site, complete with their avatars.  

随着 MyBlogLog 等专业服务推出访问过网站的人的名单，并附有他们的头像，这种服务又有了进一步的发展。  

These features together formed the precedent for the common lists on many of today’s social networks that show who you follow, and who follows you.  

这些功能共同构成了当今许多社交网络上的常用列表的先例，这些列表显示你关注了谁，谁又关注了你。

### Following  

后续行动

The appearance of friend lists quickly suggested the ability for users to follow other users for updates.  

好友列表的出现很快让用户能够关注其他用户的更新。  

Though this was present from the earliest days of blogging on services like LiveJournal, the feature never truly made its way to publishing-oriented tools, and subsequent efforts to introduce open ways of following users on different sites have not taken off, remaining largely the domain of a small community that tinkers with technical standards.  

虽然在 LiveJournal 等服务上最早就有了这种功能，但该功能从未真正应用到面向发布的工具上，而且后来为引入在不同网站上关注用户的开放方式所做的努力也未见成效，在很大程度上仍然是一个研究技术标准的小社区的领域。  

Of course, the closed-network model that LiveJournal pioneered remains a staple of today’s social networks, with following being a core feature on nearly every social platform.  

当然，LiveJournal 首创的封闭式网络模式仍是当今社交网络的主流，关注几乎是每个社交平台的核心功能。  

Following of course always implied something more than just getting delivery of another user’s content, and various efforts were made to codify and more specifically define the relationships between users who had followed or friended one another.  

当然，"关注 "并不仅仅意味着获取另一个用户的内容，人们还努力将 "关注 "或 "加为好友 "的用户之间的关系编成法典，并对其进行更具体的定义。

### Syndication  

聚合

At the same time as early social tools were developing the ability for humans to follow other humans, users were recognizing that they wanted their software and tools to be able to subscribe to updates from their favorite sites.  

在早期的社交工具开发出人类关注其他人的能力的同时，用户也意识到，他们希望自己的软件和工具能够订阅他们最喜欢的网站的更新。  

This could be for the purposes of reading sites more easily (see Aggregation and Time Shifting & Reading, below), or for use in automation or analysis tools.  

这样做的目的可能是为了更方便地阅读网站（见下文 "聚合和时移与阅读"），也可能是为了用于自动化或分析工具。  

Though there were various attempts at syndication formats in the early days of the web, RSS took off as the signature format for blogging, and a protracted standards battle (akin to AMP vs.  

尽管在网络发展初期曾有过各种聚合格式的尝试，但 RSS 作为博客的标志性格式一炮而红，并引发了一场旷日持久的标准之争（类似于 AMP 与 RSS 之争）。  

Instant Articles today, but with a lot more vitriol) produced the Atom format, which basically did the same thing.  

今天的 Instant Articles（即时文章，但更多的是谩骂）产生了 Atom 格式，基本上做了同样的事情。  

Syndication formats were useful not just for being machine-readable but because producing content in these formats implied a certain set of reuse and transformation permissions that was useful for software creators.  

Syndication 格式之所以有用，不仅是因为它可以被机器读取，而且还因为以这些格式制作内容意味着一定的重用和转换权限，这对软件创作者来说非常有用。  

Today, Google (along with Twitter and other partners) is pushing AMP, Facebook is pushing Instant Articles, and Apple is advocating its Apple News format (which is based on RSS).  

如今，谷歌（以及 Twitter 和其他合作伙伴）正在推动 AMP，Facebook 正在推动 Instant Articles，而苹果则在倡导其 Apple News 格式（基于 RSS）。  

Though these formats are being motivated by a desire to improve the mobile reading experience, their goal of strict machine readability and their suitability to the tasks of aggregation, time shifting and easy reading make them a direct analog to RSS and other formats that came before.  

尽管这些格式的动机是为了改善移动阅读体验，但其严格的机器可读性目标以及对聚合、时间转移和简易阅读任务的适用性，使其成为 RSS 和其他早期格式的直接类似物。

### API

While a lot of content for the web is, and has been, written in web browsers, the unreliability of creating content in a browser has always driven a desire to create writing tools that connect to publishing systems. This desire for blogging apps has only increased with the move to mobile, given the increased likelihood of connectivity problems and the finicky nature of mobile browsers.  

尽管许多网络内容都是在网络浏览器中编写的，而且一直以来都是如此，但在浏览器中创建内容的不稳定性一直促使人们希望创建可连接到发布系统的写作工具。随着移动技术的发展，出现连接问题的可能性增加，加上移动浏览器的不稳定性，人们对博客应用程序的渴望与日俱增。  

In the earliest days of blogging, publishing systems supported APIs like Metaweblog and (later) the Atom API to allow apps to connect to their services and post or update content.  

在最早的博客时代，发布系统支持 Metaweblog 和（后来的）Atom API 等应用程序接口，允许应用程序连接到其服务并发布或更新内容。  

These APIs were often limited, though, not exposing all of the features of a publishing platform, and making it difficult or impossible to manage other aspects of a site like embedding content, modifying design, or managing comments.  

不过，这些应用程序接口往往有局限性，不能提供发布平台的所有功能，而且很难或无法管理网站的其他方面，如嵌入内容、修改设计或管理评论。  

Today’s newer publishing platforms typically have proprietary APIs with custom mobile client apps that offer robust features but with only limited feature access for third parties which want to publish or update content.  

如今较新的发布平台通常都有专有的应用程序接口和定制的移动客户端应用程序，可提供强大的功能，但对于想要发布或更新内容的第三方来说，只能访问有限的功能。

### Metadata  

元数据

It’s probably not surprising given that the web itself was born out of communities of researchers who wanted to share their work, but the early blogosphere was full of people who obsessed over “correctly” labeling and organizing content.  

鉴于网络本身诞生于希望分享工作成果的研究人员社区，这也许并不奇怪，但早期的博客圈却充满了执着于 "正确 "标记和组织内容的人。  

A tremendous amount of energy went into encouraging adoption of various standards for metadata and content description, under initiatives like RDF, Dublin Core, and a broad set of efforts referred to collectively as the Semantic Web.  

在 RDF、都柏林核心（Dublin Core）等倡议以及统称为 "语义网 "的一系列广泛努力下，人们花费了大量精力鼓励采用各种元数据和内容描述标准。  

Amongst these efforts, the only one to every really see significant traction was the Creative Commons project, which enabled the explicit tagging of rights permissions on a media object.  

在这些努力中，唯一真正取得重大进展的是 "知识共享"（Creative Commons）项目。  

As the early efforts faded away, a surprisingly effective and pragmatic wave of new metadata offerings took their place.  

随着早期的努力逐渐消失，新的元数据产品浪潮取而代之，其效果和实用性令人惊讶。  

First, during the peak of the SEO era, HTML5 and its related microdata tools enabled smart ways of marking up content on a page.  

首先，在搜索引擎优化的高峰期，HTML5 及其相关的微数据工具实现了在页面上标记内容的智能方法。  

Then, as social networks become more dominant, their formats like Open Graph (Facebook), Cards (Twitter), and Schema.org (Google+ and others) made it easy to add common metadata like author credits and publishing information.  

随后，随着社交网络变得越来越重要，其格式（如 Open Graph（Facebook）、Cards（Twitter）和 Schema.org（Google+ 和其他））使得添加作者署名和出版信息等通用元数据变得更加容易。  

These metadata hints were used to make nice displays like the thumbnail images in a Twitter Card or a Pinterest Pin, and that attractive presentation drove widespread adoption of the formats.  

这些元数据提示被用来制作漂亮的显示效果，就像 Twitter Card 或 Pinterest Pin 中的缩略图一样，这种有吸引力的显示效果推动了这些格式的广泛采用。  

It’s striking that we likely have author information provided as metadata on the majority of articles published today, but almost none of our reading tools expose this information in useful ways, or let us search or explore using the metadata.  

令人震惊的是，在当今出版的大多数文章中，我们可能都有作为元数据提供的作者信息，但几乎没有一种阅读工具能以有用的方式揭示这些信息，或让我们利用元数据进行搜索或探索。

### Discovery & Tagging  

发现和标记

The flip side to metadata being provided in articles and stories is being able to discover content using that metadata.  

在文章和故事中提供元数据的另一面是能够利用这些元数据发现内容。  

When Technorati was at its most effective, the simple text tags used to label articles (precursors to today’s social media hashtags, and similar in function to the article categories used on news sites) could be explored across various sites, so all articles about a topic were discoverable regardless of where they were published.  

Technorati 最有效的时候，用于标注文章的简单文本标签（今天社交媒体标签的前身，功能类似于新闻网站上使用的文章分类）可以在不同网站上浏览，因此无论文章在哪里发布，都可以发现所有与某个主题相关的文章。  

Today, that capability exists in limited function on sites like Medium, WordPress.com and Tumblr, but it’s so hidden as to be almost invisible.  

如今，这种功能已经在 Medium、WordPress.com 和 Tumblr 等网站上有限地发挥着作用，但却隐蔽得几乎看不见。  

The odd result of this is that we have trending topics in networks like Twitter and Facebook, where the vast majority of updates are short and trivial, but we don’t have easily-explorable tags, hashtags or trending topics for articles and stories that are longer and more substantive.  

这样做的奇怪结果是，我们在 Twitter 和 Facebook 等网络中拥有流行话题，而这些网络中的绝大多数更新都是短小精悍的，但对于篇幅较长、内容更为充实的文章和故事，我们却没有易于探索的标签、哈希标签或流行话题。  

It’s not hard to picture how different a trending topics list could look like if connected to major media sites and blogs, instead of just social network updates.  

不难想象，如果趋势主题列表与主要媒体网站和博客相连，而不仅仅是社交网络更新，会有多么大的不同。

### Analytics  

分析

Many of the key improvements that happened to today’s major analytics tools like Google Analytics or Chartbeat began with features designed for social media and blogging.  

如今，Google Analytics 或 Chartbeat 等主要分析工具的许多重要改进，都是从为社交媒体和博客设计的功能开始的。  

Measure Map was a small but well-designed tool meant to provide analytics to bloggers; its team was acquired by Google and went on to remake much of Google’s Analytics service in the image of their product.  

Measure Map 是一款小巧但设计精良的工具，旨在为博客作者提供分析服务；其团队被谷歌收购后，以其产品的形象重新打造了谷歌的大部分分析服务。  

Similarly, the once-independent FeedBurner service provided detailed readership analytics for people whose content was distributed via RSS, but it too was folded into Google’s infrastructure after an acquisition and the only similar features today are ones like Medium’s stats dashboard, which only shows activity within Medium’s network.  

同样，曾经独立的 FeedBurner 服务也为那些通过 RSS 传播内容的人提供了详细的读者分析，但它也在被收购后并入了谷歌的基础设施，如今类似的功能只有 Medium 的统计仪表板，它只显示 Medium 网络内的活动。  

It may well make sense for analytics features to be deeply integrated within a publishing platform, but it’s striking that most of today’s tools (with the notable exception of closed publishing platforms like LinkedIn) still don’t offer basic social insights on readers as was available from MyBlogLog and others a dozen years ago.  

将分析功能深度整合到出版平台中也许是有道理的，但令人吃惊的是，如今的大多数工具（LinkedIn 等封闭式出版平台是个明显的例外）仍然没有像十几年前的 MyBlogLog 和其他平台那样提供有关读者的基本社交洞察。

### Advertising  

广告

It’s hard to believe, but much of the fundamental infrastructure of today’s online advertising economy was first beta-tested on blogs.  

很难相信，当今在线广告经济的许多基本架构都是在博客上首次测试的。  

Many of the earliest and most influential adopters of Google AdSense were independent blogs looking to make money on the web after the crash of the first wave of Internet advertising networks.  

谷歌 AdSense 的许多最早和最有影响力的采用者都是独立博客，他们希望在第一波互联网广告网络浪潮崩溃后在网络上赚钱。  

Blog-centric display ad networks also thrived, first with relatively simple services like BlogAds, vertical networks like The Deck and BlogHer, and premium publishing networks like Federated Media.  

以博客为中心的展示广告网络也蓬勃发展，首先是相对简单的服务（如 BlogAds）、垂直网络（如 The Deck 和 BlogHer）以及优质出版网络（如 Federated Media）。  

Over time, the online advertising ecosystem got more and more automated, and then evolved to incorporate first display ads and then video ads, and all of these changes disadvantaged small players.  

随着时间的推移，网络广告生态系统变得越来越自动化，随后先是纳入了显示广告，然后又纳入了视频广告，所有这些变化都不利于小型参与者。  

Entirely gone were the advertising and discovery platforms which prioritized readership over monetization, like web rings and other peer-to-peer tools.  

广告和发现平台（如网络圈和其他点对点工具）已荡然无存，这些平台将读者数量置于货币化之上。  

Today, Google’s domination of conventional web advertising is enormous, and mobile ad dollars are shifting rapidly to Facebook, which is trying to move both content and advertising entirely within its walls through the advance of Instant Articles.  

如今，谷歌在传统网络广告领域占据着巨大的优势，而移动广告的资金正迅速转向 Facebook，后者正试图通过即时文章（Instant Articles）的发展，将内容和广告完全转移到其内部。  

The overreach of intrusive and interruptive online advertising has hastened this transition as users increasingly adopt ad blockers to stop sites from slowing down their reading or exposing their data.  

随着用户越来越多地采用广告拦截器来阻止网站降低他们的阅读速度或暴露他们的数据，侵入性和干扰性在线广告的过度扩张加速了这一转变。  

Ironically, the simple text ads that blogs pioneered may come back into vogue in the new era of lightweight, mobile-optimized pages.  

具有讽刺意味的是，在轻量级、移动优化页面的新时代，博客开创的简单文本广告可能会重新流行起来。

### Aggregation  

汇总

Just as Syndication and Following became core behaviors for early bloggers, so too did the ability to read updates from many different sites all in one place.  

正如 "同步 "和 "关注 "成为早期博主的核心行为一样，在一个地方阅读来自多个不同网站的更新也成为博主的核心行为。  

My Yahoo was a pioneer of placing lots of headlines on one page, but early RSS readers like Bloglines and Userland Radio and, later, Google Reader, made for a unified reading experience that was as straightforward as checking email.  

我的雅虎是将大量标题放在一个页面上的先驱，但早期的 RSS 阅读器，如 Bloglines 和 Userland Radio，以及后来的 Google Reader，都提供了统一的阅读体验，就像检查电子邮件一样简单。  

It was very hard to tell whether this behavior would become popular—there just aren’t that many diehard news junkies, and their numbers were overrepresented in the early days of social media.  

很难说这种行为是否会流行起来，因为没有那么多死忠的新闻迷，而且在社交媒体发展初期，他们的人数过多。  

But some parts of this habit have become commonplace as people discover the majority of the content they consume online through the update feeds of their social networks.  

但这种习惯的某些部分已经变得司空见惯，因为人们在网上消费的大部分内容都是通过社交网络的更新馈送发现的。  

Today, Facebook and others provide some of the functionality of aggregation, particularly when reading Instant Articles, but the behavior of subscribing to any site and reading it in an aggregator app has shrunken down to a tiny audience of legacy users.  

如今，Facebook 和其他公司提供了聚合的部分功能，尤其是在阅读 Instant Articles 时，但订阅任何网站并在聚合应用程序中阅读的行为已经缩减到传统用户的一小部分受众。

### Time Shifting & Reading  

时空转换与阅读

Closely related to Aggregation is the user behavior of Time Shifting & Reading.  

与聚合密切相关的是用户的时移和阅读行为。  

Given that, at the time, many sites were still experimenting with basic design concepts, the early web wasn’t always easy to read.  

当时，许多网站仍在尝试基本的设计概念，因此早期的网页并不总是很容易阅读。  

Tools focused on reformatting articles for maximum readability, including the conveniently-named Readability and category-defining Instapaper, became popular with power users.  

为了最大限度地提高文章的可读性，一些专注于重新格式化文章的工具，包括方便命名的Readability和分类定义的Instapaper，开始受到高级用户的欢迎。  

These were slightly different than aggregator apps, because users would generally invoke them on an article-by-article basis, rather than subscribing to entire sites within them.  

这些应用程序与聚合应用程序略有不同，因为用户通常是逐条调用，而不是在其中订阅整个网站。  

Along the way, the apps provided both ad-blocking and time-shifting (offline caching) features aimed at further enhancing readability.  

同时，这些应用程序还提供了广告拦截和时移（离线缓存）功能，旨在进一步提高可读性。  

It’s easy to see the influence of these tools on AMP and Instant Articles today, and it’s straightforward to imagine how this capability will be reborn using these modern formats.  

不难看出这些工具对现在的 AMP 和 Instant Articles 的影响，也可以直接想象这种功能将如何利用这些现代格式重生。

## The Lessons  

经验教训

Above all, it’s important to remember that there’s (almost) nothing new under the sun.  

最重要的是，要记住太阳底下（几乎）没有新鲜事。  

Smart people have been thinking about how to publish on the Internet for as long as there’s been an Internet.  

自从有了互联网，聪明人就一直在思考如何在互联网上发表文章。  

Ideas come and go, sometimes disappearing because they’re not in fashion, other times because of the impact of the market or of a dominant player in the industry.  

创意来来去去，有时因为不流行而消失，有时因为市场或行业主导者的影响而消失。

Ultimately, though, I think most of these ideas were good ideas the first time around and will remain good ideas in whatever modern incarnation revives them for a new generation.  

不过，归根结底，我认为这些想法中的大多数第一次都是好想法，而且无论以何种现代形式重新呈现在新一代面前，它们仍然是好想法。  

I have no doubt there’s a billion-dollar company waiting to be founded based on revisiting one of the concepts outlined here.  

我毫不怀疑，只要重新审视这里概述的其中一个概念，就会有一家价值十亿美元的公司等着你去创立。

My hope is that those who are building tools today will see what’s come before and use it as inspiration to help give voice to people on the web in ways that are a bit more open-ended and a little less corporate-controlled than the platforms we have today.  

我希望今天那些正在开发工具的人能够看到前人的成果，并以此为灵感，帮助人们在网络上发出自己的声音，与今天的平台相比，这种方式更开放一些，也更少受到企业的控制。

I'm really not qualified to give advice. But enough people DM'd me on Twitter, so here it is.  

我真的没有资格给予建议。但有足够多的人在Twitter上DM我，所以在这里。  

I don't have to answer the same question over and over again.  

我不需要一遍又一遍地回答同样的问题。  

After some more editing I realised that I am actually writing this for my younger sister Katherine.  

经过一些更多的编辑，我意识到我实际上是为我的妹妹凯瑟琳写这篇文章。

If you want to know who I am, check out [blog/whoami](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/01/01/whoami/) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jxnlco).  

如果你想知道我是谁，请查看我的博客/whoami或我的Twitter。

Don't read this if you're seeking a nuanced perspective  

如果你在寻找一个微妙的视角，

These are simply the lies I tell myself to keep on living my life in [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)). I'm not saying this is the right way to do things. I'm just saying this is how I did things.  

这些只是我告诉自己的谎言，让我继续真诚地生活。我不是说这是正确的做事方式。我是说我就是这么做事的。  

I will do my best to color my advice with my own experiences, but I'm not going to pretend that the suffering and the privilege I've experienced is universal.  

我会尽我所能用我自己的经历来美化我的建议，但我不会假装我所经历的痛苦和特权是普遍的。

Choosing  

选择

You'll notice that I use the word "choosing" frequently.  

你会注意到我经常使用“选择”这个词。  

I genuinely believe that we are always making choices and that we have the ability to choose.  

我真的相信我们总是在做出选择，我们有能力做出选择。  

Choosing can be terrifying because it means we are accountable for our decisions, and there are infinite options before us.  

选择可能是可怕的，因为它意味着我们要对自己的决定负责，我们面前有无限的选择。  

It is also frightening because once we have made a decision, we must live with it, it is the death of optionality.  

这也是可怕的，因为一旦我们做出了决定，我们必须忍受它，这是选择性的死亡。  

But I believe that choosing is the only way to live authentically.  

但我相信选择是活得真实的唯一途径。

-   **Existential Despair**: A feeling of hopelessness rooted in the existentialist belief that life lacks inherent meaning.  
    
    潜在的绝望：一种源于存在主义信仰的绝望感，认为生活缺乏内在的意义。  
    
    This despair arises from the realization of one's absolute freedom and the responsibility for creating one's own essence and purpose.  
    
    这种绝望来自于一个人的绝对自由的实现和创造自己的本质和目的的责任。
    
-   **Anguish**: In existentialism, anguish is the emotional response to recognizing the vastness of one's freedom and the accompanying responsibility for one's actions.  
    
    痛苦：在存在主义中，痛苦是一种情感反应，承认一个人的自由和随之而来的责任，一个人的行动。  
    
    It involves the realization that each decision shapes one's essence and affects others, leading to a deep sense of moral responsibility.  
    
    它涉及到认识到每一个决定都塑造了一个人的本质并影响到他人，从而产生深刻的道德责任感。
    

There's a joke I once heard about a philosopher.  

我听过一个关于哲学家的笑话。  

Before going to bed, he wonders if he will be thirsty during the night.  

睡觉前，他想知道他晚上是否会口渴。  

So, he goes to the kitchen and places two cups beside his bed: one filled with water and the other left empty, just in case he doesn't want any water.  

所以，他去了厨房，在床边放了两个杯子：一个装满了水，另一个是空的，以防万一他不想喝水。

## How to Be Lucky[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#how-to-be-lucky "Permanent link")  

如何成为幸运儿¶

You make your own luck.  

你自己创造运气。  

There's a great experiment that I can't cite, but it has stuck in my mind since I was a child.  

有一个伟大的实验，我不能引用，但它一直在我的脑海里，因为我是一个孩子。  

They identified people as lucky and unlucky, and asked them to count the number of photographs in a newspaper.  

他们将人们分为幸运者和不幸者，并让他们数一数报纸上的照片数量。  

The unlucky people took a long time to count the photographs, while the lucky people took a very short time.  

不幸的人花了很长时间来数照片，而幸运的人花了很短的时间。  

The reason is that the unlucky people were so focused on counting the photographs that they missed the giant text that said, "Stop counting, there are 43 photographs in this newspaper."  

原因是那些倒霉的人太专注于数照片了，以至于他们错过了一个巨大的文字，上面写着：“停止计数，这张报纸上有43张照片。“

What I took away from this experiment was the idea that it might not be the case that lucky people and unlucky people have different opportunities, but rather that their field of perception is wider.  

我从这个实验中得到的想法是，幸运的人和不幸的人可能没有不同的机会，而是他们的感知范围更广。  

Lucky people can actually see the opportunities.  

幸运的人可以看到机会。  

A lucky person and an unlucky person might meet the same businessman, but they might talk about different things.  

一个幸运的人和一个不幸的人可能会遇到同一个商人，但他们可能会谈论不同的事情。  

One could be presented with or ask for an opportunity that the unlucky person doesn't even see as possible.  

一个人可能会得到或要求一个机会，不幸的人甚至没有看到作为可能的。

I often ask myself, "Okay, I'm focused on getting X, but let's not forget to read the headlines."  

我经常问自己，“好吧，我专注于获得X，但让我们不要忘记阅读标题。“

## How to Get a Job[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#how-to-get-a-job "Permanent link")  

如何找到工作¶

I've never gotten a job by applying to it. It's always been referrals or someone reaching out to me.  

我从来没有通过申请得到过一份工作，一直都是别人推荐或者主动联系我。  

So honestly, my resume is shit compared to my peers.  

所以说实话，我的简历和我的同龄人比起来简直是垃圾。  

I'm terrible at interviewing, and I've never done leetcode.  

我不擅长面试，而且我从来没有做过leetcode。  

This is not a brag; it's just not my style. Am I a nepo baby? I don't know. Was I a morale hire?  

这不是吹牛，这不是我的风格。我是一个nepo婴儿？我不知道我是一个士气雇佣？  

I'm pretty disagreeable. Was it merit? Also not sure.  

我很不讨人喜欢。这是优点吗？也不确定。

### Merit[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#merit "Permanent link")  

优点¶

Very few people get a job on merit alone. You have to be a big fish in a big pond.  

很少有人仅仅凭才干就得到一份工作。你必须是大池塘里的大鱼。  

That's like IOI, top 1% in your class, etc. That's just... Sort by grades and interview? That's hard.  

就像IOI，你班上的前1%，等等。那只是...按成绩和面试排序？这很难  

You literally have to be the best.  

你一定要做到最好。  

I say what I say knowing that you've already worked hard, knowing that you've already put in the sweat, but understanding that the next 10% or the next 5% of improvement is going to be much more difficult, than focusing on being a better person.  

我说我知道你已经努力工作了，知道你已经付出了汗水，但是要知道接下来的10%或5%的改进将比专注于成为一个更好的人要困难得多。  

And that I want you make a conscious of the trade-offs you make between these 'soft' and 'hard' skills.  

我希望你们能意识到在这些“软”和“硬”技能之间的权衡。

### High Agency[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#high-agency "Permanent link")  

高级代理¶

When I hire someone, I simply want to know that they are capable of taking charge of their own life.  

当我雇用一个人时，我只是想知道他们有能力掌控自己的生活。  

It's quite common for people to DM me saying, "Hey man, how can I help you?" However, I often find that they haven't put any effort into thinking about it.  

很常见的情况是，人们发短信给我说，“嘿，伙计，我能帮你什么吗？“但是，我经常发现他们没有花任何精力去思考它。  

I usually ignore such messages unless I truly believe they can provide assistance.  

我通常会忽略这些信息，除非我真的相信它们能提供帮助。

There have been many times people will DM me offering to help while I am writing a blog post.  

有很多次，人们会DM我提供帮助，而我写博客文章。  

I'll link the blog PR and say 'let me know what you think'. No comments, and then I get ghosted?  

我会链接博客公关，说'让我知道你的想法'。没意见，然后我就消失了？

How to Reach Out  

如何吸引男人

Do not send me anything longer than you would send to a crush.  

不要给我发任何比你发送给迷恋的东西更长的东西。  

Some people email me six-paragraph essays about the time they saved a cat from a tree.  

有些人给我发电子邮件，写一篇六段的文章，讲述他们从树上救下一只猫的经历。

I find the most effective way to get someone's attention is to simply give, just like in dating.  

我发现吸引别人注意力最有效的方法就是简单的给予，就像约会一样。  

Hey, I noticed that you read this book on your website.  

嘿，我注意到你在你的网站上读过这本书。  

I think you'd like this book too; it's pretty short, etc.  

我想你也会喜欢这本书的;它很短，等等。  

Oh, I noticed some tests were failing in your repository. I fixed them for you. Hey!  

哦，我注意到你的仓库里有一些测试失败了。我帮你修好了。嘿！嘿！  

I've added some examples to the codebase. Do you have any feedback?  

我在代码库中添加了一些示例。你有什么意见吗？

There are so many little ways to get people's attention that aren't self-centered.  

有很多小方法可以吸引人们的注意力，而不是以自我为中心。  

I do this with my consulting too.  

我的咨询也是这样。  

During the first call, my only goal is to tell you everything I think could help your business.  

在第一个电话中，我唯一的目标是告诉你我认为对你的生意有帮助的一切。  

I don't care if you hire me or not. I just want to help.  

我不在乎你雇不雇我。我只是想帮忙  

And as it turns out, this leads me to the next part.  

事实证明，这将我引向下一个部分。

I recognize that not everyone has access to the same networking opportunities, and the traditional job application process can be a valid and necessary path for many.  

我认识到，不是每个人都有机会获得同样的网络机会，传统的工作申请流程对许多人来说是一个有效和必要的途径。  

But social media when used correctly is a great way to get a opportunity  

但如果使用得当，社交媒体是获得机会的好方法

### Be the Plumber[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#be-the-plumber "Permanent link")  

成为水管工¶

When my toilet is overflowing with shit and my wife is about to come home in 2 hours, and I find a plumber, the plumber does not go, "OMG, thank you for this opportunity." They are past that.  

当我的厕所里满是大便，我妻子两个小时后就要回家的时候，我找到了一个水管工，水管工不会说，“天哪，谢谢你给我这个机会。”他们过去了。  

They know that you're in a pinch, and they know that what they have is valuable.  

他们知道你在紧要关头，他们知道他们所拥有的是有价值的。  

They know they are here to solve MY problem. Hiring is the same way.  

他们知道他们是来解决我的问题的。招聘也是一样。  

This is why people want to hire senior folks because there's some trust.  

这就是为什么人们想雇用资深人士，因为有一些信任。

![](30rock-kenneth.gif)

But ultimately, you have to understand that unless there's some tremendous tax break and positive EV, the people who are hiring NEED HELP.  

但最终，你必须明白，除非有一些巨大的税收减免和积极的EV，雇用的人需要帮助。  

Your job is to help them solve the problem or find the problem to solve.  

你的工作是帮助他们解决问题或找到问题来解决。  

You're here to solve my problem; you're not here to collect charity work.  

你是来解决我的问题的;不是来收慈善工作的。

### Be Someone People Want to Work With[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#be-someone-people-want-to-work-with "Permanent link")  

成为人们想与之共事的人¶

If your metric for working somewhere is being someone people want to work with, it turns out skill is not the highest metric.  

如果你在某个地方工作的衡量标准是成为人们想与之合作的人，那么技能并不是最高的衡量标准。  

I've seen people get hired because they're fun to be around.  

我见过有人因为有趣而被雇佣。  

If you want to be the smartest person, then yeah, good grades and being the smartest person in the room is a good metric.  

如果你想成为最聪明的人，那么是的，好成绩和成为房间里最聪明的人是一个很好的衡量标准。  

But if you want to get a job, "man, you're great to be around" is a very strong metric.  

但如果你想找份工作，“伙计，你很棒”是一个非常强的衡量标准。  

This is obviously conditional on skill, and you should obviously focus on skills acquisition.  

这显然是有条件的技能，你显然应该专注于技能的获取。

### Impostor Syndrome[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#impostor-syndrome "Permanent link")  

冒名顶替者综合征¶

If I hired you, don't insult me by having impostor syndrome.  

如果我雇了你，别拿骗子综合症来侮辱我。  

I hired you because I think you can solve my problem.  

我雇你是因为你能解决我的问题。  

I didn't hire you to compare you to other plumbers (I might), but at the end of the day, you must just think I have shit taste and that you've somehow tricked me into thinking you're good when you're an impostor? Right?  

我雇你不是为了把你和其他水管工比较（我可能会），但在一天结束的时候，你一定认为我的品味很差，你在某种程度上欺骗了我，让我认为你是个骗子时很好？对不对啊？

That said, it's advised that junior people seek out teams which prioritize a high degree of psychological safety.  

也就是说，建议年轻人寻找优先考虑高度心理安全的团队。

If you don't believe in yourself, believe in me that believes in you.  

如果你不相信自己，请相信你的我。

如何做好很多事情¶

I think too many people reading this are mostly pursuing intellectual activities, but I'm mostly gonna focus on using analogies of personal physical fitness to describe how I think about this kind of stuff.  

我想很多阅读这篇文章的人大多是在追求智力活动，但我主要是用个人身体健康的类比来描述我是如何看待这类事情的。

In the beginning, you're gonna have a noob gains, just an act of practicing is going to be enough to make improvements.  

在开始的时候，你会有一个新手的收获，只是一个练习的行为将是足以作出改进。  

You're gonna be so weak and out of shape that if you wait, it's gonna be cardio, and if you run, you're gonna get stronger.  

你会变得很虚弱，身材也不好，如果你等着，那就是有氧运动，如果你跑步，你会变得更强壮。

这将是几个月或几年的进步，只是出现在每一天，做任何事情。  

You're just gonna be making progress.  

你只是在进步。

### Cost of Being a Champion[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#cost-of-being-a-champion "Permanent link")  

成为冠军的代价¶

The story I tell myself is one where Travis Stevens talks about what it takes to be a judo champion.  

我告诉自己的故事是特拉维斯·史蒂文斯谈论成为柔道冠军需要什么。  

Something along the lines of "You think you want to be a champion until you meet someone who truly knows they want to be a champion." Replace "champion" with "comedian," "boxer," "founder," and so on.  

沿着“你认为你想成为一个冠军，直到你遇到一个人谁真正知道他们想成为一个冠军。把“冠军”换成“喜剧演员”、“拳击手”、“创始人”等等。

And if you lose, you have to refrain from making excuses.

That's incredibly challenging, and it's perfectly acceptable to choose not to pursue that path.  

这是非常具有挑战性的，选择不走这条路是完全可以接受的。

### Love Plateaus[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#love-plateaus "Permanent link")  

爱的高原¶

Once you start hitting a plateau, can you just start thinking about progressive overload and making sure what you're doing is facing difficulty at some consistent rate, but ultimately this is just to get you over and through some of these spots.  

一旦你开始达到一个平台，你能不能开始考虑渐进式超负荷，并确保你所做的是以某种一致的速度面临困难，但最终这只是让你通过这些点。  

At some point in the future, how much better you get will just be a function of how badly you want it and how much you enjoy the act.  

在未来的某个时候，你能得到多少好处，将取决于你有多渴望得到它，以及你有多享受这一行为。

How to identify the champ

训练结束后，我可以在游泳池里一口气游80米，并能屏住呼吸4分半钟。  

This was important because I knew that during my diving trip, the longest distance I would have to swim was 45 meters and the longest breath-hold would be 2 ½ minutes.

## Do It Scared[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#do-it-scared "Permanent link")

摆脱复杂性¶

也许很容易说服自己，一个好父亲能够照顾家庭，但有多少次，一个借口，只是工作自己的死亡是父亲谁可以支付钢琴课，真的是一个更好的人比父亲，谁可以出席独奏会？  

I just don't think this is something that we can turn on and off so easily.  

我只是不认为这是我们可以这么容易打开和关闭。

## Let Go of Anticipation[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#let-go-of-anticipation "Permanent link")  

放开期待¶

Here's a story about how regular people and Buddhist monks anticipated the future.  

这里有一个关于普通人和佛教僧侣如何预测未来的故事。  

They put both of them into an MRI and told them they were going to get shocked at some random time in the future.  

他们把两个人都放进核磁共振成像仪，告诉他们他们会在未来的某个随机时间受到电击。  

What they found was that regular people would have an anxious baseline response minutes before they were going to get shocked, but when they did, it was only slightly higher than the baseline.  

他们发现，普通人在受到电击前几分钟会有一个焦虑的基线反应，但当他们受到电击时，它只比基线略高。

The monks, however, had no resting anxious anticipatory response.  

然而，僧侣们没有休息焦虑的预期反应。  

There was no overactive brain activity until the moment of the shock.  

在电击之前没有过度活跃的大脑活动。  

But when they did feel the shock, it was much higher than the group of regular people.  

但是当他们真正感受到震动的时候，却要比普通人高出许多。  

They felt more pain!  

更痛了！

The lesson I learned from this is that anticipation likely dampens the sensations at the moment life happens, but at the cost dampening the joy as well, while creating a contraction in the present moment.  

我从中学到的教训是，期待可能会抑制生活发生时的感觉，但代价是也会抑制快乐，同时在当下创造一种收缩。  

This relates to the pessimism bit.  

这与悲观主义有关。  

You might think you're winning because you believe the pain was lessened by expecting the worse, but you also lose because you were in anticipation the entire time.  

你可能认为你赢了，因为你相信痛苦会因为预期更糟而减轻，但你也输了，因为你一直在预期。  

On the same token letting go of anticipation of success also allows you to enjoy the moment more, the pressure to succeed is equally a contraction.  

同样的道理，放下对成功的期待也会让你更享受当下，成功的压力同样是一种收缩。

## You were just a child[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#you-were-just-a-child "Permanent link")

## Attention is a Gift[¶](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#attention-is-a-gift "Permanent link")  

注意力是一份礼物¶

The most valuable thing you can give someone is your attention.  

你能给予别人的最有价值的东西就是你的注意力。  

Talk about the things you love, spend time with the people you love, and give your attention wisely.  

谈论你喜欢的事情，花时间和你爱的人在一起，明智地给予你的注意力。  

As I said before, grief is the result of unexpressed love, and the key to avoiding grief is to love abundantly, especially yourself.

So attend to the things that matter, and make sure to spend your arrogance while you're still young.  

所以，关注那些重要的事情吧，确保在你还年轻的时候，花掉你的傲慢。

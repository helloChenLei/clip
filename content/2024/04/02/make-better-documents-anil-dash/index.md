Whether it's resumes or reports, budgets or broadsides, I'm pretty regularly sent working documents from a wide range of people, and over the years I've noticed some consistent patterns that lead those documents to be less effective than they should be.  

无论是简历还是报告，无论是预算还是大字报，我经常会收到各种各样的人寄给我的工作文件，多年来，我注意到一些一致的模式，导致这些文件的效果大打折扣。  

Even very smart, capable communicators routinely send important documents that distract from, or even undermine, their goals.  

即使是非常聪明能干的沟通者，也会经常发送一些重要文件，从而分散甚至破坏他们的目标。

This isn't too surprising; we almost never actually teach people how to use the ordinary tools of business communication in more effective ways.  

这并不奇怪，因为我们几乎从未真正教过人们如何更有效地使用普通的商务交流工具。  

So, I'm gathering some advice that I regularly share with people, in hopes that this helps you get your messages across more effectively.  

因此，我收集了一些我经常与人分享的建议，希望能帮助你更有效地传递信息。  

All of this is advice that should apply regardless of whether you're using tools like Google Docs (uh... Workspace?), Microsoft Office (or 365 or something?) or whatever else.  

无论您使用的是 Google Docs（呃......Workspace？）、Microsoft Office（或 365 什么的？

## Know your audience and your goals  

了解受众和目标

The most common, and most serious, problem people have in creating documents is that they don't consider who they're speaking to and what they're trying to accomplish.  

人们在创建文档时最常见、也是最严重的问题是，他们没有考虑到他们的对话对象以及他们想要实现的目标。  

This can manifest in many ways, but most often the result is an end result that is technically not wrong (things like grammar and spelling may be correct, or the facts and figures may be accurate) but that is completely ineffective in achieving its goals.  

这可能表现在很多方面，但最常见的结果是，最终结果在技术上并没有错（语法和拼写可能是正确的，或者事实和数据可能是准确的），但在实现目标方面却完全无效。  

Ask yourself a few questions:  

问自己几个问题：

-   Who are you addressing with your document?  
    
    你的文件是发给谁的？
-   What is their day like, and what other distractions, concerns or priorities might they have?  
    
    他们的一天是怎样的？他们可能有哪些其他的分心事项、关注点或优先事项？
-   What's the most likely goal they are going to have, or answer they are trying to get, by looking at your work?  
    
    通过观察您的作品，他们最有可能达到的目标或试图得到的答案是什么？
-   What understanding do they have about your initial context and your own goals and needs?  
    
    他们对您最初的背景以及您自己的目标和需求有哪些了解？
-   What historical context are you assuming about the audience and how they'll see your message?  
    
    你假设受众的历史背景是什么，他们会如何看待你的信息？
-   Is the framing and narrative that you're using relevant and culturally appropriate to its intended audience?  
    
    您所使用的框架和叙述方式是否与目标受众相关，在文化上是否合适？
-   If you are asking for something, is it absolutely crystal clear that you are asking for something, and if there are options to choose from, are the options (along with their pros and cons) explictly laid out?  
    
    如果你有什么要求，你的要求是否绝对清楚；如果有什么选择，这些选择（及其利弊）是否明确列出？
-   If there's a decision involved, can you articulate which other parties may have a stake in that decision, and whether they've been consulted or not?  
    
    如果涉及到一项决定，你能否说明该决定可能与哪些其他方面有利害关系，以及是否征求过他们的意见？  
    
    Can you clearly articulate the counter-arguments to any answers you're proposing?  
    
    你能清楚地阐明你提出的任何答案的反驳理由吗？  
    
    Are those objections valid and legitimate?  
    
    这些反对意见是否合理合法？
-   If the document requires a response or a decision, have you identified a timeframe or a deadline for that decision, and explained why that timeline is relevant — both to you and to the intended audience?  
    
    如果文件要求作出回应或决定，您是否确定了作出决定的时间框架或最后期限，并 解释了为什么该时间框架与您和目标受众相关？

There are more questions in this vein, but what you'll find as a unifying thread amongst all these questions is starting from a standpoint of asking about empathy and perspective.  

类似的问题还有很多，但你会发现，所有这些问题的统一主线是从询问同理心和视角的角度出发的。  

If you don't do this, your output is a failure before it's even shared, but if you get most of these right, any gaps or shortcomings are likely to be addressed in a collaborative way, because the thought and care behind the work will be evident.  

如果你做不到这一点，你的成果在分享之前就已经失败了，但如果你能做好其中的大部分，任何差距或不足都有可能通过合作的方式得到解决，因为工作背后的思考和细心是显而易见的。

The most common failure cases I see in these kinds of situations is people starting from deep within their own heads, either because they've been fully immersed in a particular project, or because they're reacting to their own fears or concerns.  

在这种情况下，我看到的最常见的失败案例是人们从自己的内心深处出发，要么是因为他们已经完全沉浸在某个项目中，要么是因为他们对自己的恐惧或担忧做出了反应。  

(Even if those are legitimate!) I can't tell you how many times I've seen an important document, like a cover letter for a job, or a pitch for fundraising, that essentially starts with a lengthy, off-putting, deeply insular recitation of a list of things that are basically a litany of the author's insecurities.  

(即使这些都是合法的！）我不知道有多少次看到一份重要的文件，比如求职信或筹款申请书，开头就是冗长、令人反感、极度孤僻的事情清单，基本上就是作者的一连串不安全感。  

Don't do this!  

不要这样做

Start from common ground, identify the shared goal that you and your audience have, name the ways in which you're already on the path together, highlight what remains to be done, and then close by asking for their help (in whatever form) for you all to keep progressing on your collective goal.  

从共同点出发，确定你和受众的共同目标，说出你们已经在一起前进的方式，强调还有哪些工作要做，最后请求他们（以任何形式）提供帮助，以便你们在实现共同目标的道路上继续前进。

## Stop formatting everything to death  

停止格式化一切

This classic from [Joey Cherdarchuk at Dark Horse Analytics](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/clear-off-the-table) has been kicking around for a full decade, and I still end up sending it to someone about once a week.  

黑马分析公司的乔伊-切尔达丘克（Joey Cherdarchuk）的这篇经典文章已经流传了整整十年，我仍然每周都会给别人发一次。

![Dark Horse analytics provides a step-by-step set of instructions for removing common causes of clutter in formatting tables and spreadsheets](IMG_3448.gif)

If I had one bit of advice that I'd build into these tools, it would be this: **Stop overusing formatting!** Look at the formatting bar, and ignore almost all of the buttons. You can use bold, sparingly.  

如果我有一点建议，我想把它融入到这些工具中，那就是：停止过度使用格式化！看看格式栏，忽略几乎所有的按钮。你可以少用粗体。  

You can use italics, rarely. Just... never use underlines.  

你可以使用斜体，但很少。只是......永远不要使用下划线。  

Underlining basically only exists now to confuse people into thinking something is a link that they can click on.  

现在，下划线的存在基本上只是为了混淆视听，让人们以为某些东西是可以点击的链接。

The same goes for colors and fonts. Pick one, or _maybe_ two. For the entirety of your document or presentation.  

颜色和字体也是如此。选择一种，或者两种。用于整个文档或演示文稿。  

(Yes, including any charts and graphs.) You can use shades of one of the colors, if you absolutely have to.  

(是的，包括任何图表和图形。）如果万不得已，可以使用其中一种颜色的深浅搭配。  

But you don't! Do less. Be intentional about where you're applying any formatting, for any reason.  

但你没有！少做一点。无论出于什么原因，都要有意识地在哪里使用任何格式。

And finally: Don't use more than one of your formatting tools! **Bold** means something is important. _Italics_ means something is emphasized. Color means something is distinct.  

最后：不要使用一种以上的格式化工具！粗体表示重要内容。斜体表示某事被强调。彩色表示某些内容与众不同。  

Something that is bold, italicized, underlined, and brightly colored means you don't know what's important or what message you're trying to get across — it only communicates distraction.  

粗体、斜体、下划线和鲜艳的颜色意味着你不知道什么是重要的，或者你想传达什么信息--它只会分散你的注意力。  

And it's hard to read.  

而且很难读。

Oh, and don't put borders on anything.  

对了，不要在任何东西上加边界。  

If you can, remove and minimize the default borders that your tools put on things.  

如果可以，请移除并最小化工具在事物上设置的默认边框。  

"But then how will I separate stuff?!", you ask? This brings us to our next section...  

"你会问 "那我怎么把东西分开呢？这就引出了我们的下一节...

## White space  

白色空间

You know how all your designer friends are always talking about white space?  

你知道你的设计师朋友们总是在谈论留白吗？  

You basically can't have too much of it.  

基本上不能吃太多。  

Almost every time you want something to stand out, one of the best ways to do that is _not_ through lots of formatting, but through a smart use of white space.  

几乎每当你想让某样东西脱颖而出时，最好的方法之一不是通过大量的格式化，而是通过巧妙地使用留白。  

Done properly, the point you're making will stand out on its own.  

做得好的话，你要表达的观点本身就会很突出。  

Maybe you can just use a bit of minimal formatting to make it really pop, but it shouldn't take much.  

也许你可以使用一些最基本的格式来使它真正突出，但这并不需要太多。

A related technique is to **spray them with bullets**.  

一种相关的技术是向它们喷射子弹。  

Bullet points are a super powerful way to make content more skimmable for an audience, and perform a useful forcing function in making you edit your points down to be concise and roughly consistent.  

Bullet points 是一种超级强大的方法，能让内容更容易被受众略读，还能发挥有用的强制功能，让你把要点编辑得简明扼要、大致一致。  

One less-obvious benefit of using bullet points is that it can often reveal to you as an author whether the information that you're providing is all in the same category.  

使用要点的一个不太明显的好处是，作为作者，它往往能揭示你所提供的信息是否都属于同一类别。  

In prose, it can be easy to sometimes drift off-topic into unrelated topics, but with bullets, if you've got a list that has items which are very evidently out of place, it can be more evident.  

在散文中，有时很容易偏离主题，进入不相关的话题，但在子弹式标题中，如果你的列表中有一些项目非常明显地与主题不符，就会更加明显。

Conversely, only use images and illustrations with purpose. Clip art almost never adds value.  

相反，只使用有目的的图像和插图。剪贴画几乎从不增值。  

The same stock photos that came with your template are also meaningless. It is _far_ better to have white space on the screen for your audience than to fill up that space with a graphic that has no meaning, especially if it's not specific to your context or message.  

与你的模板一样的图片库照片也是毫无意义的。在屏幕上为受众留出空白空间，远比用毫无意义的图片来填充空白空间要好得多，尤其是在图片与你的背景或信息不相关的情况下。  

Visual noise has a huge cost in its impact on people being able to absorb and understand your message, and it's extraordinary how common it is for people to have a slide that is 1/3 really carefully-crafted points that took a long time to devise and 2/3 an image that has zero purpose and was added at the last minute.  

视觉噪音会影响人们吸收和理解你的信息，其代价是巨大的，人们经常会在幻灯片上看到 1/3 花了很长时间精心设计的要点，2/3 的图片没有任何目的，是在最后一刻添加的。  

Don't undermine your work with an unnecessary compulsion to fill up space just because a template suggests that you should.  

不要因为模板建议你填满空间，就不必要地强迫自己填满空间，这样会影响你的工作。

## Learn your tools  

学习工具

You should master the formatting tools (especially in written documents and slideshow presentations) that let you control spacing and margins around your content.  

你应该掌握格式设置工具（尤其是在书面文档和幻灯片演示中），这些工具可以让你控制内容的间距和边距。  

You can assign consistent styles (like headers in a document) to always have a lot of breathing room at the top, and then just consistently apply that style across your document.  

你可以指定一致的样式（如文档中的页眉），使顶部始终有很大的喘息空间，然后在整个文档中一致地应用该样式。

A really common anti-pattern that I often see is needless inconsistencies.  

我经常看到的一种非常常见的反模式就是不必要的不一致。  

For example, people will vary the size, color or emphasis of titles across different slides in a presentation.  

例如，人们会改变演示文稿中不同幻灯片标题的大小、颜色或重点。  

Sometimes, this is an artifact of their creation — slides with this font came from this team that was working together, but slides with this other font were copied from some older presentation.  

有时，这是他们创作的产物--使用这种字体的幻灯片来自这个合作团队，而使用另一种字体的幻灯片则是从某个较早的演示文稿中复制的。  

But to the _audience_, the immediate message that they'll take away from a difference in formatting on the title of a slide is, "There must be a reason this changed, let me understand its significance." Suddenly, your audience is trying to deduce the semantic meaning of a change that you didn't even make on purpose.  

但是，对于观众来说，他们从幻灯片标题格式的变化中得到的直接信息是："这个变化一定是有原因的，让我了解一下它的意义"。突然之间，你的受众正试图推断一个你根本不是故意做出的改变的语义。

The reason we start by saying to _stop formatting everything to death_ is that this then makes it much easier to catch the inevitable inconsistencies and errors in formatting that will arise when you tell a complex story.  

我们之所以一开始就说不要把所有东西都格式化得面目全非，是因为这样就更容易发现格式上不可避免的不一致和错误，而当你讲述一个复杂的故事时，格式上的不一致和错误就会出现。  

Audiences are sophisticated, and used to seeing highly-produced media, and are very skilled at the innate human habit of identifying changes in pattern and shape.  

观众是成熟的，习惯于观看制作精良的媒体，而且非常善于利用人类与生俱来的习惯来识别图案和形状的变化。  

So they will assume that any change in formatting over the course of a document has some purpose and intent behind it.  

因此，他们会认为文档中格式的任何变化都有其背后的目的和意图。  

If you don't anticipate this reality, you end up with the worst of both worlds — you've captured their attention with something that's not relevant, and emphasized your own lack of preparation.  

如果你没有预料到这一现实，你就会两败俱伤--你用无关紧要的东西吸引了他们的注意力，同时也强调了自己准备不足。

Learning your tools and using them well will make it easier to hide the seams between the different people and processes that created the work that you're sharing.  

学好并用好工具，就能更容易地掩盖不同人员和流程之间的缝隙，而正是这些人员和流程创造了你要分享的作品。  

And sweat the details here — if you're bringing over assets (like images, charts or embedded content) from other sources, make sure to use your tools to do another formatting pass and make it consistent with the rest of your document.  

如果您要从其他来源引入资产（如图片、图表或嵌入内容），请确保使用工具进行另一次格式化，使其与文档的其他部分保持一致。

## Pay attention to sequencing and order  

注意排序和顺序

Just as many documents begin by exposing the insecurities of their authors, many times the _order_ of information in a document reveals the relative difficulty of creating different kinds of content, rather than its actual importance.  

正如许多文件一开始就暴露了作者的不安全感一样，文件中的信息顺序很多时候也揭示了创建不同类型内容的相对难度，而不是其实际重要性。  

But people assume the first thing in a list is the most important!  

但人们总以为清单中的第一件事是最重要的！  

And they're being rational when they do so!  

他们这样做是理性的！

Especially in a world when some of the people attending your event, or participating in your meeting, will not have had time to review the whole thing in advance, assume that you have to front-load your key points at the beginning of the document.  

尤其是在一些参加活动或会议的人没有时间提前审阅整个文件的情况下，你必须在文件开头将重点放在前面。  

And within a particular page or slide, assume that you have to put the most pertinent info at the top, with supporting points below.  

在特定页面或幻灯片中，假定你必须把最相关的信息放在最上面，下面是辅助要点。  

If you're _not_ ordering things by importance (because you want to set up a chronological flow, or because you're organizing by some historical categorization you've inherited) _make that explicit in the text_ that your audience sees.  

如果你不是按照重要性来排序（因为你想按时间顺序排列，或者因为你是按照你所继承的某种历史分类来排序），请在你的受众所看到的文本中明确说明这一点。  

Otherwise half your audience will be lost right at the top, wondering in their minds why these items are in an inexplicable order.  

否则，你的一半受众就会在最前面迷失方向，心里想不明白为什么这些项目的顺序莫名其妙。

## It's not a murder mystery  

这不是谋杀之谜

Similar to the importance of sequencing and order, you almost always want to start by clearly and simply stating your conclusion, or declaring your request or question.  

与排序和顺序的重要性类似，你几乎总是希望在开头就简单明了地陈述你的结论，或者宣布你的请求或问题。  

Very often, people feel a lot of anxiety about the need to preface their big dramatic point with lots of build-up.  

很多时候，人们会因为需要在重大戏剧性事件之前做大量铺垫而感到焦虑不安。  

But you almost _never_ want to be building dramatic tension in a professional context; this isn't a thriller where you're trying to surprise them with twists and turns.  

但在专业领域，你几乎永远不会想制造戏剧性的紧张气氛；这不是一部惊悚片，你不会试图用曲折的情节给他们带来惊喜。

It's perfectly fine to open with a key question or conclusion, step back to walk through the logic and context that leads to that point, and then restate at the end to drive towards your goal.  

完全可以用一个关键问题或结论作为开场白，然后退后一步，通过逻辑和上下文来引出这一点，最后再重述一遍，以实现你的目标。  

But more often than not, if you don't set the stakes and make your point clear up top, you'll exhaust your audience, or leave them distracted trying to guess where you're headed all along the way.  

但通常情况下，如果你不在一开始就设定好赌注并明确自己的观点，你就会让听众筋疲力尽，或者让他们心不在焉地猜测你一路走来的方向。

Similarly, _put the important points on the page_!  

同样，把重要的内容放在页面上！  

It's absolutely astounding how often people will take the most important conclusion about their work, or the most vital bit of context needed to make a decision, and assume they'll speak to it alongside the presentation of the document or slides.  

人们经常会把工作中最重要的结论，或者做出决定所需的最重要的背景信息，假定自己会在介绍文件或幻灯片时一并说出来，这绝对令人震惊。  

This is a surefire way to ensure that one of your most important stakeholders will be absent or distracted, and completely miss your point, and then go back and look at your document and not see that key fact you were trying to share.  

这是确保你最重要的利益相关者之一缺席或分心的一个万无一失的方法，他们会完全错过你的观点，然后回过头来看你的文件，却看不到你试图分享的关键事实。  

Even in many cases when people _do_ include the key point, it's very often buried in some obscure place like the speakers' notes on a slide, or in an appendix that doesn't seem like a central part of the document.  

即使在很多情况下，人们确实包含了关键点，但它往往被埋没在一些不起眼的地方，比如幻灯片上的演讲者注释，或者看起来并不像文件核心部分的附录中。  

Don't demote your central statement to an ancillary channel.  

不要把你的中心声明降格为辅助渠道。

## Give people wayfinding  

为人们指路

People want to know where they're at in the story.  

人们想知道自己在故事中的位置。  

This doesn't have to be fancy, you don't need a full timeline bar like a YouTube video.  

这不需要太花哨，也不需要像 YouTube 视频那样有一个完整的时间轴栏。  

But a quick outline of progress (and, if you've got a particularly long document, recapping your position in that outline as you go) can help ensure people that they understand their place in the overall conversation.  

但是，快速概述进展情况（如果你的文件特别长，可以边概述边重申你的立场）有助于确保人们了解自己在整个对话中的位置。

This is one of those rare places where you may well _want_ to use color.  

在这种罕见的情况下，您很可能需要使用色彩。  

If you've got multiple distinct sections of a document or presentation, assign colors to them (keep your palette limited!) and use them utterly consistently so people know where they are, and that'll help build confidence that your audience knows how far along they are in the story.  

如果您的文档或演示文稿有多个不同的部分，请为它们指定颜色（调色板要有限！），并始终如一地使用它们，这样人们就会知道他们在哪里，这将有助于建立信心，让听众知道他们在故事的哪个部分。

Similarly, summarize any data that you present.  

同样，对您提交的任何数据进行总结。  

You can trust people to be smart and to dig into numbers or charts, but start them off on the right foot with a little bit of "here's what these data show" right in the title of your chart or figure or data table, so they're mentally in the right place to absorb the more dense or inaccessible information.  

你可以相信人们会很聪明，会钻研数字或图表，但在图表或数字或数据表的标题中，先告诉他们 "这些数据显示了什么"，这样他们就会有一个正确的开始，从而吸收更密集或更难以获取的信息。

## Ask answerable questions  

提出可回答的问题

An absolutely vital requirement, especially for documents or presentations that are driving towards a particular goal: Ask questions that are _answerable_.  

一个绝对重要的要求，尤其是对于那些旨在实现特定目标的文件或演示文稿：提出可以回答的问题。  

This sounds like an absurd contraint, but the actual absurdity is how often you'll see a giant headline on a slide that asks something like, "How can we do better?" That's a philosophical debate, not a prompt for an organization to make a choice!  

这听起来像是一个荒谬的限制，但实际荒谬之处在于，你经常会在幻灯片上看到一个巨大的标题，提出类似 "我们如何才能做得更好？"的问题。这是一场哲学辩论，而不是促使组织做出选择！

One thing I've learned from being a parent is that constraining choice is a great way to get unstuck; unsurprisingly, the same tactic that works on 3-year-olds is very effective in board meetings.  

作为家长，我学到的一点是，限制选择是摆脱困境的好办法；毫不奇怪，这种对 3 岁儿童有效的策略在董事会会议上也非常有效。  

Rather than "what do you want for dinner?" (Inevitable answer, "I don't know, what do you want?") you can ask someone "Do you want spaghetti or chicken nuggets?" and even a 3-year-old will suddenly have a much more constructive answer.  

与其问 "你晚饭想吃什么？"（必然的答案是 "我不知道，你想吃什么？"），不如问 "你想吃意大利面还是鸡块？"，即使是 3 岁的孩子，也会突然有一个更有建设性的答案。

Similarly, you'll want to constrain your requests to your audience to be something they can react to constructively.  

同样，你也要限制向受众提出的要求，让他们能够做出建设性的反应。  

"Do we want to invest at the higher cost of Option A to move faster, or go with the lower cost of Option B to be more cautious?" That's an answerable question!  

"我们是选择成本较高的方案 A 进行投资以加快发展，还是选择成本较低的方案 B 进行投资以更加谨慎？这是一个可以回答的问题！  

And it's perfectly fine if it leads to a conversation where a third option is explored — but you never would have gotten there with a prompt that says, "What do we want to do next?"  

如果这能引发一场对话，探讨第三种选择，那就再好不过了--但如果提示说 "我们下一步想做什么？"，你就永远不会有这样的结果。

## Close by reiterating your mission and goals  

最后重申你的使命和目标

You can never go wrong by restating first principles in the closing of your message.  

在信息结尾处重申首要原则，永远不会出错。  

Remind people about alignment on purpose, and ideally alignment on values.  

提醒人们注意目标一致，最好是价值观一致。  

This sets up for a constructive conversation, and clarifies the priorities that you all share in having a dialogue in the first place.  

这就为建设性对话做好了准备，并明确了大家在对话中的共同优先事项。  

You'll never go wrong thanking your audience or reminding them about past collaborative successes, either.  

向受众表示感谢或提醒他们过去的合作成果也不会有错。

If your goal is to persuade, this gives your audience psychological permission to believe that you have their best interests in mind, too.  

如果你的目标是说服，那么这就从心理上允许你的受众相信你也是为他们的最大利益着想。  

If your goal is to make a tough decision, this gives them courage to go forward knowing that you'll be alongside them in their choice.  

如果你的目标是让他们做出艰难的决定，这就会给他们勇气，让他们知道你会和他们一起做出选择。  

If your goal is to inform, they'll feel more comfortable asking clarifying questions when you remind them that you're sincere in wanting to share your story.  

如果你的目的是提供信息，那么当你提醒他们你是真诚地想分享你的故事时，他们会更愿意问一些澄清性的问题。

That's it!  

就是这样！  

Good luck making better documents, and just pretend that the underline button in your apps doesn't even exist anymore.  

祝你好运，制作出更好的文档，就当应用程序中的下划线按钮已经不存在了。

## Bonus Update: Name things right!  

奖励更新：正确命名！

(Thanks to [Waldo Jaquith](https://mastodon.social/@waldoj/112068896740732098) for the reminder to add this one!)  

(感谢 Waldo Jaquith 提醒我们加上这一条！）。

One of the most important types of information you can share in a document is _the title of the document itself_.  

在文档中可以共享的最重要信息之一就是文档标题本身。  

But so often, names are either just default generated titles, or reflect a lack of thought about context for the file.  

但很多时候，名称要么只是默认生成的标题，要么反映出对文件的上下文缺乏考虑。

Like we said to start, you need to start by thinking about the context of your intended audience.  

正如我们在开始时所说的，首先要考虑目标受众的背景。  

What are the words they'll use to search their email to find the file in the future.  

他们将来在搜索电子邮件时会使用哪些词语来查找文件。  

For example, you _don't_ want to lead with the name (or the company/organization name) of your intended audience most of the time!  

例如，在大多数情况下，您不希望以目标受众的姓名（或公司/组织名称）作为开头！  

If you're talking to someone at another company or organization, they'll try to retrieve a document by searching for the name of you or your organization, so include that in the title.  

如果您在与其他公司或组织的人交谈，他们会尝试通过搜索您或您组织的名称来检索文件，因此请在标题中包含这一点。  

If you're all on the same team, include the context of the project or initiative you're working on, and the specific goal you're working toward.  

如果你们都在同一个团队，请说明你们正在开展的项目或计划的背景，以及你们正在努力实现的具体目标。

Similarly, you'll want to briefly include the date and a summary of the topic being covered in the document.  

同样，您还需要在文件中简要注明日期和所涉及主题的摘要。  

This advice even extends to meeting invitations — inviting Sam to a meeting called "Meeting with Sam" is only going to create a useless or confusing entry on their calendar.  

这个建议甚至还适用于会议邀请--邀请山姆参加一个名为 "与山姆会面 "的会议，只会在他们的日历上留下一个无用或混乱的条目。  

Think through how they'll be referring to the conversation, and name the meeting after that context.  

想一想他们会如何提及这次谈话，并根据这一背景为会议命名。  

Then name the document after the purpose of the meeting.  

然后根据会议目的为文件命名。

Finally, for versioning, sequential numbers are almost never sufficient on their own.  

最后，对于版本管理来说，序列号本身几乎是不够的。  

(And needless to say, appending `_final_final` to a document is... not going to produce the results you'd hope for.) Pick a naming convention that includes some kind of version context like dates right in the name, and it'll be much easier for your audience to know if they've got the most recent version.  

(不用说，将 `_final_final` 添加到文档中......不会产生你所希望的结果）。选择一个包含某种版本上下文（如名称中的日期）的命名惯例，会让你的受众更容易知道他们得到的是否是最新版本。

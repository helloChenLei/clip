“To see takes time, like to have a friend takes time.”  

"看见需要时间，就像拥有一个朋友需要时间"  

_–Georgia O’Keeffe  

乔治亚-奥基夫_  

\*

Someone at the dinner table wanted to know what everyone’s turning point on climate was, which is to say she wanted us to tell a story with a pivotal moment.  

饭桌上有人想知道大家在气候问题上的转折点是什么，也就是说，她想让我们讲一个有关键时刻的故事。  

She wanted sudden; all I had was slow, the story of a journey with many steps, gradual shifts, accumulating knowledge, concern, and commitment.  

她想要的是突然的，而我有的只是缓慢的，是一个由许多步骤、逐渐转变、知识积累、关注和承诺组成的旅程的故事。  

A lot had happened but it had happened in many increments over a few decades, not via one transformative anything.  

虽然发生了很多事情，但都是在几十年的时间里循序渐进地发生的，而不是通过一次变革。

People love stories of turning points, wake-up calls, sudden conversions, breakthroughs, the stuff about changes that happen in a flash.  

人们喜欢转折点、警钟、突然转变、突破的故事，喜欢瞬间发生的变化。  

Movies love them as love at first sight, dramatic speeches that change everything, trouble that can be terminated by shooting one bad guy, and other easy fixes and definitive victories.  

电影喜欢一见钟情、改变一切的戏剧性演说、射杀一个坏人就能解决的麻烦，以及其他简单的解决方法和决定性的胜利。  

Old-school radicals love them as the kind of revolution that they imagine will change everything suddenly, even though a change of regime isn’t a change of culture and consciousness.  

老派激进分子喜欢这种革命，他们想象革命会突然改变一切，尽管政权更迭并不是文化和意识的改变。

Maybe religion loves them too, as conversion, revelation, and sudden awakening.  

也许宗教也喜欢它们，将其视为皈依、启示和突然的觉醒。

Saul falls off his horse with the strength of his revelation and gets up as St.  

扫罗在启示的力量下从马背上摔下来，然后像圣保罗一样站起来。  

Paul, the Buddha gets enlightened in one intense session under the Bo Tree, Muhammed gets a visit from the Angel Gabriel—but at least with the latter two, the story has to include the long journey of intention and exploration leading to the sudden event.  

但至少在后两者的故事中，故事必须包括导致这一突发事件的漫长的意向和探索旅程。  

I love dramatic stories too, but I think they tend to mislead us about how change happens.  

我也喜欢戏剧性的故事，但我认为它们往往会误导我们，让我们不知道变化是如何发生的。

I’ve found in my twenty-something years of messing about with Buddhism is that what it has to teach is pretty simple; you could read up on the essentials in a day, probably in an hour, possibly in a quarter of an hour.  

在我二十多年的佛学生涯中，我发现佛学教导的东西非常简单；你可以在一天内，可能是一小时内，也可能是一刻钟内读完佛学要义。  

But the point is to somehow so deeply embed those values, perspectives, and insights in yourself that they become reflexive, your operating equipment, how you assess and react to the world around you.  

但问题的关键在于，你要以某种方式将这些价值观、观点和见解深深地植入自己的内心，使它们成为你的操作设备，成为你评估和应对周围世界的方式。  

That’s the work of a lifetime—or of many, if you’re inclined to believe in reincarnation.  

这是一生的工作--如果你倾向于相信轮回的话，这也是许多人一生的工作。

Most truths are like that, easy to hear or recite, hard to live in the sense that slowness is hard for most of us, requiring commitment, perseverance, and return after you stray.  

大多数真理都是如此，听起来或背诵起来很容易，但生活起来却很难，因为对我们大多数人来说，慢是很难的，需要承诺、毅力和迷失后的回归。  

Because the job is not to know; it’s to become.  

因为工作不是去了解，而是去成为。  

A sociopath knows what kindness is and how to weaponize it; a saint becomes it.  

反社会者知道什么是仁慈，以及如何将仁慈武器化；而圣人则成为仁慈。

We are impatient creatures, impatient for the future to arrive and prone to forgetting the past in our urgency to have it all now.  

我们是没有耐心的动物，急于等待未来的到来，在急于拥有现在的一切时容易忘记过去。

We need stories in which getting where you’re going—individually or as a society—mostly happens step by step with maybe some backsliding, muddle, and stalling, not via one great leap.  

我们需要这样的故事，在故事中，你要去的地方--无论是个人还是社会--大多是一步一步发生的，也许会有一些倒退、糊涂和停滞，而不是通过一次大的飞跃。  

Maybe this is the task at which novels and biographies excel.  

也许这正是小说和传记所擅长的。

In the scope of a substantial novel is room for someone to grow up, to change, to learn, for Pip to come to understand how his love for Estella was all tied up in other people’s suffering and his own upward-mobility ambitions and class shame, for Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy to see that their own first impressions were mistakes born of hubris and fall in love with each other, for the nun at the beginning of _Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse_ to undergo extraordinary transformations, heal others, find and lose love, and grow old, for the formation of characters, the building and tearing down of relationships, the arrival of those revelations that can only arrive slowly.  

在一部内容充实的小说中，有人可以成长、改变、学习，皮普可以明白他对埃斯特拉的爱是如何与他人的痛苦、自己的上进心和阶级耻辱联系在一起的，伊丽莎白-贝内特和菲茨威廉-达西可以看到他们自己的第一印象是因自负而产生的错误，并彼此相爱、小无马奇迹的最后报告》开头的修女经历了非同寻常的转变，治愈了他人，找到并失去了爱情，慢慢变老，人物形象的塑造、关系的建立和破坏，以及那些只能慢慢到来的启示的到来。

Anyone who’s gotten over a heartbreak or a bereavement knows that there aren’t five stages of grief you pass through like they were five whistlestop towns on the train route.  

经历过心碎或丧亲之痛的人都知道，悲伤的五个阶段并不像火车路线上的五个小站那样一晃而过。  

You are more this way one day and more that way the other, looping and regressing, and maybe building reconciliation or acceptance like a log cabin while living in sorrow, rather than sliding into it like you were stealing third base.  

你今天这样，明天那样，循环往复，也许会像木屋一样在悲伤中建立起和解或接受，而不是像抢三垒一样滑入悲伤。

You want tomorrow to be different than today, and it may seem the same, or worse, but next year will be different than this one, because those tiny increments added up.  

你希望明天与今天不同，而明天可能看起来一样，或者更糟，但明年会与今年不同，因为那些微小的增量加在一起。  

The tree today looks a lot like the tree yesterday, and so does the baby.  

今天的树和昨天的树很像，孩子也是。  

A lot of change is undramatic growth, transformation, or decay, or rather its timescale means the drama might not be perceptible to the impatient.  

很多变化都是不具戏剧性的成长、转变或衰败，或者说其时间尺度意味着戏剧性可能不会被没有耐心的人察觉。

And we are impatient creatures, impatient for the future to arrive and prone to forgetting the past in our urgency to have it all now, and sometimes too impatient to learn the stories of how what is best in our era was made by long, slow campaigns of change.  

我们是没有耐心的动物，对未来的到来没有耐心，容易在急于拥有一切的时候忘记过去，有时也太没有耐心了，不知道我们这个时代最好的东西是如何通过漫长而缓慢的变革运动创造出来的。  

Martin Luther King Jr.  

小马丁-路德-金有一句名言  

famously said that “the arc of history is long but it bends toward justice,” but whichever way it bends you have to be able to see the arc (and I’m pretty sure by arc he meant a gradual curve, not an acute angle as if history suddenly took a sharp left).  

马丁-路德-金有一句名言："历史的弧线很长，但它是向着正义弯曲的。"但无论它向哪个方向弯曲，你都必须能够看到它的弧线（我很确定他所说的弧线是指渐进的曲线，而不是一个锐角，就好像历史突然向左急转弯一样）。  

Sometimes seeing it is sudden, because change has been going on all along but you finally recognize it.  

有时候，看到弧线是很突然的，因为变化一直在进行，但你终于意识到了。

The expectation that change will be swift and the failure to perceive it when it’s not impacts politics for the worse.  

人们期望变革会一蹴而就，而当变革没有发生时，却又无法察觉，这对政治的影响越来越大。

Maybe you’ve had those moments when you suddenly see that someone you love has changed in condition or character, and your picture of them is out of date, or those moments when someone absent for months or years reappears and points out a change to a person or place or system unseen by those who adjusted to without perceiving tiny increments of change that added up.  

也许你曾有过这样的经历：你突然发现自己所爱的人在状态或性格上发生了变化，而你对他的印象已经过时了；也许你曾有过这样的经历：某个缺席数月或数年的人再次出现，并指出某个人、某个地方或某个系统发生了变化，而这些变化是那些没有察觉到细微变化的人所没有看到的。  

But the change itself wasn’t sudden.  

但变化本身并不突然。

The expectation that change will be swift and the failure to perceive it when it’s not impacts politics for the worse.  

人们期望变化会很快，而当变化并不突然时，人们却无法察觉，这对政治的影响越来越坏。  

A common source of uninformed despair is when a too-brief effort doesn’t bring a desired result—one round of campaigning, one protest.  

当过于短暂的努力没有带来预期的结果--一轮竞选、一次抗议--成为不明真相的绝望的常见根源。  

Or when one loss becomes the basis for someone to decide winning is impossible and quitting—as if you tossed a coin once and decided it always comes up tails.  

或者，当一次失利成为某人认定不可能获胜并放弃的依据时--就好像你抛了一次硬币，然后认定它总是正面。

Another immense impact of this impatience and attention-span deficit comes when a political process reaches its end, but too many don’t remember its  beginning.  

当政治进程走到尽头，却有太多的人不记得它的开始时，这种不耐烦和注意力缺失就会产生另一种巨大的影响。  

At the end of most positive political changes, a powerful person or group seems to hand down a decision.  

在大多数积极的政治变革结束时，一个有权势的人或团体似乎会下达一个决定。  

But at the beginning of most were grassroots campaigns to make it happen.  

但在大多数变革的开端，都是基层民众为实现变革而发起的运动。  

The change got handed up before it got handed down, and only the slow perspective, the long view, lets you see the power that lies in ordinary people, in movements, in campaigns that often are seen as unrealistic, extreme, aiming for the impossible at their inception.  

只有从慢处着眼，从长计议，你才能看到普通人、运动、运动中蕴藏的力量，而这些运动在开始时往往被视为不切实际、极端、以不可能为目标。

The best movie I’ve ever seen about this is a 2022 documentary called _To the End_.  

在这方面，我看过的最好的电影是 2022 年的一部纪录片《进行到底》。  

It traces the creation of the Sunrise Movement—the US climate organization for people under 30, started in 2018—and their launch of the Green New Deal, showing how it influenced the Biden campaign’s climate platform, deserves credit for Build Back Better, and finally—yes, in reduced and compromised form, but still—crossed the finish line in 2022.  

这部纪录片追溯了 "日出运动"（Sunrise Movement）的创建过程--这个美国 30 岁以下年轻人的气候组织始于 2018 年，他们发起了 "绿色新政"（Green New Deal），展示了该运动如何影响拜登竞选团队的气候纲领，如何为 "建设得更好"（Build Back Better）立下汗马功劳，以及最终--是的，虽然形式有所缩减和妥协，但仍然--在 2022 年跨过了终点线。

“People who do nothing, people who have not even canvassed or anything, they start critiquing your strategy to win.”  

"那些无所事事的人，那些甚至没有拉过票或做过任何事情的人，他们开始批评你的获胜策略"。

That is, by taking a five-year time frame it shows how what ended up as a piece of legislation began as young idealists dreaming of change, and by tracing that trajectory shows that young people, grassroots campaigns, and radical new ideas can have power.  

也就是说，通过五年的时间框架，它展示了最终成为一项立法的内容是如何从梦想变革的年轻理想主义者开始的，并通过追踪这一轨迹展示了年轻人、草根运动和激进的新思想可以产生力量。  

The short-term version gives you politicians giving us nice things.  

短期版本让你看到政客们给我们带来的好处。  

The long-term version shows you movements shifting what’s considered possible, reasonable, and necessary, setting the stage and creating the pressure for these events, offering a truer analysis of power.  

而长期版本则展示了运动改变了人们所认为的可能、合理和必要，为这些事件创造了舞台和压力，提供了对权力更真实的分析。

\*

There’s a wonderful scene in _To the End_ in which Alex O’Keefe, then creative director of the Sunrise Movement, declares as he unloads a station wagon, “People who do nothing, people who have not even canvassed or anything, they start critiquing your strategy to win.  

在《走到尽头》中有一个精彩的场景，时任 "日出运动 "创意总监的亚历克斯-奥基夫（Alex O'Keefe）在卸下一辆旅行车时宣称："那些无所事事的人，那些甚至没有拉过票或做过任何事情的人，他们开始批评你的获胜策略。  

‘But how are you gonna win, what’s your strategy, is it realistic, can we win?’ Who cares if we can win, man?  

'但你要怎么赢，你的战略是什么，现实吗，我们能赢吗？"谁在乎我们能不能赢，伙计？  

We’re just unpacking boxes. You do things step by step.”  

我们只是在拆箱子。你得一步一步来"。

His patient commitment reminds me of Greta Thunberg’s famous 2019 [declaration](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time) “Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking.  

他耐心的承诺让我想起了格丽塔-图恩伯格在 2019 年发表的著名宣言："避免气候崩溃需要大教堂式的思维。  

We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” It’s an analysis that says, as I understand it, two important things.  

我们必须打好地基，而我们可能还不清楚如何建造天花板"。据我所知，这一分析说明了两件重要的事情。  

One is that addressing the climate crisis is a longterm project calling for many kinds of labor.  

其一，应对气候危机是一项长期工程，需要多种劳动。  

The other is that we must work toward a post-fossil-fuel world knowing that the solutions continue to evolve—for example solar and wind were expensive, wholly inadequate technologies early in the millennium and are now cheap, effective, and being implemented at a dizzying rate while battery storage and materials are evolving at dazzling speed.  

例如，太阳能和风能在千禧年初还是昂贵、完全不适用的技术，而现在已经变得廉价、有效，并以令人眼花缭乱的速度得到应用，同时电池存储和材料也在以令人眼花缭乱的速度发展。

In this lies the secret of why, if you crave suddenness or can’t keep your eye on the slow, destruction seems exciting, construction boring.  

这就是为什么如果你渴望突如其来，或者不能盯着缓慢的发展，破坏就会显得令人兴奋，建设就会显得无聊的秘密所在。  

Of course there’s slow destruction and what the environmental historian Rob Nixon called “slow violence”—the decline of wildlife populations, the destabilization of the seasons, the dismantling of the progressive economies of the mid-twentieth century.  

当然，还有缓慢的破坏，以及环境历史学家罗伯-尼克松所说的 "缓慢的暴力"--野生动物数量的减少、季节的不稳定、20 世纪中期进步经济的瓦解。  

These catastrophes are often too gradual for those with no clear baseline or long attention span or strong news summary to perceive—literally they’re not new enough for news.  

这些灾难往往过于渐进，对于那些没有明确基线、关注时间较长或新闻摘要较强的人来说，根本无法察觉--确切地说，对于新闻来说，它们还不够新。

For climate this means that the metabolic tendencies of news is often ideally suited to tell you that something sudden and maybe unanticipated happened last night—a flood, a fire—and it was bad.  

对气候而言，这意味着新闻的新陈代谢倾向通常非常适合于告诉你昨晚发生了什么突如其来的、也许是意料之外的事情--洪水、火灾--而且情况很糟糕。  

A lot of climate good news is both wonky—a technology breakthrough or a regulation passed that will eventually have positive consequences—or incremental.  

很多气候方面的好消息都是不确定的--一项技术突破或一项最终会产生积极影响的法规获得通过--或者是渐进的。

Describing the slowness of change is often confused with acceptance of the status quo.  

描述变化的缓慢往往与接受现状相混淆。  

It’s really the opposite: an argument that the status quo must be changed, and it will take steadfast commitment to see the job through.  

其实，这恰恰相反：这是一种必须改变现状的论点，而且需要坚定不移地坚持到底。  

It’s not accepting defeat; it’s accepting the terms of possible victory.  

这不是接受失败，而是接受可能胜利的条件。  

Distance runners pace themselves; activists and movements often need to do the same, and to learn from the timelines of earlier campaigns to change the world that have succeeded.  

长跑运动员要把握好自己的节奏；活动家和运动通常也需要这样做，并从早期成功改变世界的运动的时间表中汲取经验。

To be able to see change is to be able to make change.  

能够看到变化就是能够做出改变。  

I’m an advocate for slowness, not in the sense of dragging your feet or delaying your reaction but in the sense of scaling your perception to to perceive the events unfolding, because I’m an advocate for making change.  

我主张慢，不是说拖拖拉拉或迟迟不做出反应，而是说要扩大自己的感知范围，以感知正在发生的事件，因为我主张做出改变。

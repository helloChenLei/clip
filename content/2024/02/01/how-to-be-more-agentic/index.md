I often hear agency talked about as if it’s an inherent trait: Either someone has it or they don’t -- in which case, too bad, they’re doomed to a life in the minor leagues.  

我经常听到有人谈论 "代理"，好像它是与生俱来的特质：要么有，要么没有--如果没有，那就太糟糕了，他们注定要在小联盟中度过一生。  

This hasn’t been my experience.  

我的经历并非如此。  

Over the years, as I’ve gradually grown dumber relative to my peers through a combination of aging and making smarter friends, one of the main ways I’ve compensated has been through dialing up my agency, which I think of as something like “manifest determination to make things happen.”  

多年来，随着年龄的增长和结交更聪明的朋友，我逐渐变得比同龄人笨，我补偿自己的主要方式之一就是提高自己的能力，我认为这就是 "让事情发生的明显决心"。

As a result, I’ve done a bunch of cool stuff in different domains: I was a Supreme Court advocate and the number one female poker player in the world; started art and perfume companies; and led operations at Alvea, a pandemic medicine company I co-founded, when it set the record for the fastest startup to take a drug to clinical trials.  

因此，我在不同领域做了很多很酷的事情：我曾是最高法院的辩护律师，也是世界排名第一的女扑克牌手；创办过艺术品公司和香水公司；还领导过我共同创办的大流行病医药公司 Alvea 的运营，该公司当时创下了初创公司最快将药物推向临床试验的纪录。  

All of these things I did in my 30s.  

所有这些事情，我都是在 30 多岁时做的。

In my way of thinking, radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant.  

按照我的思维方式，激进代理就是要找到真正的优势：你愿意做别人不愿意做的事情，往往是因为这些事情令人讨厌或不愉快。  

These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually这些并不总是在意识中浮现，以至于人们实际上 _choosing选择_ \-- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.  

\-- 他们往往生活在厌恶的阴云中，从战略上掩盖了权衡的结果。

The idea of finding real edges, as contrasted with “eking out wins by grinding harder than everyone,” first clicked for me when I started playing poker.  

寻找真正的优势，与 "通过比别人更刻苦的努力来勉强获胜 "形成鲜明对比，这个想法在我开始玩扑克时第一次被点燃。  

Poker in the modern era is an extraordinarily competitive game, and even 8 years ago pros were spending nearly as much time studying as they were playing, using solver models to seek out tiny mathematical advantages.  

现代扑克是一种竞争异常激烈的游戏，即使在 8 年前，职业玩家也会花费几乎与打牌一样多的时间来研究，使用求解器模型来寻找微小的数学优势。  

At the same time, a massive edge was available in the form of physical reads, but almost entirely ignored.  

与此同时，大量的优势以物理读取的形式存在，但几乎完全被忽视。  

(I know an example would make this more compelling, but I’m sorry, it’s like explaining a magic trick.)  

(我知道举个例子会更有说服力，但对不起，这就像解释魔术一样）。

Two friends and I maniacally studied reads together, and we all had out-of-distribution results.  

我和两个朋友一起疯狂地研究读数，我们都得到了超出分布范围的结果。  

But when we’d tell other pros what we were doing, the response from most was “nuh-uh, that’s not a thing.” They weren’t willing to consider the possibility that reads were valuable, maybe because they didn’t want to feel obligated to study them.  

但当我们告诉其他专业人士我们在做什么时，大多数人的反应都是 "不不不，这不可能"。他们不愿意考虑 "阅读是有价值的 "这种可能性，也许是因为他们不想觉得自己有义务去研究它们。

All of my agency hacks are kind of like this, in my opinion -- big, glaring edges that people might rather ignore.  

在我看来，我所有的代理黑客都是这样的--大而明显的边缘，人们可能宁愿忽略它们。

Ask for things. Ask for things that feel _unreasonable_, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process).  

提出要求。要求一些感觉不合理的事情，以确保你对什么是合理的直觉是准确的（当然，在这个过程中尽量不要做一个混蛋）。  

If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough.  

如果你只要求得到的东西，那你的目标就不够高。  

Jobs are a great example: Particularly if you’re early in your career, you should aim to get rejected from most things you apply for.  

工作就是一个很好的例子：特别是如果你处于职业生涯的初期，你的目标应该是申请的大多数工作都被拒绝。  

If you have not yet learned the skill of absorbing rejection,如果你还没有学会吸收拒绝的技巧、 [court it deliberately  

自作主张](https://youtu.be/-vZXgApsPCQ?si=Rj0FbacsSp34a-W2): Apply for some jobs you:申请一些工作 _really的确_ don’t think you’ll get so you can learn to decouple “no” from surprise and dejection.  

这样你就能学会将 "不 "与惊讶和沮丧分离开来。

I sent an email recently that I wouldn’t have dared try a few years ago, something along the lines of “I’m planning to start an organization similar to yours; would you consider letting me run yours instead?” The response? Crickets.  

最近，我发了一封几年前不敢发的邮件，内容大致是："我打算成立一个与你们类似的组织，你们能考虑让我来管理你们的组织吗？结果呢？蛐蛐。  

Maybe that person thinks I overstepped.  

也许那个人认为我越权了。  

But it doesn’t matter, because a similar pitch delivered to someone else put us on a path to start a new organization together, something much cooler than I could have managed on my own.  

但这并不重要，因为向别人提出类似的建议，让我们走上了共同创办新组织的道路，这比我一个人经营要酷得多。

It’s hard to overstate how overpowered this one is.  

这个功能有多强大，怎么说都不为过。  

If you aren’t trying to get real feedback from people who know you, you’re cooking without tasting.  

如果你不试图从了解你的人那里获得真实的反馈，你就等于没有品尝就开始烹饪。  

This is, like, the lowest hanging fruit for self-improvement, but few people really try to pick it.  

这就像是自我提升的最低悬挂果实，但很少有人真正尝试去摘取它。

In many contexts, the way to get good feedback is to give people a way to provide it anonymously.  

在许多情况下，获得良好反馈的方法是让人们匿名提供反馈。  

Anything else creates friction by layering on social dynamics.  

其他任何事情都会通过增加社会动力来制造摩擦。  

To get honest feedback, you want to make it as comfortable as possible for people to give it.  

要想得到真实的反馈，就必须让人们在提供反馈时感到尽可能舒适。  

You also want to make it easy to find -- I have a你还想让它更容易找到 -- 我有一个 [link to my feedback form我的反馈表链接](http://shorturl.at/vxF24) in my Twitter bio, and get a few comments a week through it.  

在我的 Twitter 简介中，每周都会收到一些评论。

I imagine resistance from some people on the grounds that anonymity frees people to be assholes, but in my experience they rarely are.  

我猜想有些人会以匿名会让人变得更混蛋为由进行抵制，但根据我的经验，他们很少会这样。  

90% of what I get in my inbox is either nonsense or nice -- I get lots of “keep up the good work!” type messages.  

我的收件箱里 90% 收到的不是废话就是好话--我收到很多 "继续努力！"之类的信息。  

In over a year, I’ve gotten maybe two messages intended to hurt my feelings.  

一年多来，我大概收到过两条伤害我感情的信息。  

Once in a while, I get a message that’s a gut punch because it calls my attention to a real issue -- but then I get over it and get to work fixing the issue.  

偶尔，我也会收到一则让我痛心疾首的信息，因为它让我注意到了一个真正的问题 -- 但随后我就会释然，并着手解决这个问题。  

(I wish people gave me(我希望人们给我 _more更多_ feedback -- I had to learn about my uptalk from YouTube comments.)  

反馈--我不得不从 YouTube 的评论中了解我的高谈阔论）。

The last couple times I was looking for a project, I made a point of meeting as many people doing related work as I could, even if there was no obvious benefit to doing so.  

在过去几次寻找项目的过程中，我尽可能多地结识从事相关工作的人，即使这样做并没有明显的好处。  

At first, I did this just to advertise my existence to people as I entered a new field, because someone is always hiring or looking for a cofounder.  

起初，我这样做只是为了在进入一个新领域时向人们宣传我的存在，因为总有人在招聘或寻找联合创始人。

What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance.  

通过广撒网，我发现自己几乎没有能力提前预测一个电话会有多大用处。  

Relevance is easier to predict, but it’s not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person’s enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests.  

相关性比较容易预测，但它并不能很好地代表有用性，而有用性是由很多其他因素决定的，包括对方的热情和兴趣的广度。  

To some extent, the more confident I am that a conversation is relevant, the less likely I am to discover something exciting during it.  

在某种程度上，我越是相信谈话是相关的，就越不可能在谈话中发现令人兴奋的东西。  

Nearly all of my most fruitful collaborations over the last 3 years have come out of meetings I booked almost at random.  

在过去的三年里，我几乎所有最有成果的合作都来自于我几乎是随意预约的会面。  

My best conversation last week was with someone where the introducer told me “this person asked for an introduction but I’m not sure it’s a good use of your time.”  

上周我最棒的一次谈话是在介绍人告诉我 "这个人要求我介绍他，但我不确定这是否适合利用你的时间 "的情况下进行的。

Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard.  

大多数学科都是可以学习的，即使是看起来非常难的东西。  

But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else.   

但除此之外，许多（大多数？）被人们视为固定不变的特质其实是很有可塑性的，只要你（1）相信它们是固定不变的，（2）像学习其他东西一样下功夫去学习它们。

As you might gather, I think agency itself is a good example. I learned agency late.  

如你所见，我认为代理本身就是一个很好的例子。我很晚才学会代理。  

In my teens and 20s, I occasionally made agent-y moves (like taking a job in a new city to be with someone I hadn’t spoken to yet; we married a few months later).  

在我十几岁和二十几岁的时候，我偶尔会做出一些中介式的举动（比如为了和一个我还没说过话的人在一个新城市工作；几个月后我们就结婚了）。  

But I still managed to pick a career I really disliked, for no reason other than its obviousness, and only after a decade stopped to ask what I was hoping to accomplish.  

但我还是选择了一个我非常不喜欢的职业，除了它的显而易见性之外，没有其他原因，我只是在十年后才停下来问一问我希望达到什么目的。

Many other supposedly fixed traits can likewise be altered.  

许多其他所谓的固定特质同样可以改变。  

Some other things you can learn: confidence, charisma, warmth, tranquility, optimism.  

你还可以学习其他一些东西：自信、魅力、温暖、宁静、乐观。  

Someone recently asked me how one might go about learning charisma, and the answer was really boring: by reading a few books, watching many hours of charismatic people interacting with others, and adopting a few of their habits.  

最近有人问我如何学习魅力，我的回答非常无聊：读几本书，看几个小时有魅力的人与他人的互动，然后养成他们的一些习惯。  

This is surely a plan of action most people could come up with if they didn’t have the notion that charisma is innate lodged in their heads.  

如果大多数人脑子里没有 "魅力与生俱来 "的观念，他们肯定会想出这样的行动计划。

Whatever it is, assume it can be learned and that the task is to figure out the best way to do it.  

不管是什么，假设它是可以学习的，任务就是找出最好的方法。

The moat of low status is one of my favorite concepts, [courtesy of my husband Sasha](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/the-moat-of-low-status-68a).  

地位低下的护城河是我最喜欢的概念之一，这是我丈夫萨沙提出的。  

The idea is that making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.  

这种想法认为，改变生活，尤其是学习新技能时，需要你跨过一条状态低迷的护城河，在这段时间里，你实际上做不好事情，或者不知道一些对其他人来说显而易见的事情。

It’s called a moat both because you can’t just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage. It’s possible to cross the moat quietly, by not asking questions and not collaborating, but those tradeoffs really nerf learning.  

之所以称之为 "护城河"，一是因为你不能一跃而过，二是因为能跨过护城河的人都能获得真正的优势。我们可以通过不提问、不合作的方式悄无声息地跨过护城河，但这些取舍确实会削弱学习效果。  

“Learn by doing” is standard advice, but you can’t do that unless you splash around in the moat for a bit.  

"从实践中学习 "是标准的建议，但如果不在护城河里泡一会儿，就无法做到这一点。

If you can learn to thrive in the moat, it’s incredibly liberating.  

如果你能学会在护城河中茁壮成长，那将是一种令人难以置信的解放。  

I once played a hand in a big poker tournament so badly there were有一次，我在一场大型扑克锦标赛中打得非常糟糕，有 [news stories新闻报道](https://www.worldpokertour.com/live_update/cate-hall-returns-to-wpt-five-diamond-discusses-ups-down-and-plans-should-she-reach-final-table-main-tour-wpt-five-diamond-world-poker-classic-season-2017-2018-1-25100-200/) about it. I’ll never关于它。我永远不会 _entirely完全_ get over my embarrassment about the hand, but I still look back on it with great fondness, because it’s when I realized I’d crossed some threshold of unflappability.  

虽然我已经摆脱了那只手给我带来的尴尬，但回想起来，我还是非常喜欢那只手，因为那时候我意识到自己已经跨过了不慌不忙的门槛。  

With cameras and reporters crowding around, I could have safely folded and no one would have paid attention; I chose to call knowing it would mean certain ridicule even if I won.  

在摄像机和记者的簇拥下，我本可以安全地弃权，没有人会注意我；但我选择了下注，因为我知道即使我赢了，也一定会被嘲笑。  

The call was in fact quite bad, but I made it for the  

这个电话其实很糟糕，但我还是打通了，因为 _right对_ wrong reason.  

错误的原因。

This might be the most important item on the list.  

这可能是清单上最重要的一项。  

It took me almost 40 years to learn it, because my instinct is to think more hours mean more productivity as long as you’re really我花了将近 40 年的时间才学会这一点，因为我的直觉是，只要你真的做到了，那么更多的工作时间就意味着更高的工作效率。 _trying难_ to be productive -- that’s just multiplication, right? No.  

这不就是乘法吗？不对  

The reality is that grinding, even if it temporarily increases output, kills creativity and big picture thinking.  

现实情况是，打磨即使能暂时提高产量，也会扼杀创造力和全局思维。

Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer.  

职业倦怠是机构的终极杀手。  

This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening.  

这一点是如此正确，以至于我学会了将代理能力的下降视为职业倦怠的最初征兆之一，甚至在我有意识地意识到发生了什么之前就已经显现出来了。  

A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won’t work or aren’t necessary, rather than chasing better versions.  

一个开关打开了，我开始寻找排除想法和行动的方法，断定它们不会奏效或没有必要，而不是追逐更好的版本。

These days I set boundaries that would have made me ashamed at earlier points in my life: I’m offline at 6 p.m.  

这些天来，我设定了一些在我生命的早期阶段会让我感到羞愧的界限：我几乎每天晚上 6 点就下线，并且严格遵守我的工作计划。  

almost every night, and rigorously observe a Sunday Sabbath where nothing with the flavor of effort is tolerated.  

我几乎每天晚上六点都会下线，并且严格遵守周日安息日的规定，在安息日里，我不能容忍任何带有努力味道的事情。  

These will seem like small things to some people, but like a mortal sin to others in the communities I run in.  

这些对某些人来说是小事，但对我所处社区的其他人来说却是弥天大罪。

My rule is never to take instructions on how hard I should work from someone who hasn’t burned out before.  

我的原则是，永远不接受那些以前未曾精疲力竭的人关于我应该如何努力工作的指示。  

Very few people take this seriously enough.  

很少有人会认真对待这一点。

Agency is the skill that built the world around you, an all-purpose life intensifier that lets you make your corner of it more like what you want it to be, whether that’s professional, relational, aesthetic, whatever.  

代理是构建你周围世界的技能，是一种万能的生活强化剂，它能让你的一角变得更像你想要的样子，无论是专业的、关系的、审美的，等等。  

Build a better mousetrap. Have an enviable marriage. Start a country.  

打造更好的捕鼠器。拥有令人羡慕的婚姻。建立一个国家。  

No one is born with it, everyone can learn it, and it’s never too late.  

没有人生来就会，但每个人都可以学会，而且永远不会太迟。

It happens all the time.  

这种情况经常发生。  

You read an amazing book, one so packed with wisdom that you think it’s going to change your life forever.  

你读了一本了不起的书，其中充满了智慧，你认为它将永远改变你的生活。  

Then…it doesn’t. Why?  

然后......就没有了。为什么？  

Because when you’re finally in a situation where you could use its insights, you’ve completely forgotten them.  

因为当你终于遇到可以用到它的见解时，你已经完全忘记了它们。  

Time is our most valuable resource, so we shouldn’t waste it.  

时间是我们最宝贵的资源，所以我们不应该浪费。  

The investment we make in reading should have a positive, lasting impact on our lives.  

我们在阅读上的投资应该对我们的生活产生积极而持久的影响。

**Consuming information is not the same as acquiring knowledge.  

消费信息不等于获取知识。  

No idea could be further from the truth.  

任何想法都与事实相去甚远。**

Learning means being able to use new information.  

学习意味着能够使用新信息。  

The basic process of learning consists of reflection and feedback.  

学习的基本过程包括反思和反馈。  

We learn facts and concepts through reflecting on experience—our own or others’.  

我们通过反思自己或他人的经验来学习事实和概念。  

If you read something and you don’t make time to think about what you’ve read, you won’t be able to use any of the wisdom you’ve been exposed to.  

如果你读了一些东西，却没有花时间去思考你所读到的东西，你就无法运用你所接触到的任何智慧。

One of the reasons that we read books is because they offer a rich tapestry of details, allowing us to see the world of the author and go on their journey with them.  

我们阅读书籍的原因之一是，书籍提供了丰富的细节，让我们能够看到作者的世界，并与作者一起踏上旅程。  

Our brains can learn not only the author’s ideas but also when their conclusions about how to live are likely to work and when they are likely to fail (thanks to the vast amount of details that authors share about their experiences and thought processes).  

我们的大脑不仅可以学习作者的想法，还可以学习他们关于如何生活的结论何时可能成功，何时可能失败（这要归功于作者分享的大量关于他们的经历和思考过程的细节）。

But if you only remember six things after reading this article, it should be the following truths about reading:  

但是，如果你读完这篇文章后只记住了六件事，那应该是以下关于阅读的真理：

1.  **Quality matters more than quantity.** If you read one book a month but fully appreciate and absorb it, you’ll be better off than someone who skims half the library without paying attention.  
    
    质量比数量更重要。如果你每个月只读一本书，但却能充分欣赏和吸收，那么你就会比那些在图书馆里囫囵吞枣的人过得更好。
2.  **Speed-reading is bullshit.** Getting the rough gist and absorbing the lessons are two different things.  
    
    速读是扯淡。了解大致内容和吸收课程内容是两码事。  
    
    Confuse them at your peril.  
    
    混淆视听，后果自负。
3.  **Book summary services miss the point.** A lot of companies charge ridiculous prices for access to vague summaries bearing only the faintest resemblance to anything in the book.  
    
    书籍摘要服务没有抓住重点。许多公司为了获得与书中内容相似度极低的模糊摘要而收取高得离谱的价格。  
    
    Summaries can be a useful jumping-off point to explore your curiosity, but you cannot learn from them the way you can from the original text.**\***  
    
    摘要可以成为你探索好奇心的一个有用的起点，但你不能像从原文中学习那样从摘要中学习\*。
4.  **Fancy apps and tools are not needed.** A notebook, index cards, and a pen will do just fine.  
    
    不需要花哨的应用程序和工具。一个笔记本、索引卡片和一支笔就足够了。
5.  **We shouldn’t read stuff we find boring.** Life is far too short.  
    
    我们不应该读我们觉得无聊的东西。人生苦短。
6.  **Finishing the book is optional.** You should start a lot of books and only finish a few of them.  
    
    读完书是可有可无的。你应该开始写很多书，只完成其中的几本。

_**\*** (By the way, the book summaries we write for Farnam Street [members](https://fs.blog/membership/) are definitely not in the same class as the standard fare.  

\*（顺便说一句，我们为法南街会员撰写的书摘与普通书摘绝对不是一个档次的。  

We make a significant time investment in each one, including reading the book several times and doing background research on the author, context, and content.  

我们对每本书都投入了大量时间，包括多次阅读，并对作者、背景和内容进行背景研究。  

And we still don’t pretend they’re as valuable as reading the book!)  

我们仍然不会假装它们和阅读这本书一样有价值！)_

In this article, we’ll explore multiple strategies for getting more out of what you read.  

在本文中，我们将探讨从阅读中获得更多收获的多种策略。  

You don’t need to use all these strategies for every book.  

您不必对每本书都使用所有这些策略。  

Using just a couple of them, whether you’re trying to learn a new philosophy or reading a work of fiction, can help you retain more and make deeper connections.  

无论是学习新哲学还是阅读小说作品，只需使用其中的几种方法，就能帮助你保留更多的内容，建立更深的联系。

What you read can give you access to untold knowledge. But _how_ you read changes the trajectory of your life.  

阅读可以让你获得无穷的知识。但如何阅读会改变你的人生轨迹。

## Active reading  

积极阅读

> _“Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself.

Now, if you’re only reading for fun, or if you don’t want to remember what you read, this article doesn’t apply.  

现在，如果你读书只是为了消遣，或者你不想记住读过的内容，那么这篇文章就不适用了。  

Sometimes reading is entertainment, and that’s wonderful.  

有时，阅读就是娱乐，这很好。  

But if you want to get some valuable knowledge out of a book, the first step to getting more out of what you read is being active.  

但如果你想从书中获得一些有价值的知识，那么要想从阅读中获得更多的收获，第一步就是要积极地阅读。  

So what is active reading?  

什么是主动阅读？

Active reading is thoughtfully engaging with a book at all steps in the reading process.  

主动阅读是指在阅读过程中的各个阶段都能深思熟虑地参与到一本书的阅读中。  

From deciding to read right through to reflection afterwards, you have a plan for how you are going to ingest and learn what’s in the book.  

从决定阅读到阅读后的反思，你都有计划如何摄取和学习书中的内容。

Books don’t enter our lives against a blank slate.  

书本进入我们的生活时并不是一片空白。  

Each time we pick up a book, the content has to compete with what we already think we know.  

每当我们拿起一本书时，书中的内容都必须与我们自认为已经知道的内容竞争。  

Making room for the book, and the potential wisdom it contains, requires you to question and reflect as you read.  

要为书和书中蕴含的潜在智慧留出空间，就需要你在阅读时质疑和反思。

For example, you might ask yourself:  

例如，你可以问自己

-   How does the book relate to topics you’re already familiar with?  
    
    这本书与您已经熟悉的主题有何关联？
-   What about the book challenges you?  
    
    这本书对你有什么挑战？
-   What are your preconceived notions about its subject, and how can you put them aside?  
    
    您对其主题有哪些先入为主的观念，如何才能抛开这些观念？

Active reading helps you make connections within your latticework of mental models.  

主动阅读可以帮助你在思维模式的格子中建立联系。  

Connections help retention.  

联系有助于记忆。

Think back to the books you studied in school, if you did.  

回想一下你在学校学习过的书籍吧。  

Despite the passage of time, many people remember a surprising amount about them.  

尽管时过境迁，许多人对这些书的记忆仍然出奇的深刻。  

Even if the details are fuzzy, we might at least be able to recall the basic plots, main characters, notable themes, and motifs. Why?  

即使细节模糊不清，我们至少还能回忆起基本情节、主要人物、显著主题和主题。为什么呢？  

Well for one, we probably didn’t just passively read those books.  

首先，我们可能不只是被动地阅读这些书。  

We were forced to actively read them, perhaps complete with class discussions where we took turns reading parts aloud, acted out scenes, or maybe even watched film adaptations.  

我们被迫积极地阅读这些书，也许还要进行课堂讨论，轮流朗读部分内容，表演场景，甚至观看改编电影。  

No matter how long it has been since we set foot in a classroom, many of us probably remember _Animal Farm_.  

无论我们有多久没有踏进教室，我们中的许多人可能都还记得《动物农场》。

Your first goal when reading is to not be a passive consumer of information.  

阅读的首要目标不是被动地接受信息。  

You want to get better, learn something, and develop your critical thinking skills.  

你想变得更好，学到一些东西，培养自己的批判性思维能力。  

If you had a good English teacher in school, you will have already seen this in action.  

如果你在学校里有一个好的英语老师，你就已经看到了这一点。

To get the most out of each book we read, it is vital we know how to record, reflect on, and put into action our conclusions.  

为了从每本书中获得最大的收获，我们必须知道如何记录、反思并将我们的结论付诸行动。

A lot of success in reading boils down to preparation.  

阅读的成功很大程度上归结于准备。  

What you do before you read matters more than you think.  

阅读前的准备工作比你想象的更重要。  

Here are five strategies to help you plan and get in the active reading frame of mind.  

以下五种策略可以帮助你制定计划并进入积极的阅读状态。

**Choose Great Books  

选择好书**

> _“Think before you speak. Read before you think.” —Fran Lebowitz  
> 
> "说话之前先思考。先阅读，再思考"。弗兰-莱博维茨_

There are no rules when it comes to choosing books.  

选书没有规则。  

We don’t have to read bestsellers, or classics, or books everyone else raves about.  

我们不一定要读畅销书、经典著作或其他人都赞不绝口的书。  

This isn’t school and there are no required reading lists.  

这里不是学校，没有必读书目。  

In fact, there’s an advantage to be gained from reading things other people are not reading, because you will gain knowledge and insights that not everyone else has.  

事实上，读别人不读的书会给你带来好处，因为你会获得别人没有的知识和见解。  

Focus on some combination of books that: 1) stand the test of time; 2) pique your interest; or 3) challenge you.  

重点阅读以下书籍1）经得起时间的考验；2）激发你的兴趣；或 3）向你提出挑战。

The more interesting and relevant we find a book, the more likely we are to remember its contents in the future.  

我们觉得一本书越有趣、越相关，将来就越有可能记住它的内容。  

For older books or those that have been translated, check which version is considered to be the best.  

对于旧书或已翻译的书籍，请查看哪个版本被认为是最好的。

**Get some context  

了解一些背景情况**

A good place to start getting context is by doing some preliminary research on the book.  

了解背景的一个好的开始是对这本书做一些初步研究。  

Some books—for example, [_A Confederacy of Dunces_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802130208/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0802130208&linkId=f12f7038c8f7e7658fd40e84734868bf) by John Kennedy Toole and [_Paradise_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804169888/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0804169888&linkId=86749140a8714ddfdb4192e29e24753c) by Toni Morrison—have a richer meaning once we know a bit about the life of the author and the place and time in which the novel was set.  

有些书--例如约翰-肯尼迪-图尔（John Kennedy Toole）的《纨绔子弟同盟》（A Confederacy of Dunces）和托尼-莫里斯（Toni Morrison）的《天堂》（Paradise）--在我们了解了作者的生平以及小说发生的地点和时间后，就会有更丰富的内涵。

For older books, try to understand the historical context.  

对于旧书，应试着了解其历史背景。  

For books written in an unfamiliar country, try to understand the cultural context.  

对于在陌生国家写的书，要试着了解其文化背景。  

Some helpful questions to ask include the following:  

可以提出以下一些有用的问题：

-   Why did the author write this?  
    
    作者为什么要写这篇文章？
-   What is their background?  
    
    他们的背景是什么？
-   What else have they written?  
    
    他们还写了什么？
-   Where was it written? Was there anything interesting about the writing process?  
    
    在哪里写的？写作过程中有什么有趣的事情吗？
-   What was the political, economic, and cultural situation at the time of writing?  
    
    写作时的政治、经济和文化状况如何？
-   Has the book been translated or reprinted?  
    
    该书是否已被翻译或再版？
-   Did any important events—a war, an economic depression, a change of leadership, the emergence of new technology—happen during the writing of the book?  
    
    在本书的写作过程中，是否发生过重要事件--战争、经济萧条、领导层更迭、新技术出现？
-   What was happening in the world during the time the novel is set?  
    
    在小说的背景时代，世界上发生了什么？  
    
    This is particularly useful to ask when it comes to fiction.  
    
    当涉及到小说时，这个问题尤其有用。

You don’t need to do this, but if you want to get a lot out of a book it will be a major boost.  

您不需要这样做，但如果您想从一本书中获得很多东西，这将是一个很大的帮助。

**Know your why  

了解为什么**

What are you reading this book for? Entertainment? To understand something or someone you don’t know?  

你读这本书是为了什么？娱乐？了解你不了解的事或人？  

To get better at your job? To improve your health? To learn a skill? To help build a business?  

为了更好地工作？为了改善健康？为了学习一技之长？为了帮助创业？

You have to have some idea of what you want to get from the book.  

你必须知道自己想从书中得到什么。  

If you don’t read with intention, what you read will never stick.  

如果你不是带着目的去阅读，你所读到的东西永远不会深入人心。  

If you are looking for business insights, read for that.  

如果你在寻找商业见解，那就为此而读。

Periodically ask yourself questions like: What can I learn from this story?  

定期问自己这样的问题：我能从这个故事中学到什么？我能从这个故事中学到什么？  

What in this book parallels or pertains to my own challenges? What are the differences?  

这本书中有哪些内容与我自己面临的挑战相似或相关？有哪些不同之处？  

How might I apply some of the insights I’m picking up?  

我可以如何应用我所获得的一些见解？

**Intelligently skim  

智能阅览**

Before starting to read a book (particularly nonfiction), skim through the index, contents page, preface, and inside the jacket to get an idea of the subject matter.  

在开始阅读一本书（尤其是非小说类）之前，先略读一下索引、目录页、前言和封套内页，以了解主题内容。  

(This article on [how to read a book](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/) is an introduction to more effective skimming.) Use this information to situate your expectations and refine what you are looking for as you read.  

(这篇文章介绍了如何更有效地略读一本书）。利用这些信息来确定您的期望值，并在阅读过程中细化您要寻找的内容。

The bibliography can also indicate the tone and scope of a book.  

参考书目还可以表明一本书的基调和范围。  

Authors often read hundreds of books for each one they write, so a well-researched book should have a bibliography full of interesting texts.  

作者往往每写一本书就会阅读上百本书，因此，一本研究透彻的书应该有一个充满趣味的书目。

After you’ve read the book, peruse the bibliography again and make a note of any books you want to read next.

  

读完一本书后，再次浏览书目，记下您想读的下一本书。

**Match the book to your environment  

将图书与您的环境相匹配**

Although it’s not always practical, matching books to our location and circumstances can be powerful.  

虽然这并不总是切实可行，但将书籍与我们的地点和环境相匹配，会产生强大的力量。  

Books will have a greater resonance as they become part of an experience rather than just supplementing it.  

当书籍成为经历的一部分而不仅仅是补充时，它们会产生更大的共鸣。

When choosing books, take a look at your own situation and decide on genres or authors that might help you overcome any current challenges or give you a fresh perspective.  

在选择书籍时，请审视一下自己的处境，选择那些可以帮助你克服当前挑战或给你带来新视角的类型或作者。  

Whatever your state of affairs, someone has been in the same place.  

无论你的境况如何，都有人和你有过相同的经历。  

Someone has felt the same feelings and thought the same thoughts and written about it.  

有人曾有过同样的感受、同样的想法，并将其写了下来。  

Someone can offer you new and useful ideas for navigating your situation.  

有人能为你提供新的、有用的想法，帮助你渡过难关。  

It’s up to you to find them.  

就看你怎么找了。

If we were doctors, we’d prescribe books. They can be powerful and healing.  

如果我们是医生，我们会给你开书。它们能给人带来力量和治愈。

## Remembering what you read  

记住阅读内容

> _“The things you’re looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine percent of them is in a book.” —_Ray Bradbury_, Fahrenheit 451_  
> 
> "你要找的东西，蒙塔格，就在这个世界上" "但普通人能看到其中99%的唯一途径 就是在书里"雷-布拉德伯里，《华氏 451 号

Now that you’re actively reading, you’re engaging on a deeper level with the book.  

现在，你正在积极阅读，在更深层次上参与到书中。  

You are making connections to your own life, seeing new opportunities and possibilities.  

你将自己的生活联系起来，看到了新的机遇和可能性。  

The next step is making sure you remember what’s important.  

下一步是确保你记住重要的事情。  

Even the most diligent of us get caught up in the busyness of life, and we thus lose those still-fragile connections we make while reading.  

即使是最勤奋的人，也会陷入繁忙的生活中，从而失去阅读时建立的那些仍然脆弱的联系。  

But we can help with that.  

但我们可以帮你解决这个问题。

You’ll remember more of what you read if you do the following five things while you’re reading.  

如果你在阅读时做了以下五件事，你就会记住更多的内容。

**Takes notes  

做笔记**

Making notes is an important foundation for reflecting and integrating what you read into your mind.  

做笔记是反思和将阅读内容融入头脑的重要基础。

[The best technique for notetaking](https://fs.blog/2013/11/taking-notes-while-reading/) is whichever one works for you and is easy to stick to.  

记笔记的最佳技巧就是适合自己且易于坚持的技巧。  

While there are hundreds of systems on the internet, you need to take one of them and adapt it until you have your own system.  

虽然互联网上有成百上千种记笔记的方法，但你需要从中选择一种并加以调整，直到拥有自己的记笔记方法。  

Some people prefer to record notes on index cards or in a commonplace book; others prefer a digital system.  

有些人喜欢把笔记记录在索引卡或便签本上；有些人则喜欢数字系统。  

Notes are especially useful if you write on a regular basis, although everyone (not just writers) can benefit from making them.  

如果你经常写作，笔记尤其有用，尽管每个人（不仅仅是写作者）都能从做笔记中受益。

In [_How to Take Smart Notes_](https://geni.us/BVm6xM), Sönke Ahrens suggests a way of approaching notetaking to make the books you read a lasting part of your thinking.  

在《如何巧妙地记笔记》一书中，桑克-阿伦斯（Sönke Ahrens）提出了一种记笔记的方法，让你阅读的书籍成为你思考的持久组成部分。  

If you’ve never really done any notetaking that was effective, his book is a great place to start.  

如果你从未真正有效地做过笔记，他的书是一个很好的开始。  

But wherever you begin, you must make a system your own depending on how you work and what you like to read. Although _How to Take Smart Notes_ focuses on nonfiction and assumes that fiction writers (and readers) have no need of notes, don’t let that stop you if you are researching a time period in which to set a novel or you’re trying to learn story structure and style from the great novelists.  

但无论从哪里开始，你都必须根据自己的工作方式和阅读喜好建立一套属于自己的系统。虽然《如何巧妙地记笔记》侧重于非虚构类作品，并假定虚构类作家（和读者）不需要记笔记，但如果你正在研究小说的时代背景，或者你正试图从伟大的小说家那里学习故事结构和风格，也不要因此而停下脚步。  

Adapt your notetaking system to suit your goals.  

根据自己的目标调整笔记系统。

Over the years, we tested a lot of different approaches to note-taking and even created our own that we use every day called **the Blank Sheet Method**. Here is how it works.  

多年来，我们测试了许多不同的记笔记方法，甚至创造了我们自己每天都在使用的 "空白页记笔记法"。具体操作如下。

1.  Before you start reading a new book, take out a blank sheet of paper.  
    
    在开始阅读新书之前，先拿出一张白纸。  
    
    Write down what you know about the book/subject you’re about to read — a mind map if you will.  
    
    写下你对即将阅读的书籍/主题的了解--可以说是思维导图。
2.  After you finish a reading session, spend a few minutes adding to the map with a different color.  
    
    阅读结束后，花几分钟时间在地图上添加不同的颜色。
3.  Before you start your next reading session, review the page.  
    
    在开始下一次阅读课之前，复习一下这一页。
4.  When you’re done reading, put these ‘blank sheets’ into a binder that you periodically review.  
    
    阅读结束后，将这些 "空白页 "装入活页夹，定期复习。

The blank sheet method is effective because it primes your brain and shows you what you’re learning.  

白纸练习法之所以有效，是因为它能激发你的大脑，让你知道自己在学什么。  

When you first start with a blank sheet, you’re forced to search your memory and put on paper what you know (or what you think you know) about a subject.  

当你从一张白纸开始阅读时，你不得不搜索你的记忆，并把你所知道的（或你认为你知道的）有关某个主题的知识写在纸上。  

As you read, you literally see your knowledge grow.  

在阅读过程中，你会真正看到自己的知识在增长。  

If you don’t know anything about a book or subject going in, don’t worry.  

如果你对某本书或某个主题一无所知，不用担心。  

You’ll be able to borrow the author’s scaffolding to get you started.  

你可以借用作者的脚手架来开始阅读。  

Reviewing your ‘blank sheet’ before your next reading session not only recalls the scaffolding and key ideas but improves your memory and connects ideas. When you’re done the book put the page into a binder.  

在下一次阅读之前，复习一下你的 "白纸"，不仅能回忆起脚手架和关键观点，还能提高记忆力并将观点联系起来。读完一本书后，将书页装入活页夹。  

Review the binder every few months.  

每隔几个月复习一次活页夹。  

This is essential for establishing deep fluency and connecting ideas across disciplines.  

这对建立深层次的流畅性和连接各学科的观点至关重要。

Another effective technique is to start your notetaking by writing a short summary of each chapter and transcribing any meaningful passages or phrases.  

另一个有效的方法是在开始记笔记时，写下每章的简短摘要，并抄录任何有意义的段落或短语。  

If you are unsure how to simplify your thoughts, imagine that someone has tapped you on the shoulder and asked you to explain the chapter you just finished reading.  

如果你不确定如何简化自己的思路，可以想象有人拍了拍你的肩膀，让你解释刚刚读完的章节。  

They have never read this book and lack any idea of the subject matter.  

他们从来没有读过这本书，对主题缺乏了解。  

How would you explain it to them?  

你会如何向他们解释？

As you are reading a book, write your chapter summary right at the end of the chapter.  

当你阅读一本书时，在章节末尾写下你的章节总结。  

If your reading session is over, this helps synthesize what you just read.  

如果你的阅读课已经结束，这有助于总结你刚刚读过的内容。  

When you pick up the book tomorrow, start by reading the previous two chapter summaries to help prime your mind to where you are in the book.  

当你明天拿起这本书时，先阅读前两章的摘要，以帮助你更好地理解书中的内容。

**Stay focused  

保持专注**

Decide that for the time you will be reading, you will focus on the book and nothing else.  

决定在阅读的这段时间里，你将把注意力集中在书本上，而不是其他地方。  

No quick Twitter checks. No emails. No cell phone. No TV. No staring into midair.  

不快速查看 Twitter。没有电子邮件。没有手机。不看电视。不盯着半空。  

Understanding and absorbing a book requires deep focus, especially if the subject matter is dense or complex.  

理解和吸收一本书需要高度集中注意力，尤其是在主题内容密集或复杂的情况下。  

Remember, we are aiming for active reading.  

记住，我们的目标是主动阅读。  

Active reading requires focus and the ability to engage with the words on the page.  

主动阅读需要集中精力，能够与书页上的文字打成一片。

Referring to the time before the internet, Nicholas Carr writes in _The Shallows_: “_In the quiet spaces opened up by the prolonged, undistracted reading of a book, people made their own associations, drew their own inferences and analogies, fostered their own ideas.  

尼古拉斯-卡尔（Nicholas Carr）在《浅滩》（The Shallows）一书中提到了互联网出现之前的时代："在长时间、心无旁骛地阅读书籍所开辟的宁静空间里，人们会产生自己的联想，进行自己的推理和类比，培养自己的思想。  

They thought deeply as they read deeply.  

他们一边深读，一边深思。_”

When you’re looking for results, for some tangible change to come out of reading a book, you need to engage with it as you’re reading it.  

当你想从阅读一本书中获得成果，获得一些实实在在的改变时，你需要在阅读过程中参与其中。  

And that requires focus.  

这就需要专注。

If you’re struggling to stay focused on a particularly difficult or lengthy book, decide to read a mere [25 pages of it a day](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/12/twenty-five-pages-a-day/). It takes only a few minutes to nibble away at a challenging text.  

如果你很难集中精力读完一本特别难懂或冗长的书，那就决定每天只读 25 页。只需几分钟就能啃完一篇有难度的文章。  

Completing a long book in this manner might take months, but at least you will have read it without getting overwhelmed or bored.  

以这种方式读完一本长书可能需要几个月的时间，但至少你读完后不会感到不知所措或厌倦。

**Mark up the book  

标记书本**

Most of us were taught as children to treat books as something sacred—no folding the page corners, and no writing in the margins, ever.  

我们中的大多数人从小就被教育要把书本当作神圣的东西来对待--永远不要折页角，永远不要在空白处写字。  

However, if you want to remember what you read and you have the means to do so, forget about keeping books pristine.  

然而，如果你想记住你读过的书，而且你有办法做到这一点，那就忘掉保持书本原貌吧。

Go crazy with [marginalia](https://fs.blog/2015/01/marginalia/). The more you write, the more active your mind will be while reading.  

疯狂地写页边空白。你写得越多，阅读时思维就越活跃。  

If you can’t mark up the book, do it on paper and note the page numbers.  

如果你不能在书上做标记，那就在纸上做，并记下页码。

Jot down connections and tangential thoughts, underline key passages, and make a habit of building a dialogue with the author(s).  

记下联系和切题的想法，在关键段落下划线，养成与作者对话的习惯。  

Some people recommend making your own index of key pages or using abbreviations.  

有些人建议自己制作关键页索引或使用缩写。

The first time you write in a book can be unnerving, but in the long term, it leads to a rich understanding and a sense of connection with the author.  

第一次在一本书上写东西可能会让你感到不安，但从长远来看，这会让你对作者产生丰富的理解和联系感。

**Make mental links  

建立心理联系**

Books do not exist in a vacuum. Every concept or fact can be linked to countless others.  

书籍并非存在于真空中。每个概念或事实都可以与无数其他概念或事实联系起来。  

Making an effort to form our own links is a fruitful way to better remember what we read.  

努力形成我们自己的联系，是更好地记住所读内容的有效方法。

Building vivid mental pictures is one of the most effective techniques for remembering anything, not least what we read.  

建立生动的思维画面是记忆任何东西最有效的技巧之一，尤其是我们阅读的内容。  

When you come across an important passage or concept, pause and visualize it.  

当你遇到一个重要的段落或概念时，停下来想象一下。  

Make the picture as salient and distinctive as possible by connecting it to other ideas already in your brain.  

通过将其与大脑中已有的其他想法联系起来，使画面尽可能突出和鲜明。

Another way of building links is to hang everything on a latticework of mental models.  

另一种建立联系的方法是把所有东西都挂在心智模型的格子上。  

Having a framework of deliberately constructed concepts enables us to better understand and synthesize books by allowing us to make connections to what we already know.  

拥有一个特意构建的概念框架，可以让我们与已有的知识建立联系，从而更好地理解和综合书本知识。  

Knowledge sticks in our memories easier if it attaches to something we already understand.  

如果知识与我们已经理解的事物相联系，那么它就更容易在我们的记忆中留下痕迹。

Using models while reading can also help you get more out of the book.  

在阅读时使用模型也能帮助你从书中获得更多。  

Here are some examples of paths they might lead you down:  

下面举例说明它们可能会引领你走过的道路：

-   [Confirmation bias](https://fs.blog/mental-models/): Which parts of this book am I ignoring? Does this book confirm my opinions?  
    
    确认偏见：我忽略了这本书的哪些部分？这本书是否证实了我的观点？  
    
    (Okay, but does it actually affirm your beliefs or are you just seeing what you want to see?  
    
    (好吧，但它是真的肯定了你的信念，还是你只是看到了你想看到的东西？  
    
    If you cannot think of a single point in the book that you disagreed with, confirmation bias is likely distorting your reasoning.)  
    
    如果你想不出书中有哪一点是你不同意的，那么很可能是确认偏见扭曲了你的推理）。
-   [Bayesian updating](https://fs.blog/2018/09/bayess-theorem/): What opinions should I change in light of this book?  
    
    贝叶斯更新：根据这本书，我应该改变哪些观点？  
    
    How can I update my worldview using the information in it?  
    
    如何利用其中的信息更新我的世界观？  
    
    Keep in mind the words of John Maynard Keynes: “When the facts change, I change my mind.  
    
    请记住约翰-梅纳德-凯恩斯的话："当事实发生变化时，我就会改变我的想法。  
    
    What do you do, sir?”  
    
    你是做什么的，先生？"
-   [Incentives](https://fs.blog/2017/10/bias-incentives-reinforcement/): What motivates the characters or the author? What are they seeking? What is their purpose?  
    
    动机：人物或作者的动机是什么？他们在寻求什么？他们的目的是什么？  
    
    Here’s how Kurt Vonnegut described the importance of incentives in books: “When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell the students to make their characters want something right away—even if it’s only a glass of water.  
    
    库尔特-冯内古特（Kurt Vonnegut）是这样描述书中激励机制的重要性的："我以前教创意写作时，会告诉学生让他们笔下的人物立刻想要什么--哪怕只是一杯水。  
    
    Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time.”  
    
    被现代生活的无意义所麻痹的人物时不时还得喝口水"。
-   [Availability bias](https://fs.blog/2021/06/availability-bias-cognitive-distortion/): Are the books I have recently read affecting how I perceive this one?  
    
    可用性偏差：我最近读过的书是否会影响我对这本书的看法？  
    
    How are my immediate past experiences shaping my reading?  
    
    我过去的经历是如何影响我的阅读的？  
    
    Am I assigning undue importance to parts of this book because they are salient and memorable?  
    
    我是否因为这本书的部分内容突出且令人难忘，就过分重视它们？
-   [Social proof](https://fs.blog/2009/09/mental-model-social-proof/): How is social proof—the number of copies sold, bestseller status, the opinions of others—affecting my perception of this book?  
    
    社会证明：社会证明--销售数量、畅销书地位、他人意见--如何影响我对这本书的看法？  
    
    Is the author using social proof to manipulate readers?  
    
    作者是否在利用社会证明来操纵读者？  
    
    It is not unusual for authors to buy their way onto bestseller lists, providing social proof that then leads to substantial sales.  
    
    作者通过购买的方式登上畅销书榜单，提供社会证明，进而带来可观的销售额，这种情况并不罕见。  
    
    As a result, mediocre books can end up becoming popular.  
    
    因此，平庸的书籍最终也会变得流行起来。  
    
    It’s a classic case of the emperor having no clothes, which smart readers know to look out for.  
    
    这是一个典型的 "皇帝没穿衣服 "的案例，聪明的读者知道要注意这一点。
-   [Survivorship bias](https://fs.blog/2019/12/survivorship-bias/): Is this (nonfiction) book a representation of reality or is the author failing to account for base rates?  
    
    幸存者偏差：这本（非虚构）书是在反映现实，还是作者没有考虑基数？  
    
    Survivorship bias is abundant in business, self-help, and biographical books.  
    
    在商业、自助和传记类书籍中，幸存者偏见比比皆是。  
    
    A particular case of a successful individual or business might be held as the rule, rather than the exception.  
    
    一个成功的个人或企业的特殊案例可能会被视为常规，而不是例外。
-   [Utility](https://fs.blog/2019/09/externalities-why-we-can-never-do-one-thing/): If a book offers advice, does it have practical applications?  
    
    实用性：如果一本书提供了建议，它是否有实际应用价值？  
    
    At what point do diminishing returns set in?  
    
    什么时候会出现收益递减？

**Stop when bored  

无聊时停下来**

When it comes to reading, you don’t need to finish what you start.  

说到阅读，你不需要读完你开始读的东西。  

As a general rule, people who love reading never, ever finish a crappy book.  

一般来说，热爱阅读的人永远不会读完一本烂书。

As Arthur Schopenhauer once wrote, “_One can never read too little of bad, or too much of good books: bad books are intellectual poison; they destroy the mind_.” Life is much too short to finish a bad book. You need to be ruthless and heartless.  

亚瑟-叔本华曾写道："坏书读得再少也不为过，好书读得再多也不为过：坏书是思想的毒药，它们会摧毁人的思想。人生苦短，不能读完一本烂书。你需要无情无义。  

Don’t let sunk costs guilt you into wasting your time.  

不要让沉没成本让你感到内疚，浪费你的时间。

Author and librarian Nancy Pearl advocates the “[Rule of 50](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/nancy-pearls-rule-of-50-for-dropping-a-bad-book/article565170/).” This entails reading the first 50 pages of a book and then deciding if it is worth finishing.  

作家兼图书管理员南希-珀尔提倡 "50法则"。这需要读完一本书的前 50 页，然后决定是否值得读完。  

The Rule of 50 has an interesting feature: once you are over the age of 50, subtract your age from 100 and read that many pages.  

50 岁法则》有一个有趣的特点：一旦你超过 50 岁，就用 100 减去你的年龄，然后阅读相应的页数。  

Pearl writes:  

珍珠写道：

> _“And if, at the bottom of Page 50, all you are really interested in is who marries whom, or who the murderer is, then turn to the last page and find out.  
> 
> "如果在第 50 页下面，你真正感兴趣的是谁娶了谁，或者谁是凶手，那么翻到最后一页就知道了。  
> 
> If it’s not on the last page, turn to the penultimate page, or the antepenultimate page, or however far back you have to go to discover what you want to know.…When you are 51 years of age or older, subtract your age from 100, and the resulting number (which, of course, gets smaller every year) is the number of pages you should read before you can guiltlessly give up on a book.…When you turn 100, you are authorized (by the Rule of 50) to judge a book by its cover.”  
> 
> 如果不在最后一页，就翻到倒数第二页，或倒数第二页之前的一页，或者无论你要翻到多远才能发现你想知道的....，当你 51 岁或以上时，用 100 减去你的年龄，得出的数字（当然，每年都会变小）就是你在可以毫无愧疚地放弃一本书之前应该阅读的页数....，当你 100 岁时，你被授权（根据 "50法则"）通过封面来判断一本书的好坏"。_

\*\*\*

## Now what?  

现在怎么办？

So you’ve finished the book. Now what? How can you use what you have learned?  

你已经完成了这本书。现在怎么办？如何运用你学到的知识？  

Don’t just go away with a vague sense of “Oh yeah, I should totally do what that author says.” Take the time to make a plan and decide how to implement key lessons from the book.  

不要只是模糊地觉得 "哦，是的，我应该完全按照作者说的去做"。花点时间制定一个计划，决定如何实施书中的关键经验。

**Apply what you’ve learned  

学以致用**

Reading alone is not enough. We have to contextualize the knowledge. When does it work?  

仅仅阅读是不够的。我们必须将知识与背景相结合。什么时候有用？  

When doesn’t it work? Where can I apply it? What are the key variables? The list goes on.  

什么时候不起作用？在哪里可以应用？关键变量是什么？诸如此类的问题不胜枚举。  

If you can take something you’ve read and apply it immediately, it will reinforce the learning and add context and meaning.  

如果你能把读到的东西立即应用起来，就能巩固所学知识，增加背景和意义。

Another way to reinforce the learning is to apply the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/), named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.  

另一种强化学习的方法是应用以诺贝尔物理学奖得主理查德-费曼命名的费曼技巧。  

You can think of it as an algorithm for guaranteed learning.  

你可以把它看作是一种保证学习的算法。  

There are four simple steps: choose a concept, teach it to someone unfamiliar with the subject, identify gaps in your understanding and go back to the source material, and review and simplify.  

有四个简单的步骤：选择一个概念，教给不熟悉这个主题的人，找出自己理解上的差距并回到原始材料，复习并简化。

Teaching others is a powerful way to embed information in your mind.  

向他人传授是将信息牢记于心的有效方法。  

Upon completing a book, grab the nearest (willing) person and tell them about what you have learned.  

读完一本书后，抓住最近的人（愿意的人），告诉他们你学到了什么。  

You’ll have to remove or explain the jargon, describe why this information has meaning, and walk them through the author’s logic.  

你必须删除或解释术语，描述这些信息的意义，并引导他们理解作者的逻辑。  

It sounds simple. After you try it the first time, you’ll realize it’s not easy.  

这听起来很简单。当你第一次尝试之后，你会发现这并不容易。

If there is no one around who is interested, try writing a review where people are encouraged to comment and debate.  

如果周围没有感兴趣的人，可以尝试写一篇评论，鼓励大家发表评论和辩论。

In order to think for yourself, you need to reflect on your views and see how they stand up to feedback.  

为了独立思考，您需要对自己的观点进行反思，看看它们在反馈意见面前的表现如何。

**Make your notes searchable  

让您的笔记可以搜索**

There are endless ways of organizing your notes—by book, by author, by topic, by the time of reading.  

整理笔记的方法多种多样，可以按书、按作者、按主题、按阅读时间来整理。  

It doesn’t matter which system you use as long as you will be able to find the notes in the future.  

只要将来能找到笔记，使用哪种系统并不重要。

Having a catalogue of everything you learn from reading creates a priceless resource that can be consulted whenever you need an idea, want inspiration, or want to confirm a thought.  

将你从阅读中学到的所有知识编成目录，可以为你创造一个无价的资源，无论何时你需要一个想法，想要灵感，或者想要确认一个想法，都可以随时查阅。  

Over the years, you will build up a bank of wisdom to refer to in times of crisis, uncertainty, or need.  

经过多年的积累，你将建立起一个智慧库，在遇到危机、不确定或需要时可以参考。  

It is hard to convey quite how valuable this can prove to be.  

这一点有多么宝贵，难以言表。

As General Jim Mattis wrote: “_Thanks to my reading, I have never been caught flat-footed by any situation, never at a loss for how any problem has been addressed (successfully or unsuccessfully) before.  

正如吉姆-马蒂斯将军写道："多亏了我的阅读，我从未被任何情况吓得措手不及，从未对任何问题的解决方法（成功或失败）感到茫然。  

It doesn’t give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead.  

它没有给我所有的答案，但它照亮了我前方往往是黑暗的道路。_”

The options for cataloguing your notes include the following:  

笔记编目选项包括以下内容：

-   A box of index cards, ideally organized by subject, topic, author, or time of reading.  
    
    一盒索引卡，最好按主题、话题、作者或阅读时间分类。  
    
    Index cards can be moved around.  
    
    索引卡可以随意移动。
-   A commonplace book (again, ideally organized by topic, author, or time of reading).  
    
    一本通俗读物（同样，最好按主题、作者或阅读时间编排）。
-   A digital system, such as Evernote, OneNote, or plain old Microsoft Word.  
    
    数字系统，如 Evernote、OneNote 或普通的 Microsoft Word。  
    
    Digital systems have the added benefit of being searchable, which can save a lot of time if you refer to your notes on a regular basis.  
    
    数字系统还有一个好处，就是可以搜索，如果你经常查阅笔记，这可以节省很多时间。

Schedule time to read and review these notes.  

安排时间阅读和复习这些笔记。

**Reread (if you want to)  

重读（如果你想）**

“_Read a lot. Expect something big, something exalting or deepening from a book.  

"多读书。期待从书中得到一些重要的、令人赞叹或深化的东西。  

No book is worth reading that isn’t worth rereading.  

没有一本不值得重读的书是值得一读的。_” —Susan Sontag  

" -苏珊-桑塔格

Skim a lot of books. Read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.  

浏览大量书籍。读几本。最好的立即重读两遍。  

While rereading can seem like a waste of time because there are so many other books to read, this is a misunderstanding of the learning process.  

重读看似浪费时间，因为还有很多其他书要读，但这是对学习过程的误解。  

The best time to start rereading a great book is right after finishing.  

重读一本好书的最佳时机是刚刚读完。  

The goal is not to read as many books as possible.  

我们的目标不是读尽可能多的书。  

The goal is to gain as much wisdom as you can.  

我们的目标是获得尽可能多的智慧。

Rereading good books is of tremendous importance if we want to form lasting memories of the contents.  

如果我们想对书中的内容形成持久的记忆，重读好书是非常重要的。  

Repetition is crucial for building memories.  

重复对于建立记忆至关重要。

Happy reading!  

祝您阅读愉快

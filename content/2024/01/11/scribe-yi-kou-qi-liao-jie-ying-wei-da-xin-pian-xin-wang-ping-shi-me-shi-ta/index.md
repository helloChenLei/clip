Many investors are calling this an unprecedented. Once-in a lifetime release.  

许多投资者称这是一次史无前例。一生只有一次的发布。  

NVIDIA relied on the dazzling data, giving Wall Street a slap in the face.  

英伟达依靠令人眼花缭乱的数据，给了华尔街一记响亮的耳光。

The stock soared by 30% on the day-market cap reached trillion of dollars propelled NVIDIA into becoming sixth largest company in the world, surpassing Tesla and approaching Amazon, who would have thought that a company-selling graphics cards would become the biggest winner in the AI war. In 2023. For the past few years, NVIDIA participated in almost all of global tech innovation, cloud computing, cryptocurrency, metaverse artificial intelligence.  

当天股价飙升 30%，市值达到万亿美元，推动英伟达成为全球第六大公司，超越特斯拉，逼近亚马逊，谁能想到一家卖显卡的公司会成为人工智能大战的最大赢家。2023 年过去几年，英伟达几乎参与了全球所有的科技创新，云计算、加密货币、元宇宙人工智能。

NVIDIA is main player in all these majority of the AI model you ’ ve heard of, are trained with NVIDIA graphics cards.

Even the quantity of owning NVIDia A100 graphics cards, an indicator to measure a company ’ s computational power.  

甚至，拥有英伟达 A100 显卡的数量，也是衡量一家公司计算能力的指标。  

The founder Jensen Huang said, sounds arrogant, right?  

创始人黄仁勋说，听起来很傲慢吧？

But that ’ s the truth with his foresight, from over 20 years, and his unchanging outfit style, becomes the godfather of AI.  

但事实就是如此，他凭借自己 20 多年来的远见卓识，以及一成不变的装备风格，成为了人工智能教父。  

You must be wondering what ’ s so great about NVIDia, how did they monopolise?  

您一定想知道 NVIDIA 有什么了不起，他们是如何垄断一切的？  

Why nobody can compete against them.  

为什么无人能与之抗衡？  

Today, let Lin take you down a trip to the story of NVIDIA.  

今天，就让林志颖带你一起走进英伟达的故事。  

We ’ ll also talk about the secret behind graphic card and chip industry.  

我们还将谈谈显卡和芯片产业背后的秘密。

Let ’ s begin with the rise of Jensen Huang and NVIDia in 1963. Jensen Huang was born in Tainan, taiwan, which means he is 60 years old.  

让我们从 1963 年黄仁勋和英伟达的崛起说起。黄仁勋出生于台湾台南，今年 60 岁。  

After graduating from college, he worked in two semiconductor companies focusing on chip design.

Jensen Huang is the CEO.  

Jensen Huang 是首席执行官。  

He still is today with recommendation from his former boss.  

在前老板的推荐下，他至今仍是首席执行官。

He obtained $20 million capital investment from Sequoia capital After all, gaming industry needs real time rendering.  

他获得了红杉资本 2000 万美元的投资 毕竟，游戏行业需要实时渲染。  

When playing, you can ’ t say there ’ s no 3d games, but definitely can ’ t play with normal computer.  

玩游戏时，不能说没有 3D 游戏，但绝对不能用普通电脑玩。  

Graphic is basically, well, as long as you can see a figure there, because this kind of 3d image processing is computationally intensive, it was difficult for the CPU at that time.  

图形基本上是，嗯，只要能看到一个图形就可以了，因为这种 3D 图像处理是计算密集型的，对当时的 CPU 来说很困难。

Normally, they need a specific chip to process the graphics. And this chip is graphic card.  

通常，他们需要一个特定的芯片来处理图形。这种芯片就是图形卡。  

In the early days, the graphics card was very simple. It was a 3d accelerator card at most.  

早期的显卡非常简单。它最多只是一块 3d 加速卡。  

Now, when you hear 3d accelerator, it sounds like a small workshop business, that's right, actually, at that time, 3d games and 3d rendering was at seeding stage.  

现在，当你听到 3d 加速器时，听起来像是一个小作坊的业务，没错，实际上，在那个时候，3d 游戏和 3d 渲染还处于播种阶段。

Graphics card companies like NvidIA are actually a lot, at least 50,60 companies, there was no uniform standard for both hardware and software.  

像 NvidIA 这样的显卡公司其实有很多，至少有 50、60 家，硬件和软件都没有统一的标准。  

Whoever comes out with better research, can publish their own standard often times when you finally came up with a graphics card, but it actually is not compatible with other people ’ s standard.  

谁的研究成果更好，谁就能发布自己的标准，很多时候，当你终于拿出了一块显卡，但它实际上并不兼容其他人的标准。  

Just one-word chaotic. One of the most famous company at the time is a company called 3DFX.  

就是一个乱字。当时最有名的一家公司叫 3DFX。

It was established in 1994, a year later than NVIDIA.  

它成立于 1994 年，比英伟达晚一年。  

At that time, a graphics card called Voodoo was all the rage.  

当时，一款名为 Voodoo 的显卡风靡一时。  

Many popular games during that time relied on Voodoo graphic card.

They finally occupy a place in the market and allow Nvidia to survive.  

他们终于在市场上占据了一席之地，让 Nvidia 得以生存。  

Actually, jensen and his team are very strong in their R & D.  

其实，jensen 和他的团队在研发方面是很有实力的。

After they figure out the market direction, they managed to enter fast lane quickly, they reached a long-term strategic cooperation with TSMC.  

在摸清市场方向后，他们迅速进入快车道，与台积电达成长期战略合作。  

At the same time, they cooperate closely with Microsoft supported the direct 3d display standard introduced by Microsoft.  

同时，他们与微软紧密合作，支持微软推出的直接 3D 显示标准。

Finally, they rose in the sea of competition in graphics card industry.

I believe that gamers should be familiar with this Geforce series.  

相信玩家们对这个 Geforce 系列应该不会陌生。  

It has also become NVIDIA ’ s the flagship line of consumer graphics card, jensen Huang named Geforce256, the world ’ s first GPU, the first truly dedicated graphics card.  

它也成为 NVIDIA 消费级显卡的旗舰产品线，黄仁勋将 Geforce256 命名为世界上第一块 GPU、第一块真正意义上的专用显卡。  

The claim is basically accepted by everyone.  

这一说法基本上得到了所有人的认可。  

Hence, some people might generally claimed that NVIDIA invented the graphics card.  

因此，有些人可能会笼统地认为是 NVIDIA 发明了显卡。

As for why this dedicated graphics card is so powerful. We will talk about it later.  

至于这款专用显卡为何如此强大？我们稍后再谈。  

At that time, microsoft happened to be working on Xbox with Geforce 256 powerful performance.  

当时，微软正好在开发 Xbox，其 Geforce 256 性能非常强大。  

NVIDIA managed to score $200 million worth of order after building image processing hardware for Xbox.  

在为 Xbox 制造图像处理硬件之后，英伟达成功获得了价值 2 亿美元的订单。  

They then score another with Sony ’ s Ps3 from 1999 to 2002. $2 billion, becoming the only player in the market.  

1999 年至 2002 年，他们又在索尼的 Ps3 上获得了价值 20 亿美元的订单。20 亿美元，成为市场上唯一的玩家。  

They started to acquire competitors in the same industry.  

他们开始收购同行业的竞争对手。

One of them, we mentioned earlier, the once popular 3DFX, another major player in the market.  

其中之一就是我们前面提到的曾经风靡一时的 3DFX，它是市场上的另一个主要玩家。  

ATI, was acquired by AMD.  

ATI 被 AMD 收购。  

And so, in the early 2000s, after a series of merger and acquisition happening in the market, there are only two players left in the market, NvidIA and AMD.  

于是，21 世纪初，在市场上发生了一系列并购之后，市场上只剩下了 NvidIA 和 AMD 两家公司。  

Until now, the dedicated graphics card market has been dominated by these two companies.  

到目前为止，专用显卡市场一直由这两家公司主导。

I don ’ t know if you have heard of the legendary N-card and a card actually refer to the graphics cards of these two companies.  

不知道大家有没有听说过传说中的 N 卡和一卡通，其实指的就是这两家公司的显卡。  

Gamers started to argue whether N-card or a card is better. It doesn ’ t matter which one is better.  

玩家们开始争论 N 卡好还是 A 卡好。其实孰优孰劣并不重要。  

Third company exists in the market, like B-card of C-card or X-card.  

市场上还存在第三家公司，如 B 卡、C 卡或 X 卡。

It ’ s a two-horse race, however, Nvidia is gradually eating away AMD ’ s market share from 60% in 2010, slowly expanded to 80% in 2022 becoming global GPU.  

然而，Nvidia 正在逐渐蚕食 AMD 的市场份额，从 2010 年的 60%，慢慢扩大到 2022 年的 80%，成为全球 GPU 领域的霸主。  

Hegemon. The speed of development of GPU technology itself is also jaw-dropping.

So much improvement in image quality, even if you don ’ t understand game, you can see the speed of progress.  

画质提高了这么多，即使你不懂游戏，也能看到进步的速度。  

In fact, the overall graphics card market is in a tripartite state.  

事实上，整个显卡市场处于三足鼎立的状态。  

Three biggest player – Intel Nvidia AMd Intel, occupied 71% of market share, Nvidia is 17%, and AMD is 12%. Way higher.  

三大巨头--英特尔 Nvidia AMd 英特尔，占据了 71% 的市场份额，Nvidia 是 17%，而 AMD 是 12%。高出太多了。  

Didn ’ t you just say that NvidIA is the biggest player. Actually.  

你刚才不是说 Nvidia 是最大的玩家吗？事实上

This graphics card is not the same graphics card, because graphics card is divided into dedicated and integrated graphics card.  

此显卡非彼显卡，因为显卡分为专用显卡和集成显卡。  

If you were to compare both, then Intel, indeed is the biggest player, but they sell Mostly integrated graphics card.  

如果将两者进行比较，英特尔确实是最大的玩家，但他们销售的大多是集成显卡。  

Integrated graphics card is placed together with CPU.  

集成显卡与 CPU 放在一起。  

They share memory, so Intel taking advantage of their position in CPU industry.

Monopolise the integrated graphics card market share.  

垄断了集成显卡的市场份额。  

However, the integrated graphics card is quite weak.  

然而，集成显卡的性能相当弱。

I won ’ t explain in details here.comparing with Nvidia ’ s dedicated graphics card, although they are both graphics card, but they don ’ t belong in same market.  

与 Nvidia 的专用显卡相比，虽然它们都是显卡，但不属于同一个市场。  

Just from dedicated graphics market. POV, NvidIA occupied 80% of the market, share.  

仅从专用显卡市场来看来看，Nvidia 占据了 80% 的市场份额。  

Some of, you might start to get bored now. They are very good at it.  

有些人现在可能开始感到厌倦了。他们很擅长这个  

I ’ ve been talking a lot about 3d rendering and gaming. How does it have anything to do with AI?  

我一直在谈论 3D 渲染和游戏。这和人工智能有什么关系？

Why are all these AI companies want to buy graphics card? And it has to be Nvidia ’ s graphics card.  

为什么这些人工智能公司都想买显卡？而且必须是 Nvidia 显卡。  

Don ’ t worry, we ’ ll talk about graphics card characteristic in a computer central processing unit.  

别急，我们来谈谈计算机中央处理器中的显卡特性。

The purpose of its design is that it can do everything.

  

它的设计目的是让它无所不能。  

It ’ s sequential computing, and it can carry out very complex logical reasoning.  

它是顺序运算，可以进行非常复杂的逻辑推理。  

However, image processing doesn ’ t care much about sequential computing.  

但是，图像处理对顺序运算并不关心。

It ’ s more concerned with computational volume. For example, a 4k video has 10 million pixels.  

它更关注计算量。例如，一个 4k 视频有 1 千万像素。  

Let ’ s say there ’ s 30 frames per second, then each pixel and frame has to compute correspond colour based on shadow and action.  

假设每秒有 30 帧，那么每个像素和帧都要根据阴影和动作计算对应的颜色。  

This requires non-stop. Very fast and massive, simple calculations is graphics processing unit.  

这需要不停地进行。图形处理器的计算速度非常快，计算量非常大，计算简单。  

Parallel computing.  

并行计算。

So for CPU is 64 or 128 core at best, while GPU could have thousands of core computing together at the same time.  

因此，CPU 最多只有 64 或 128 个内核，而 GPU 可以有数千个内核同时运算。  

See, this video is giving a very good explanation.  

看，这段视频给出了很好的解释。  

CPU is like a very precise, very strong gun firing one shot at a time.  

CPU 就像一把非常精确、非常强大的枪，一次发射一发子弹。  

The shots are fired in clear order, but slow GPU, on the other hand, is like having thousands of this gun firing at the same time, due to GPU.  

由于 GPU 的存在，子弹发射的顺序非常清晰，而 GPU 的速度慢，就像成千上万支枪同时开火。

Special feature, jensen Huang started to think about how to maximise its potential.  

特殊功能，黄仁勋开始思考如何最大限度地发挥它的潜力。  

It ’ s definitely as simple as 3d image processing and rendering.  

这肯定和 3D 图像处理和渲染一样简单。  

Can they carry out more of general purpose computing, general purpose computing, general-purpose graphics processing, but it ’ s not simple to use GPU to do this kind of general purpose computing, because the purpose of its design is not for this.  

它们可以进行更多的通用计算、通用计算、通用图形处理，但用 GPU 来做这种通用计算并不简单，因为它的设计目的不是为此。  

Very difficult, not anyone can do this job.  

难度很大，不是谁都能胜任的。

Jensen Huang was thinking that if graphics card was to realise its greater potential, it needs to be programmable.  

黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）认为，如果显卡要发挥更大的潜力，就必须实现可编程。  

By chance.  

一个偶然的机会。  

He saw a project by a Phd student in Stanford, using C language programming to let GPU do some computing.  

他在斯坦福大学看到了一个博士生的项目，使用 C 语言编程让 GPU 进行计算。  

Jensen thought this idea is amazing, and offered this fella a job at Nvidia.  

詹森觉得这个想法非常棒，于是给了这个家伙一份在 Nvidia 的工作。  

He appointed him with a very important job, and let him lead the team to carry out R & D in making GPU programmable.  

他委以重任，让他带领团队进行 GPU 可编程的研发工作。

Finally, in 2006, NvidIA officially released CUDA, making GPU programmable in order to build this CUDA system.  

终于，在 2006 年，NVIDIA 正式发布了 CUDA，使 GPU 可编程，从而建立了这个 CUDA 系统。  

NVIDIA invested a large and unreasonable amount of capitals and human resources into it.  

英伟达为此投入了大量不合理的资金和人力资源。  

Originally, those graphics card, that to support CUDA.  

最初，那些支持 CUDA 的显卡。  

Graphics card that specializes in 3d graphics processing Need many top engineers to make it programmable, but now anyone can do it by buying an NVIDIA graphics card and use it with CUDA library.  

但现在，任何人都可以通过购买英伟达显卡并使用 CUDA 库来实现这一点。

Through CUDA, NVIDIA expanded the boundary of graphics card, from gaming and 3d image processing to a whole realm of accelerated computing, like aerospace, biopharmaceuticals, weather forecast,ing, energy exploration, and so on, are actually using large amount of NVIDIA graphics card to carry out computation.  

通过 CUDA，英伟达拓展了显卡的边界，从游戏和 3D 图像处理扩展到整个加速计算领域，像航空航天、生物制药、天气预报、能源勘探等领域，实际上都在大量使用英伟达显卡进行计算。  

Many have tried to create software like CUDA, to challenge NVIDIA ’ s position, but NVIDIA has a monopoly on hardware itself.  

许多人试图开发 CUDA 等软件来挑战英伟达的地位，但英伟达本身在硬件上就处于垄断地位。

They can try everything to merge their hardware graphics card with the software CUDA, and make them work really well with each other.  

他们可以想尽一切办法将自己的硬件显卡与软件 CUDA 相结合，使它们能够很好地相互配合。  

Through hardware and software merger, they formed a very strong moat.  

通过软硬件合并，他们形成了一条非常坚固的护城河。  

Make you think of another company that ’ s Apple, they all build something that ’ s had been bandied about in business world, an ecosystem.  

让你联想到另一家公司，那就是苹果公司，他们都建立了一种在商业世界中被广泛提及的东西--生态系统。  

Microsoft, adobe, they all have their own strong ecosystem.  

微软、Adobe 都有自己强大的生态系统。

The amount of capital Jensen invested in CUDA, might sound reasonable to you. Now, it makes sense.  

詹森在 CUDA 上投入的资金对你来说可能听起来很合理。现在看来，是有道理的。  

But if you look at short term return, it is very unreasonable.  

但如果从短期回报来看，这就非常不合理了。  

Wall Street is quite displeased with this thing, because although the computation performance of GPU is outstanding, but their application is not much for a long period of time, it can only focus on area that requires massive computing.  

华尔街对这件事颇为不满，因为 GPU 的计算性能虽然出众，但长期应用却不多，只能专注于需要大规模计算的领域。  

To put it bluntly, it's not profitable at all.  

说白了，就是根本不赚钱。

Who would ’ ve thought that AI could be so popular in 2023, right?  

谁能想到，人工智能在 2023 年会如此流行吧？  

In fact, it is not AI that first makes the accelerated computing capabilities of graphics cards, realise its commercial value.  

事实上，首先让显卡的加速计算能力实现商业价值的，并不是人工智能。  

That ’ s not related to AI at all. Something that even someone like Jensen could not have expected.  

这与人工智能完全无关。这一点，连詹森这样的人都始料未及。  

The explosion of Bitcoin brought a huge demand for mining mining.  

比特币的爆发带来了巨大的挖矿需求。

In essence, is mindless computing to encrypt and decrypt in order to do mining in faster way, then you will need to use graphics card, and you have to use NvidIA ’ s graphics card.  

从本质上讲，就是无脑计算加密和解密，要想更快地进行挖矿，那么就需要使用显卡，而且必须使用 Nvidia 的显卡。

我相信大多数人都是从挖矿部分才知道使用显卡进行计算的。  

The huge demand for mining is like a godsend for Nvidia A big gift.  

巨大的挖矿需求对于 Nvidia 来说简直就是天赐的大礼。  

This makes Nvidia ’ s graphics card in constant short supply.  

这使得 Nvidia 的显卡一直处于供不应求的状态。

For years, NVIDIA was very nice. They designed a GPU, specifically for mining.  

多年来，英伟达（NVIDIA）一直很好。他们设计了一款 GPU，专门用于挖矿。  

Of course, many would say mining pollutes the environment, meaningless computation, all sorts of problems. Many, and NvidIA did make lots of money because of it.  

当然，很多人会说挖矿会污染环境，计算毫无意义，有各种各样的问题。很多人，英伟达确实因此赚了很多钱。

According to analysts, between 2018 to 2021, a period when Bitcoin was very popular, NvidIA could earn up to $1 to $3 billion annually.

  

据分析师称，在 2018 年到 2021 年之间，也就是比特币非常流行的时期，NvidIA 每年的收入可达 10 到 30 亿美元。

Nvidia ’ s market cap even surpassed the giant Intel during the time when Bitcoin was very popular.  

在比特币非常流行的时期，Nvidia 的市值甚至超过了巨头英特尔。  

Their market cap even approached trillion dollars, although mining has made NvidIA a lot of money, but it is, after all, not its main business.  

其市值甚至接近万亿美元，虽然挖矿让 NvidIA 赚了不少钱，但这毕竟不是它的主营业务。  

After the crash of crypto market, Nvidia ’ s stock plunged by 46%. So far.  

加密货币市场崩溃后，Nvidia 的股价暴跌了 46%。到目前为止  

Mining is only a sideshow, at best.  

采矿充其量只能算个配角。

We all know what ’ s really been helping Nvidia lately, artificial intelligence, we mentioned that Graphics CARD, massive parallel computing capability is very suitable for deep learning, and machine learning AI has to keep learning up to billions of times.  

我们都知道最近真正对 Nvidia 有帮助的是人工智能，我们提到过 Graphics CARD，大规模并行计算能力非常适合深度学习，而机器学习 AI 要不断学习高达数十亿次。  

In Jensen Huang showed that to train a large language model, in comparison with CPU, GPU server can complete it at 4% of the cost, and 1.2% of power.  

在 Jensen Huang 的展示中，要训练一个大型语言模型，与 CPU 相比，GPU 服务器只需 4% 的成本、1.2% 的功耗即可完成。  

Therefore, GPU CPU are not on the same level.  

因此，GPU 和 CPU 并不在同一水平线上。

This is determined by its underlying structure.  

这是由其底层结构决定的。  

Jensen Huang just wanted to subtly tell you that to train large language model, only a fool would use CPU.  

黄仁勋只是想巧妙地告诉大家，要训练大型语言模型，只有傻瓜才会使用 CPU。  

You have to use GPU. If you use GPU, you ’ d better use CUDA.  

你必须使用 GPU。如果使用 GPU，最好使用 CUDA。  

Then you have to buy the graphics card from Nvidia, actually, a decade ago, no one knows Graphics card can be used in AI.  

那你就得买 Nvidia 的显卡，实际上，十年前没人知道显卡能用在人工智能上。

AI itself is more theoretical than practical.

  

人工智能本身更多的是理论而非实践。

The change occurred in 2012. At that time, there ’ s a very famous computer competition, called Imagenet.  

变化发生在 2012 年。当时，有一个非常有名的计算机竞赛，叫做 Imagenet。

We ’ ve talked about this in ChatGPT episode.  

我们在ChatGPT 一集中讨论过这个问题。  

The theory of neural network has been around for a long time, but it had not been realised.  

神经网络的理论由来已久，但一直未能实现。  

The problem was with computational power. Thanks to Nvidia ’ s graphics card.  

问题出在计算能力上。多亏了 Nvidia 的显卡。

It ’ s very clear.  

这一点非常清楚。  

Now, when you look at their earnings report, currently, they divided their business into 4 segments.  

现在，当你看他们的财报，目前，他们把业务分为四个部分。

Gaming data Centre, automotive, professional, graphics processing previously, NVIDIA ’ s ACE business was gaming and data center is about accelerated computing.  

游戏数据中心、汽车、专业、图形处理 以前，英伟达的 ACE 业务是游戏，数据中心是加速计算。  

This segment. These two segments are the main ones. In 2018. Gaming occupied half of their business.  

这个部分。主要就是这两个板块。在 2018 年。游戏占据了他们业务的一半。  

Data center is a quarter by 2022 Data center occupies 56% of their business. Gaming dropped to 33%.  

到 2022 年，数据中心占四分之一 数据中心占其业务的 56%。游戏下降到33%。  

The earning report released on 24th May, their revenue dropped significantly due to sluggish global demand in gaming.  

5 月 24 日发布的财报显示，由于全球游戏需求低迷，他们的营收大幅下降。

This is actually what Wall Street expected.  

这其实也在华尔街的预料之中。  

However, data center segment is strong 18% growth from previous quarter.  

不过，数据中心业务比上一季度强劲增长了 18%。  

Most importantly, the revenue in second quarter, blinded Wall Street Wall Street predicted that their revenue for Q2 would be $7.2 billion.  

最重要的是，第二季度的营收让华尔街傻了眼。华尔街预测第二季度的营收将达到 72 亿美元。  

But Nvidia came out and said your estimation is incorrect.  

但 Nvidia 出来说，你们的估计不正确。  

Our revenue is $11 billion, 50% more for automotive segment.

It is a segment with great potential.  

这是一个潜力巨大的细分市场。

Not only have to do chip for cars, also need to create car system.  

不仅要做汽车芯片，还要打造汽车系统。  

At initial stage, it ’ s difficult to say what ’ s going to happen in future, so we ’ ll not discuss it before This NVIDIA released Omniverse to bet on Metaverse, although we haven ’ t seen much return yet, but I ’ ve watched the promotional video.  

在初始阶段，很难说未来会发生什么，所以我们在此之前先不讨论这个问题。 NVIDIA 发布 Omniverse，押注 Metaverse，虽然还没看到什么回报，但我看了宣传视频。  

It really is quite cool.  

它真的很酷。

If Metaverse ushered in explosive period, then NVIDIA will again be ON of the biggest winner.  

如果说 Metaverse 迎来了爆发期，那么英伟达将再次成为最大赢家。  

It ’ s definite.  

这是肯定的。  

Anyway, the general picture is that gaming needs Graphics card mining, needs graphics card, AI computing needs graphics card, need graphics card.  

总之，总的情况是，游戏需要显卡，挖矿需要显卡，人工智能计算需要显卡，需要显卡。  

Look for NVIDIA.  

寻找英伟达。  

NVIDIA stock price rose by over 1000 fold from its initial IPO, becoming the sixth largest company in the world.  

英伟达的股价比首次公开募股时上涨了 1000 多倍，成为全球第六大公司。  

And it looks like it's just getting started from the stories earlier.  

从之前的报道来看，它才刚刚起步。

You would ’ ve believe Jensen is almost godlike. The way for the continuity of the story.  

你会相信詹森几乎就是神一样的存在。故事的连续性。  

I ignored it.  

我忽略了它。  

In the early 2000s, there was a series of graphics card failures almost defeated by ATI.  

2000 年代初，ATI 公司出现了一系列显卡故障，几乎被击败。  

There were also insider trading committed by employees. Sec, did a thorough investigation on them.  

还有员工进行内幕交易。Sec 对他们进行了彻底调查。  

There was also problem with over-marketing.  

还有过度营销的问题。  

They even tried to enter mobile phone chip market, but it was all a failure looking at their stock price.  

他们甚至试图进军手机芯片市场，但从股价上看，一切都失败了。

Although, it has risen so much as a whole.  

虽然股价整体上涨了很多。  

But in 2002, it dropped by 90%, 2008, dropped 80% with more than 50% of retracement.  

但 2002 年下跌了 90%，2008 年下跌了 80%，回调幅度超过 50%。  

This occurs every 3 to 5 years. Everyone knows. Jensen is great, but he is no fortune teller.  

这种情况每 3 到 5 年就会发生一次。大家都知道。詹森很厉害，但他不是算命先生。  

His obsession with leather jacket. I don ’ t know what else to say.  

他对皮夹克的痴迷。我不知道还能说什么了  

Alright, let ’ s talk a little bit about NVIDIA ’ s stock price.  

好了，我们来谈谈英伟达的股价吧

I ’ m worried that many would rush to buy NvidIA ’ s stock.  

我担心很多人会抢购英伟达的股票。  

Buy it on a whim, the estimated value for Nvidia is too high.  

我担心很多人会急于买入英伟达的股票，心血来潮地买入，因为英伟达的估计价值太高了。  

From every perspectives, their price-to-earning ratio is over 200 price to sales ratio is 38 For Apple, microsoft, and Google, their price to earning is less than 40 Tesla is only over 70 Compare them with those in same industry, their revenue is less than half of Intel ’ s, but market cap is 7 times more than Intel Revenue is similar to AMD, but market cap is 5 times more than AMD.  

从各个角度来看，他们的市盈率都超过了 200，市销率为 38，而苹果、微软和谷歌的市盈率不到 40，特斯拉只有 70 多。  

One word expensive.  

一个字贵。

Of course, they are expensive, for a reason for a company in an industry like this.  

当然，对于这样一个行业的公司来说，价格昂贵是有原因的。  

Moreover, it ’ s a monopolistic company, its valuation is no longer one of the main criteria for judging stock price.  

而且，它是一家垄断性公司，其估值不再是判断股价的主要标准之一。  

Reason. Do you know what it is?  

原因。你知道是什么原因吗？  

There are some professional institutions Dare not to not invest in Nvidia, because AI is the biggest wave with biggest opportunity in the market.  

有一些专业机构不敢不投资 Nvidia，因为人工智能是市场上机会最大的浪潮。  

And Nvidia is the biggest player in this AI wave.  

而 Nvidia 就是这股人工智能浪潮中最大的玩家。

When these funds invested in Nvidia, even if the stock price fall, investors wouldn ’ t complain much.  

当这些基金投资 Nvidia 时，即使股价下跌，投资者也不会有太多抱怨。  

But if Nvidia stock price keeps rising and they didn ’ t invest, because the price is expensive, then investors would really be pissed.  

但是，如果 Nvidia 的股价持续上涨，而他们却因为价格昂贵而不投资，那么投资者就真的要生气了。  

Cathie wood liquidated Nvidia stocks in January, through her ETF.  

凯茜-伍德在一月份通过她的 ETF 基金清算了 Nvidia 的股票。  

Lately, Nvidia stock price is rising.  

最近，Nvidia 的股价正在上涨。  

She was reviled in the investment circle, choosing to not invest in this type of company, would risk fund their reputation.  

她在投资圈内备受谩骂，选择不投资这类公司，会让自己的声誉面临资金风险。

There ’ s a term in English that best describe this behaviour. It is, FOMO, fear of missing out.  

英语中有一个术语最能描述这种行为。它就是 FOMO，害怕错过。  

More than buying at expensive price. This is similar to Tesla two years ago, ev has great future.  

比起以昂贵的价格购买。这与两年前的特斯拉类似，ev 具有广阔的前景。  

And Tesla was the only option, even if its valuation is astronomical.compare to other automotive companies, but funds still continued to buy.  

特斯拉是唯一的选择，即使其估值与其他汽车公司相比简直是天文数字，但资金仍在继续购买。

The behaviour of FOMO, in turn, pushes the stock price of these companies to an even higher position.

  

FOMO 的行为反过来又将这些公司的股价推向了更高的位置。

You can say that for these type of companies, they just have huge risk premium.  

可以说，这类公司的风险溢价非常高。  

But just because of this, you can ’ t say that their stock price is too high.  

但不能因此就说它们的股价过高。  

That's not necessarily true, because it, they can sustain this momentum, and maintain this development trend, then their stock price will continue to rise.  

这并不一定正确，因为如果它们能保持这种势头，维持这种发展态势，那么它们的股价就会继续上涨。  

There's a metaphor that many people often use. The wave, we mentioned, is similar to gold rush.  

很多人经常用一个比喻。我们提到的浪潮，类似于淘金热。

To bet where the gold is, or who will find the gold. But there is a sure fire deal.  

打赌黄金在哪里，或者谁能找到黄金。但有一个稳赚不赔的买卖。  

And that is, you can sell shovels. Nvidia is like selling a shovel at digital age at AI age.  

那就是，你可以卖铲子。Nvidia 就像是在人工智能时代的数字时代出售一把铁锹。  

This metaphor sounds right, and quite reasonable.  

这个比喻听起来很对，也很合理。  

But whenever I hear this analogy, it doesn ’ t seems right.  

但每当我听到这个比喻时，就觉得不对。  

Those who understand economy would know that if you sell shovel during gold rush, could you be making a fortune?  

了解经济的人都知道，如果你在淘金热时期卖铁锹，你能赚大钱吗？

The first one would perhaps earn a little, but if more people are selling it, and it ’ s easy to make shovel, then the marginal profit would quickly be eaten up.  

第一种可能会赚一点，但如果卖的人多了，而制作铁锹又很容易，那么边际利润很快就会被蚕食殆尽。  

So in most industries, if you sell this so-called shovel, the upstream production tool, due to its low entry barrier, the competition in the industry will be very fierce.  

所以在大多数行业中，如果卖的是这种所谓的铁锹，即上游生产工具，由于其进入门槛低，行业竞争会非常激烈。  

So, the profit margin will be low.  

所以，利润率会很低。

Can achieve a monopoly and a market value of trillions by doing this, so-called shovel.  

能做到垄断，市值上万亿，靠的就是这个，所谓的铲子。  

Its, similar to TSMC, more basic than shovel, they make hammer, a tool to make shovel, and they can monopolise that, have you ever thought?  

它类似于台积电，比铲子更基础，他们做锤子，做铲子的工具，他们可以垄断，你想过吗？  

Why we ’ ll get deep into the feature of chip industry?  

为什么我们要深入探讨芯片行业的特点？

Have you heard of Moore ’ s law on an integrated circuit, the number of transistors that can be accommodated double up every 18 months, you can understand it as the speed of chip can be faster every 18 months, actually, for the past few years, the speed of CPU evolution is difficult to catch up with Moore ’ s law.  

你听说过集成电路上的摩尔定律吗？每隔 18 个月，可容纳的晶体管数量就会翻一番，你可以理解为芯片的速度每隔 18 个月就能加快一倍，实际上，在过去几年里，CPU 的进化速度很难赶上摩尔定律。  

However, jensen found that the advancement of GPU dedicated graphics card is faster than prediction.  

不过，Jensen 发现，GPU 专用显卡的发展速度比预测的要快。

Of Moore ’ s law, performance increase more than triples every 2 years.  

摩尔定律，性能每 2 年提高三倍以上。  

Law, no matter which law it is. This is a distinctive feature in Chip industry.  

不管是哪一种定律，都是如此。这是芯片行业的一个显著特点。  

The initial cost to invest is very high and requires a lot of talents and equipment.  

初始投资成本很高，需要大量人才和设备。  

The problem is that the iteration rate is too fast. This is an industry that is constantly running.  

问题是迭代速度太快。这是一个不断运转的产业。  

The iteration rate of this industry is too fast.  

这个行业的迭代速度太快。  

From business perspective, this pose a tricky problem.  

从商业角度来看，这构成了一个棘手的问题。

It ’ s difficult for company to build their own moat.  

公司很难建立自己的护城河。  

Moat is very important to a company for a traditional company.  

护城河对传统企业来说非常重要。  

If they spent a lot of money to build a factory, a railroad, then they have large-scale advantage and cost advantage.  

如果他们花费大量资金建造一座工厂、一条铁路，那么他们就拥有了规模优势和成本优势。  

These advantages work as a moat.  

这些优势就像一道护城河。  

This moat will protect the company for a long time, the moat of internet company is stronger once a network effect is established.  

一旦形成网络效应，互联网公司的护城河就会更加牢固。

Facebook users are your strong moat for chip industry. There are Moore ’ s law, huang ’ s law.  

对于芯片行业来说，Facebook 用户就是你强大的护城河。有摩尔定律、黄氏定律。  

No matter how good of a chip you release today, it ’ ll be outdated in two years.  

不管你今天发布了多好的芯片，两年后都会过时。  

You won ’ t know who ’ ll make it next year, and take you down with his new technology in the 90s.  

你不知道明年会是谁做出来，用他 90 年代的新技术打败你。

During the graphics card war, a company established less than two years, 3DFX quickly became the industry standard with their Voodoo graphics card.  

在显卡大战期间，成立不到两年的 3DFX 公司凭借其 Voodoo 显卡迅速成为行业标准。  

5 years later, they became dreary and was acquired by NvidIA.  

5 年后，他们变得黯淡无光，被 NvidIA 收购。  

This is because their moat hasn ’ t finished building and was destroyed in this industry.  

这是因为他们的 "护城河 "还没有建好，就被这个行业摧毁了。  

It ’ s difficult to rely on a single product or a single technology to form a moat that lasts more than 2 years.  

依靠单一产品或单一技术很难形成持续两年以上的护城河。

Of course, you can slowly accumulate many patents to defend yourself.  

当然，你可以慢慢积累很多专利来保护自己。  

Patents, it doesn ’ t provide much protection. You have to keep running and run faster than everyone.  

但专利并不能提供多少保护。你必须不停地跑，跑得比谁都快。

This running ability is your moat. In chip industry, the moat is R & D.

  

这种奔跑能力就是你的护城河。在芯片行业，护城河就是研发。  

You have to develop a complete set of talents, facilities, organisation, structure, these form the moat for chip Company.  

你必须培养一整套人才、设施、组织和结构，这些构成了芯片公司的护城河。

This is why R & D is expensive.

  

这就是研发费用昂贵的原因。

First is the initial cost is very high, requires a lot of talents.  

首先是初始成本很高，需要大量人才。  

Most importantly, you have to continuously keep the iteration and running speed high.  

最重要的是，你必须不断保持迭代和高速运转。  

Not a lot of people can stand it.  

没有多少人能受得了。  

Those tech giants are actually very focused on technological innovation, amazon, google, microsoft, their R & D investment is 10% to 15% of their revenue For Nvidia, they have to keep invest around 25% of their revenue for R & D.  

那些科技巨头其实都非常注重技术创新，亚马逊、谷歌、微软，它们的研发投入占收入的 10%至 15%；而 Nvidia 的研发投入占收入的 25%左右。

The Huang ’ s law is not a natural phenomenon.  

黄氏定律并非自然现象。  

A story, we can say, Nvidia has been monopolising graphics card market since 2006, end in just one sentence.  

一个故事，我们可以说，Nvidia 从 2006 年开始垄断显卡市场，一句话就能说完。  

However, for many times, they overturned their own framework and technology, they pushed themselves to release new generation of chip every 6 months.  

但是，他们却多次颠覆自己的框架和技术，每半年就推出新一代芯片。

For example, their latest ray tracing RTX technology completely overturned the program accumulated before they use deep learning method through 1 pixel, they guess, what, the other 8 pixels surround, it looks like to speed up image processing.  

比如，他们最新的光线追踪 RTX 技术完全颠覆了之前积累的程序，他们通过深度学习的方法，通过 1 个像素，他们猜到了什么，其他 8 个像素环绕，看起来就像是加快了图像处理的速度。  

This intense running speed makes only those who run fastest with largest pool of talent and wealthiest companies can make money.  

这种激烈的奔跑速度使得只有那些跑得最快、人才储备最多、最有钱的公司才能赚到钱。  

The rest could only run behind. This is why we often see that.  

其他人只能跟在后面跑。这就是我们经常看到的现象。

After a war in chip industry, it always ends in acquisition.  

芯片行业的战争总是以收购告终。  

It's not just the difficulty of developing chips. It ’ s mainly because it ’ s not economical.  

这不仅仅是因为芯片研发的难度。主要是因为不经济。  

With plentiful talents, won't set foot in the chip industry, unless they are forced to, but things are different.  

人才济济，除非迫不得已，否则不会涉足芯片行业，但现在不同了。  

Now, the AI field is one of the biggest possible battleground for the tech giants.  

现在，人工智能领域是科技巨头们最大的可能战场之一。  

In this battle graphics card is too important. After all, it determines computing speed.  

在这场战役中，显卡太重要了。毕竟，它决定了计算速度。

Non-of them wish to be strangled by Nvidia during AI era, right?  

谁也不想在人工智能时代被 Nvidia 扼杀吧？  

Although currently they are Nvidia ’ s biggest customer, but at the same time, they delve into R & D and chip making in full swing.  

虽然它们目前是 Nvidia 的最大客户，但同时也在如火如荼地进行研发和芯片制造。  

Google already developed a chip specifically designed for AI training called TPU.  

谷歌已经开发出一款专门用于人工智能训练的芯片，名为 TPU。  

According to them, it is more efficient than Nvidia's graphics card.  

据他们说，它比 Nvidia 的显卡更高效。

In 2017, meta already used over 20,000 Nvidia's graphics cards for AI training, but now they are also all in researching chip calling it MTIA actually from 2020. Seeking Masayoshi, son ’ s softbank to acquire their chip company arm at the price of $40 billion.  

2017 年，元已经将 2 万多块 Nvidia 的显卡用于 AI 训练，但现在他们也在全力研究芯片，称其为 MTIA，实际上是从 2020 年开始。正吉之子软银以 400 亿美元的价格收购了他们的芯片公司部门。  

But Qualcomm, microsoft and Google are all strongly against it. The deal fell through from here.  

但高通、微软和谷歌都强烈反对。交易就此告吹。

You can see that those tech giants are actually very afraid of Nvidia emerging from the early days.  

可以看出，这些科技巨头其实非常惧怕早期崛起的 Nvidia。  

Graphics card industry is his ability. Having laid out CUDA, since 20 years ago, is his vision.  

显卡产业就是他的能力。从 20 年前开始布局 CUDA，是他的远见卓识。  

Continuous monopoly in graphics card industry is his endurance, meeting the demand for massive computing power in mining is his luck.  

持续垄断显卡行业是他的耐力，满足矿业对海量计算能力的需求是他的运气。  

The unchanged fashion style is his devotion.  

一成不变的时尚风格是他的执着。

When long accumulation period meets the AI wave, Nvidia naturally obtain, first mover advantage facing new vast potential market and competitors looking to get in on the action.  

当漫长的积累期遇上人工智能浪潮，面对新的广阔潜在市场和想要插一脚的竞争对手，Nvidia 自然而然地获得了先发优势。  

Their way out again. In this new wave of AI fight, it ’ s hard to say.  

他们的出路又在哪里？在这场新一轮的人工智能厮杀中，很难说。

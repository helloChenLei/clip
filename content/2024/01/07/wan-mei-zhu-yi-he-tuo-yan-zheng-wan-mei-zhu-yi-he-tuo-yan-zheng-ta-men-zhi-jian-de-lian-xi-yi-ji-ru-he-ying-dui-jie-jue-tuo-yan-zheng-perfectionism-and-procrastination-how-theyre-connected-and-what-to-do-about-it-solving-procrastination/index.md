[_Procrastination_](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination/) is a [common issue](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-statistics/), which occurs when people unnecessarily postpone decisions or actions, generally despite knowing that doing so is likely to [cause them issues](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-dangers/).  

拖延是一个常见的问题，当人们不必要地推迟决定或行动时就会出现拖延，尽管他们通常知道这样做可能会给他们带来问题。

One reason why people procrastinate is _perfectionism_.  

人们拖延的一个原因是完美主义。  

For example, perfectionistic students might be so critical of themselves for making mistakes in school assignments, that they will postpone doing homework to avoid dealing with the associated negative emotions.  

例如，完美主义的学生可能会因为在学校作业中犯错而对自己大加批评，从而推迟做作业，以避免处理相关的负面情绪。  

Similarly, perfectionistic writers might be so worried about their book being criticized, that they will delay sending the book for feedback.  

同样，完美主义作家可能会因为担心自己的书受到批评，而推迟寄书征求反馈意见。

The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination can have serious implications, so it’s important to understand it.  

完美主义和拖延症之间的关系可能会产生严重影响，因此了解这一点非常重要。

## The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination  

完美主义与拖延症之间的关系

The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is [complex](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.736776), and [depends](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-012-0149-5) on the [specific aspects](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) of perfectionism that a person has:  

完美主义和拖延症之间的关系很复杂，取决于一个人完美主义的具体方面：

-   **Some aspects of perfectionism generally _increase_** **procrastination.** These include, most notably, _perfectionistic concerns_, which are [characterized primarily](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) by critical and negative self-evaluations, excessive preoccupation with other people’s expectations, lack of satisfaction from successful performance, excessive [worry](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384) over [making mistakes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.10.104), and [doubts](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.896454) about one’s abilities and actions, often in [irrational](https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013) ways or to irrational degrees. Such concerns [represent](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) the more _maladaptive_ side of [perfectionism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2014.10.009), since they generally lead people to experience negative outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing.  
    
    完美主义的某些方面通常会加重拖延症。其中最明显的是完美主义的担忧，主要表现为批判性和消极的自我评价，过分专注于他人的期望，对成功的表现缺乏满足感，过分担心犯错，以及对自己的能力和行为产生怀疑，怀疑的方式和程度往往是非理性的。这些担忧代表了完美主义中适应不良的一面，因为它们通常会导致人们在工作表现和幸福感等方面出现负面结果。  
    
    For example, these concerns can lead a student to unnecessarily delay submitting their assignments, because they’re excessively worried that they’ve made mistakes.  
    
    例如，这些担忧可能会导致学生不必要地延迟提交作业，因为他们过分担心自己犯了错误。
-   **Some aspects of perfectionism generally _decrease_ procrastination.** These include, most notably, _perfectionistic strivings_, which are [characterized primarily](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) by setting and striving for excessively high personal standards, often with a focus on attaining flawlessness in one’s work. Such strivings [represent](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) the more _adaptive_ side of [perfectionism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2014.10.009), since they generally lead people to experience positive outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing.  
    
    完美主义的某些方面通常会减少拖延。其中最明显的是完美主义的追求，其主要特点是设定并追求过高的个人标准，通常侧重于在工作中做到完美无瑕。这种追求代表了完美主义更具适应性的一面，因为它们通常会使人们在工作表现和幸福感等因素方面获得积极的结果。  
    
    For example, these strivings can lead a student to submit all their assignments on time, because they want to get a perfect grade.  
    
    例如，这些追求会导致学生按时提交所有作业，因为他们想得到满分。

Furthermore, [other characteristics](https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013) of people’s perfectionism can also [play a role](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1213374) in determining how their perfectionism influences their procrastination. For example, _socially-prescribed perfectionism_, which [involves](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397045-9.00166-X) people having high standards [set](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-0227-6_6) for them by [others](https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2008.36.6.753), is [more likely](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65) to increase procrastination, whereas _self-oriented perfectionism_, which [involves](https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013) people [setting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2017.04.010) high standards for [themselves](https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.1992.20.2.85), is more likely to decrease procrastination.  

此外，人们完美主义的其他特征也会对完美主义如何影响拖延症起到决定作用。例如，社会规定的完美主义（即他人对自己提出高标准）更有可能增加拖延症，而自我导向的完美主义（即他人对自己提出高标准）则更有可能减少拖延症。

In addition, various issues can influence people’s perfectionism, and the [relationship](https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2008.36.6.753) between it and their procrastination. For example, when people receive [parental criticism](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1213374), this can exacerbate their perfectionistic concerns, which in turn can exacerbate their procrastination.  

此外，各种问题也会影响人们的完美主义以及完美主义与拖延之间的关系。例如，当人们受到父母的批评时，这可能会加剧他们对完美主义的担忧，进而加剧他们的拖延症。  

Alternatively, when people have high _[self-efficacy](https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/)_, this can improve their ability to control any perfectionistic concerns that they have, which in turn can decrease their procrastination.  

或者，当人们有较高的自我效能感时，这可以提高他们控制完美主义担忧的能力，从而减少他们的拖延症。

**In summary**, perfectionism can either increase or decrease procrastination, depending on various factors.  

总之，完美主义会增加或减少拖延症，这取决于各种因素。  

These factors include the aspects of perfectionism involved (e.g., concerns vs.  

这些因素包括：完美主义所涉及的方面（例如，关注与追求）、完美主义的类型、完美主义的程度、以及完美主义的影响因素。  

strivings), the types of perfectionism involved (e.g., self-oriented vs.  

追求）、完美主义的类型（如自我导向型与社会规定型）以及性格。  

socially-prescribed), and personality traits, such as self-efficacy.  

这些因素包括完美主义所涉及的方面（如关注与追求）、完美主义所涉及的类型（如自我导向型与社会规定型）以及自我效能感等个性特征。  

This means that while perfectionism can sometimes cause procrastination, not all perfectionists procrastinate.  

这意味着，虽然完美主义有时会导致拖延，但并非所有完美主义者都会拖延。

## Associated psychological mechanisms  

相关心理机制

There are [various ways](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) in which perfectionism can lead to procrastination.  

完美主义会通过各种方式导致拖延。  

For example, it can increase the negative emotions that people experience when they make mistakes, which leads people to delay their work as a way to [delay](https://solvingprocrastination.com/emotion-regulation/) the associated [negative emotions](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z). Alternatively, perfectionism can substantially increase people’s expectations of themselves, which [increases](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) the [discrepancy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.02.059) between people’s current situation and their desired situation so much that their goals feel unattainable, which causes them to give up.  

例如，完美主义会增加人们在犯错时的负面情绪，从而导致人们拖延工作，以此来推迟相关的负面情绪。另外，完美主义也会大大提高人们对自己的期望值，从而加大人们当前状况与理想状况之间的差距，以至于他们感觉自己的目标无法实现，从而导致他们放弃。

These mechanisms can [cause people](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2012.08.006) to enter a [perfectionism-procrastination cycle](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-cycle/).  

这些机制会使人们进入完美主义-拖延症的循环。  

For example, this can happen when someone’s perfectionism makes them afraid of negative feedback, which causes them to procrastinate, which leads them to perform poorly and get negative feedback, which makes them more afraid of getting negative feedback again in the future, and so on.  

例如，当一个人的完美主义让他害怕负面反馈时，就会出现这种情况，这会导致他拖延，从而导致他表现不佳并得到负面反馈，这又会让他更加害怕将来再次得到负面反馈，如此循环往复。

## Other causes of procrastination  

造成拖延的其他原因

People can procrastinate for [many reasons](https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/) beyond perfectionism, such as [anxiety](https://solvingprocrastination.com/anxiety/), [fear of failure](https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/), and [depression](https://solvingprocrastination.com/depression/).  

除了完美主义之外，人们拖延的原因还有很多，比如焦虑、害怕失败和抑郁。  

Accordingly, although perfectionism can sometimes lead to procrastination, not all procrastinators are perfectionists, and even those who are don’t necessarily procrastinate because of their perfectionism, or _only_ because of it. Nevertheless, many [other causes of procrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/), [such as](https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013) anxiety and fear of failure, are [associated](https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941930733pt123) with perfectionism in [various ways](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384), for example by [co-occurring](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.896454) with it, or by being [involved](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z) in perfectionistic concerns.  

因此，虽然完美主义有时会导致拖延症，但并非所有拖延症患者都是完美主义者，即使是那些完美主义者，也不一定是因为完美主义而拖延，或者仅仅是因为完美主义而拖延。然而，造成拖延的许多其他原因，如焦虑和对失败的恐惧，都以不同的方式与完美主义联系在一起，例如与完美主义同时出现，或与完美主义的关注点有关。

## Perfectionistic procrastinators  

完美主义拖延症患者

There’s no universal definition for what constitutes a _perfectionistic procrastinator_. Nevertheless, this term generally refers to people who suffer from [substantial procrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/chronic-procrastination/) that’s caused primarily by their perfectionism.  

对于什么是完美主义拖延症患者，并没有一个通用的定义。不过，这个词一般指那些主要由完美主义导致的严重拖延症患者。  

For example, an artist can be considered a perfectionistic procrastinator if they unnecessarily delay publishing their work for a long time, because they worry the public won’t think it’s perfect.  

例如，如果一个艺术家因为担心公众认为其作品不完美而不必要地长期拖延作品的出版，那么他就可以被视为完美主义拖延症患者。

In addition, the term “perfectionistic procrastinator” can be when perfectionism is only one of the key causes of a person’s procrastination, in conjunction with other key causes as descriptors.  

此外，当完美主义只是导致一个人拖延的主要原因之一时，也可以使用 "完美主义拖延症患者 "这一术语，同时还可以使用其他主要原因作为描述。  

For example, if someone procrastinates due to a combination of perfectionism and depression, then they may be referred to as a _perfectionistic and depressed procrastinator_.  

例如，如果一个人的拖延症是由完美主义和抑郁共同造成的，那么他就可以被称为完美主义抑郁型拖延症患者。

## Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination  

应对完美主义拖延症

If you realize that your perfectionism is causing you to procrastinate, there are several key things that you can do about it:  

如果你意识到你的完美主义导致了你的拖延症，你可以做几件关键的事情来解决它：

-   **Set reasonable goals and standards.** This doesn’t mean that you should aim low, but rather that you should assess the situation, to determine what performance will be _[good enough](https://effectiviology.com/good-enough-is-good-enough-letting-go-of-perfectionism-to-get-things-done/)_ for you to achieve what you want and need to achieve.  
    
    制定合理的目标和标准。这并不是说你应该把目标定得很低，而是说你应该对情况进行评估，以确定什么样的表现才足以让你实现你想要和需要实现的目标。
-   **Focus on yourself, rather than on others.** Many of the issues associated with perfectionism come from caring too much about what others expect of you, or about what others will say or think.  
    
    关注自己，而不是他人。许多与完美主义相关的问题都来自于过于在意别人对你的期望，或者在意别人会怎么说或怎么想。  
    
    If this is a problem for you, then you should instead focus on goals and standards that you set for yourself, and minimize the degree to which you care about other people’s opinions.  
    
    如果这对你来说是个问题，那么你就应该专注于为自己设定的目标和标准，尽量减少对他人意见的在意程度。
-   **Question and address your fears.** For example, if you realize that you’re [afraid](https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/) of someone criticizing you for not having perfect work, you can ask yourself things such as “how likely is it that they will actually care if I make some small mistakes” or “so what if this person criticizes my work?”.  
    
    质疑并消除你的恐惧。例如，如果你意识到你害怕别人批评你的作品不够完美，你可以问自己 "如果我犯了一些小错误，他们真正关心我的可能性有多大 "或 "如果这个人批评我的作品，那又怎么样？  
    
    When doing this, it could help to use [self-distancing techniques](https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/), for example by asking yourself “why should _you_ care so about making small mistakes?” or by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.  
    
    在这样做的时候，使用自我暗示技巧可能会有所帮助，比如问自己 "为什么要这么在意犯小错呢？"或者考虑一下，如果你的朋友处于你的处境，你会给他什么建议。
-   **Consider the negative impact of your perfectionism.** For example, you might consider how your perfectionism-driven procrastination means that you’re not getting any feedback on your work, which is preventing you from making progress.  
    
    考虑完美主义的负面影响。例如，你可以考虑完美主义导致的拖延症意味着你的工作得不到任何反馈，从而阻碍了你取得进步。
-   **Give yourself permission to make mistakes.** For example, if you’re writing a paper, accept that your work won’t be perfect, especially when it comes to the first draft.  
    
    允许自己犯错。例如，如果您正在撰写论文，请接受您的作品不会完美无缺的事实，尤其是初稿。  
    
    Essentially, you should [avoid](https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013) an _all-or-nothing_ approach, both when it comes to your work, and when it comes to your attempts to reduce procrastination (i.e., don’t let _perfect_ become the enemy of _good enough_).  
    
    从根本上说，无论是在工作中，还是在试图减少拖延时，你都应该避免全有或全无的方法（即，不要让完美成为足够好的敌人）。
-   **Develop self-efficacy.** Specifically, this is your [belief](https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/) in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in [various ways](https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/), such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully.  
    
    培养自我效能感。具体来说，这是指你相信自己有能力采取实现目标所需的行动。你可以通过各种方式培养这种能力，比如确定你可以用来实现目标的策略，然后思考如何成功执行这些策略。
-   **Develop self-compassion.** Specifically, you should develop the three components of [self-compassion](https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-compassion/): _self-kindness_, which involves being nice to yourself, _common humanity_, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and [_mindfulness_](https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-study-mindfulness/), which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner. There are [many techniques](https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-compassion/) for doing this, including some that are particularly relevant in the case of perfectionism, such as changing your critical self-talk to make it more positive and compassionate.  
    
    培养自我同情。具体来说，你应该培养自我同情的三个组成部分：自我善待，即善待自己；共同人性，即认识到每个人都会遇到挑战；正念，即以不加评判的方式接受自己的情绪。要做到这一点，有很多技巧，包括一些与完美主义特别相关的技巧，比如改变你挑剔的自我对话，使其更加积极和富有同情心。
-   **Get support and encouragement from others.** For example, you can talk with a professional therapist about your perfectionistic concerns, or you can ask a friend to be by your side and motivate you when it’s time to act.  
    
    获得他人的支持和鼓励。例如，你可以向专业治疗师倾诉你对完美主义的担忧，也可以请朋友陪伴在你身边，在该行动的时候给你鼓励。  
    
    If you’re reluctant to ask for help because of your perfectionism, remind yourself that it’s perfectly fine and normal to ask for help, and that doing so can help you achieve better outcomes and feel better in the long term.  
    
    如果你因为完美主义而不愿意寻求帮助，那么请提醒自己，寻求帮助是完全正常的，而且这样做可以帮助你取得更好的结果，从长远来看也会让你感觉更好。

Before choosing which of these techniques to use, you should assess your perfectionism and procrastination, to understand how they’re connected.  

在选择使用这些技巧之前，你应该评估一下自己的完美主义和拖延症，了解它们之间的联系。  

This can help you figure out which specific aspects of your perfectionism you should address and how you should address them.  

这可以帮助你找出应该解决完美主义的哪些具体方面，以及应该如何解决。

In addition, there are many other [anti-procrastination techniques](https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/) that you might benefit from using to reduce your perfectionism-driven procrastination.  

此外，还有许多其他的反拖延技巧，你可以从中受益，减少完美主义导致的拖延。  

These include the following:  

其中包括

-   **Break your work into small and manageable steps.** For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction.  
    
    将工作分成易于管理的小步骤。例如，如果你有一个大型项目，感觉难以应付，如撰写研究论文，你可以将其分解成一系列小步骤，如创建大纲、查找相关资源和撰写引言。
-   **Start with a tiny step.** For example, commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started.  
    
    从一小步开始。例如，承诺只写一句话或只锻炼两分钟，同时允许自己在迈出这微小的第一步后就停止，以减轻与开始有关的压力。
-   **Switch between tasks.** For example, if you’re stuck on a task and can’t make progress, switch to a [different task](https://solvingprocrastination.com/productive-procrastination/) until you’re ready to go back to the first one.  
    
    在任务之间切换。例如，如果你在某项任务上卡住了，无法取得进展，就切换到另一项任务，直到你准备好回到第一项任务。
-   **Acknowledge and reward your progress.** For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you’ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row.  
    
    承认并奖励自己的进步。例如，当你连续一周实现学习目标时，你可以给自己一些愉快的奖励。
-   **Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles.** For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible.  
    
    根据自己的工作效率周期安排工作。例如，如果你觉得早上更容易集中精力完成创造性的任务，那么你就应该尽可能把这类任务安排在这个时间段。
-   **Improve your work environment.** For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter.  
    
    改善工作环境。例如，如果你目前的工作环境有很多恼人的背景噪音，那就买个降噪耳机或去更安静的地方。
-   **Get enough rest.** For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don’t get burnt out.  
    
    充分休息。例如，如果你需要努力完成需要高度集中注意力的任务，一定要保证足够的休息时间，以免疲惫不堪。  
    
    To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing.  
    
    为了鼓励自己做到这一点，你可以提醒自己，即使休息会在短期内降低你的工作效率，但从长远来看，这往往对你的工作效率和身心健康都大有裨益。
-   **Forgive yourself for past procrastination.** For example, if you need to get started on a task that you’ve been postponing for a long time, you can say “I shouldn’t have postponed this task in the first place, but that’s in the past, and what’s important now is to move on and just get this done”.  
    
    原谅自己过去的拖延。例如，如果你需要着手完成一项已经拖延了很久的任务，你可以说："我本来就不应该推迟这项任务，但那已经是过去的事了，现在最重要的是继续前进，完成这项任务。

Before using these techniques, you should figure out [why you procrastinate](https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/), especially if there are other reasons for your procrastination beyond perfectionism, as well as when and how you procrastinate.  

在使用这些技巧之前，你应该弄清楚自己为什么会拖延，特别是除了完美主义之外，是否还有其他原因导致你拖延，以及你是在什么时候和如何拖延的。  

This will then help you find the best [anti-procrastination techniques](https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/) to use in your particular situation, and will also figure out how to use these techniques as effectively as possible.  

这将帮助你找到最适合你的具体情况的反拖延技巧，也将帮助你找出如何尽可能有效地使用这些技巧。

## Misunderstandings about insurance  

对保险的误解

People online sometimes ask if they should get some insurance, and then other people say incorrect things, like  

人们有时会在网上询问是否应该购买保险，然后其他人会说一些不正确的话，比如1<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">1</sup> These are real quotes from just one forum discussion.

Some answers were even worse, but I’ve picked out a representative sample.  

有些答案甚至更糟，但我还是挑出了一个有代表性的样本。

These are the things I would say in response.  

这些都是我的回答。

-   It is not a philosophical question, it is a mathematical one.  
    
    这不是一个哲学问题，而是一个数学问题。
-   Technically, some insurance is worth its price, _even when_ the insurance company makes a profit.  
    
    从技术上讲，有些保险即使在保险公司盈利的情况下也是物有所值的。
-   Whether or not to get insurance should have nothing to do with what makes one sleep – again, it is a mathematical decision with a correct answer.  
    
    买不买保险与睡不睡得着没有任何关系--同样，这是一个有正确答案的数学决定。
-   Saving up the premium instead of getting insurance is making the mistake of conflating an ensemble average with a time average.  
    
    攒保费而不是买保险，是把总体平均值和时间平均值混为一谈。
-   Love does not make insurance a mathematically appropriate decision. Running the numbers does.  
    
    爱并不能使保险成为一个数学上合适的决定。计算数字才是。

The last quote (“things you cannot afford to lose”) is the closest to being true, but it doesn’t define exactly what it means to afford to lose something, so it ends up recommending a decision based on vibes anyway, which is wrong.  

最后一句话（"你输不起的东西"）最接近真理，但它并没有准确定义 "输不起的东西 "是什么意思，所以它最终还是建议根据感觉来做决定，这是不对的。  

In order to be able to make the insurance decision wisely, we need to know what the purpose of insurance really is.  

为了能够明智地做出保险决定，我们需要了解保险的真正目的是什么。  

Most people do not know this, even when they think they do.  

大多数人都不知道这一点，即使他们自以为知道。

## The purpose of insurance  

保险的目的

The purpose if insurance is _not_ to help us pay for things that we literally do not have enough money to pay for.  

保险的目的不是帮助我们支付那些我们根本没有足够资金支付的费用。  

It does help in that situation, but the purpose of insurance is much broader than that.  

在这种情况下，保险确实有帮助，但保险的目的远不止于此。  

What insurance does is help us avoid large drawndowns on our accumulated wealth, in order for our wealth to gather compound interest faster.  

保险的作用是帮助我们避免积累的财富大量缩水，使我们的财富更快地积累复利。  

Think about that. _Even though insurance is an expected loss_, it helps us earn more money in the long run. This comes back to the [Kelly criterion](https://entropicthoughts.com/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.html), which teaches us that the compounding effects on wealth can make it worth paying a little up front to avoid a potential large loss later.  

想想吧。尽管保险是一种预期损失，但从长远来看，它能帮助我们赚更多的钱。这又回到了凯利标准，它告诉我们，财富的复利效应可以使我们值得在前期付出一点，以避免日后可能出现的巨大损失。2<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">2</sup> The typical example is how it takes as long to go from $2,000 to $10,000 as it does from $10,000 to $50,000.  

<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">2</sup> 典型的例子是，从 2,000 美元到 10,000 美元所需的时间与从 10,000 美元到 50,000 美元所需的时间一样长。  

This means that if we are forced to pay $8,000 out of our $10,000 wealth, we will end up with $10,000 again at the same time as we would have ended up with $50,000 if we had not been forced to pay.  

这意味着，如果我们被迫从 10 000 美元的财富中支付 8 000 美元，我们最终将再次拥有 10 000 美元，与此同时，如果我们没有被迫支付，我们最终将拥有 50 000 美元。  

Losing $8,000 at one point is equal to a $40,000 loss later on, once compounding is taken into account.  

一次损失 8,000 美元，一旦考虑到复利因素，就等于以后损失 40,000 美元。  

No wonder Einstein coined compounding the eighth wonder of the world. This effect is huge.  

难怪爱因斯坦将复利称为世界第八大奇迹。这种效应是巨大的。  

Having to shell out 20 % of our wealth for an unexpected accident is so bad – even if the accident is improbable – that we may want to chuck out a guaranteed 0.5 % of our wealth to get out of that risk.  

要为一场突如其来的事故拿出 20% 的财富是一件非常糟糕的事情--即使事故不可能发生--以至于我们可能想拿出 0.5% 的保底财富来摆脱这种风险。

_This_ is the hidden purpose of insurance.  

这就是保险的隐藏目的。  

It’s great at protecting us against losses which we literally cannot cover with our own money, but it also protects us against losses which set our wealth back far enough that we lose out on significant compounding effects.  

它能很好地保护我们免受损失，而这些损失是我们用自己的钱根本无法弥补的，但它也能保护我们免受损失，因为损失会使我们的财富大幅缩水，从而失去显著的复利效应。  

To determine where the threshold for large enough losses is, we need to calculate.  

为了确定损失足够大的临界值，我们需要计算一下。

## Computing when insurance is worth it  

计算保险的价值

The Kelly criterion is not just a general idea, but [a specific mathematical relationship](https://entropicthoughts.com/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.html). We can use this to determine when insurance is worth it. We need to know some numbers:  

凯利标准并不只是一个笼统的概念，而是一个具体的数学关系。我们可以用它来确定何时值得购买保险。我们需要知道一些数字：

-   What is our current wealth ?  
    
    我们目前的财富是多少 ？
-   How much is the premium ?  
    
    保险费是多少？

Then we need to estimate the probability distribution of the bad events that could occur.  

然后，我们需要估计可能发生的坏事件的概率分布。3<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">3</sup> In what follows we assume these events form a partition, i.e. that they are mutually exclusive.  

<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">3</sup> 在下文中，我们假设这些事件 构成一个分区，即它们是相互排斥的。  

If we think multiple bad things can happen at once, we’ll have to model that by including some virtual events that are compositions of other events.  

如果我们认为可能同时发生多件坏事，那么我们就必须通过包含一些由其他事件组成的虚拟事件 来建立模型。 In other words, for each bad event we can think of, we estimate  

换句话说，对于我们能想到的每一个坏事件 ，我们都要估计出

-   What is the probability that this event happens? and  
    
    该事件发生的概率 是多少？
-   If it does happen, what would be the uninsured cost ?  
    
    如果发生这种情况，未投保的费用是多少 ？

We’re going to ignore the deductible for now because it makes the equation more complicated, but we’ll get back to it.  

我们暂时不考虑免赔额，因为它使等式变得更加复杂，但我们会再讨论它。  

We plug these numbers into the equation  

我们将这些数字输入等式4<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">4</sup> For information on how this is derived, [see the previous article on the Kelly criterion](https://entropicthoughts.com/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.html).  

<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="5b32becf-6f3e-42f2-8ccc-9503b649146a">4</sup> 有关如何得出这一结论的信息，请参阅之前有关凯利准则的文章。 for the value of the insurance to someone in our situation:  

保险对我们这种情况的人的价值：

If this number is positive, then the insurance is worth it.  

如果这个数字是正数，那么保险就是值得的。  

If it is negative, we would do better to pay the costs out of our own pockets.  

如果是负数，我们最好自掏腰包。

## Motorcycle insurance  

摩托车保险

In a concrete example, let’s say that our household wealth is $25,000, and we’ve just gotten a motorcycle with some miles on it already.  

举个具体的例子，假设我们的家庭财富是 25,000 美元，我们刚买了一辆摩托车，已经行驶了一些里程。  

Insuring this motorcycle against all repairs would cost $900 per year.  

为这辆摩托车购买所有维修保险每年将花费 900 美元。  

We might think of two bad events:  

我们可能会想到两件坏事：

-   It ends up needing expensive maintenance due to its age.  
    
    由于年久失修，最终需要昂贵的维护费用。  
    
    We expect this to happen once in the next three years, meaning there’s roughly a 33 % probability it’s needed the next year.  
    
    我们预计这种情况在未来三年内会发生一次，这意味着下一年需要这样做的可能性大约为 33%。  
    
    This costs maybe $2000.  
    
    这大概需要 2000 美元。
-   We end up riding irresponsibly and wreck it, or it gets stolen, or somehow needs to be replaced completely.  
    
    我们不负责任地骑车，结果把车撞坏了，或者被偷了，或者不知何故需要彻底更换。  
    
    Maybe there’s a 1/40 risk of this any given year, and it would cost $8000.  
    
    也许任何一年都有 1/40 的风险，而这需要花费 8000 美元。

Assuming no deductible, would this be worth it? Yes!  

假设没有免赔额，这值得吗？值得！  

Solving the equation – or entering the parameters into the [Kelly insurance calculator](https://xkqr.org/insurance) – we see that we should be willing to pay a premium of up to $912 in this situation.  

解方程，或者将参数输入凯利保险计算器，我们可以看到，在这种情况下，我们应该愿意支付高达 912 美元的保险费。  

If our wealth had been $32,000 instead, the insurance would no longer have been worth it – in that situation, we should not spend more than $899 on it, but the premium offered is $900.  

如果我们的财富是 32 000 美元，保险就不再值得购买--在这种情况下，我们购买保险的花费不应超过 899 美元，但提供的保费是 900 美元。

## The effect of the deductible  

免赔额的影响

In the same example as above, now set a fixed deductible of $500 for both events, and watch the value of the insurance plummet!  

在上述同样的例子中，现在为这两个事件设定一个 500 美元的固定免赔额，然后看着保险的价值急剧下降！  

Under those terms, we should only accept the insurance if our wealth is less than $10,000.  

根据这些条款，只有当我们的财富低于 10 000 美元时，我们才应该接受保险。

We can put a fixed deductible into the equation as such:  

我们可以将固定的免赔额 加入等式中：

If the deductible varies based on the event , the sum in the second term can be taken over the appropriate probability-weighted logarithm instead.  

如果免赔额因事件 而异，则第二项中的总和可以用适当的概率加权对数来代替。  

## Helicopter hovering exercise  

直升机悬停演习

To test your knowledge, we’ll run with one more example.  

为了测试你的知识水平，我们再举一个例子。

Let’s say you get the opportunity to try to hover a helicopter close to ground, for whatever reason.  

比方说，不管出于什么原因，你都有机会尝试让直升机贴近地面盘旋。  

There’s a real pilot next to you who will take control when you screw up (because hovering a helicopter is hard!) However, there’s a small (2 %) chance you will screw up so bad the other pilot won’t be able to recover control and you crash the helicopter.  

你旁边有一位真正的飞行员，当你搞砸时，他会接管你的控制权（因为悬停直升机很难！）。不过，也有很小的几率（2%）你会搞砸，以至于其他飞行员无法恢复控制权，导致直升机坠毁。  

You will be fine, but you will have to pay $10,000 kr to repair the helicopter, if that happens.  

你会没事的，但如果发生这种情况，你必须支付 10,000 克朗来修理直升机。

You can get insurance before you go, which will cover $6,000 of helicopter damage (so even with insurance, you have to pay $4,000 in addition to the insurance premium if you crash), but cost you $150 up front.  

您可以在出发前购买保险，这将为直升机损失提供 6000 美元的赔偿（因此，即使购买了保险，如果失事，您还需要支付 4000 美元的保险费），但需要先支付 150 美元。  

Do you take it?  

你要吗？

You probably know by now: it depends on your wealth!  

你现在可能已经知道：这取决于你的财富！  

There’s a specific number of dollars in the bank you need to have to skip the insurance.  

要想跳过保险，银行里必须有特定数目的美元。  

Whipping out the [Kelly insurance calculator](https://xkqr.org/insurance), we figure it out to be $34,700. Wealthier than that? Okay, skip the insurance.  

拿出凯利保险计算器，我们算出是 34,700 美元。比这还富裕？好吧，不买保险了。  

Have less than that? It’s wise to take the offer up.  

少于这个数？接受提议是明智之举。

## It’s not that hard  

没那么难

I am surprised not more people are talking about this.  

我很惊讶没有更多的人讨论这个问题。  

Everyone goes around making insurance decisions on vibes, even as these decisions can be quite consequential and involve a lot of money.  

每个人都会根据感觉做出保险决定，尽管这些决定可能会产生相当大的影响，并涉及大量资金。  

There’s just a general assumption that insurance decisions are incalculable – but the industry has calculated with them for at least seventy years!  

人们普遍认为保险决策是不可估量的，但保险业至少七十年来一直在计算保险决策！  

Are people not a little curious how they do it?  

人们难道不好奇他们是如何做到的吗？

More specifically: until now, there has been no insurance calculator that actually uses the Kelly criterion.  

更具体地说：到目前为止，还没有一个保险计算器真正使用凯利标准。  

All others use loose heuristics. Who thinks that leads to better decisions?  

所有其他人都使用松散的启发式方法。谁认为这会带来更好的决策？

## Appendix A: Anticipated and actual criticism  

附录 A：预期批评和实际批评

I think there are two major points of disagreement possible in the description above:  

我认为上述描述可能存在两大分歧点：

1.  The Kelly criterion is bad, and  
    
    凯利标准很糟糕，而且
2.  The probability distribution of bad events is unknown.  
    
    坏事件的概率分布是未知的。

Both of these points are technically true, but not as meaningful as their proponents seem to think.  

从技术上讲，这两点都是正确的，但并不像其支持者似乎认为的那样有意义。

Yes, the Kelly criterion is too aggressive for most people, who do not value maximum growth over all else.  

是的，对大多数人来说，凯利标准过于激进，因为他们并不把最大增长看得比什么都重要。  

Most people want to trade off some growth against security.  

大多数人都希望用增长来换取安全。  

The correct response here is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and ignore Kelly entirely – the correct response is to use a fractional Kelly allocation.  

正确的对策不是把孩子和洗澡水一起倒掉，完全忽略凯利--正确的对策是使用部分凯利分配法。  

This can be done quite easily by entering a lower wealth in the [Kelly insurance calculator](https://xkqr.org/insurance). See [the Kelly article](https://entropicthoughts.com/the-misunderstood-kelly-criterion.html) for more discussion on this.  

在凯利保险计算器中输入一个较低的财富值，就可以轻松做到这一点。有关这方面的更多讨论，请参阅凯利文章。

The probability distribution of _anything_ is unknown, but this is not a problem.  

任何事物的概率分布都是未知的，但这不是问题。  

Good forecasters estimate accurate probabilities all the time, and nearly [anyone can learn to do it](https://entropicthoughts.com/improving-a-gut-feeling-forecast.html).  

优秀的预报员总是能估算出准确的概率，几乎任何人都能学会。

But, perhaps most fatally, the people who oppose the method suggested in this article have not yet proposed a better alternative.  

但是，也许最致命的是，反对本文所建议方法的人还没有提出更好的替代方案。  

They tend to base their insurance decisions on one of the incorrect superstitions that opened this article.  

他们往往会根据本文开篇提到的一种不正确的迷信做出保险决定。  

## Appendix B: How insurance companies make money  

附录 B：保险公司如何赚钱

The reason all this works is that the insurance company has way more money than we do.  

这一切之所以行得通，是因为保险公司的钱比我们多得多。  

If we enter the motorcycle example with no deductible into the Kelly insurance calculator again, and increase our wealth by a factor of ten, we see the break-even point moves down to $863.  

如果我们再次将无免赔额的摩托车例子输入凯利保险计算器，并将我们的财富增加 10 倍，我们会发现盈亏平衡点下降到 863 美元。  

This is the point where the insurance _starts_ being worth offering for someone with 10× our wealth!  

这时候，保险就开始值得为拥有我们 10 倍财富的人提供了！

In other words, when someone with 10× our wealth meets us, and we agree on motorcycle insurance for $900, _we_ have made a $12 profit _and_ the insurer has made a $37 profit.  

换句话说，当一个拥有我们 10 倍财富的人与我们见面，并且我们同意以 900 美元的价格购买摩托车保险时，我们赚了 12 美元，保险公司赚了 37 美元。

It sounds crazy, but that’s the effect of the asymmetric nature of differential capital under compounding.  

这听起来很疯狂，但这就是复利计算下差额资本不对称的影响。  

This is the beauty of insurance: deals are struck at premiums that profit _both_ parties of the deal.  

这就是保险的魅力所在：交易双方都能从中获利。

## Appendix C: The relativity of costs  

附录 C：费用的相对性

The clever reader will also see that if we set the deductible to be event-dependent, and create a virtual event for when nothing bad happens (this event has a deductible and cost of zero), a lot of the terms are similar and can be combined.  

聪明的读者也会发现，如果我们将免赔额设置为与事件相关，并创建一个虚拟事件，当没有任何坏事发生时（该事件的免赔额和成本为零），很多术语都是相似的，可以合并使用。  

Indeed, the equation can then be given as  

事实上，方程可以表示为

This, perhaps, makes it clear that it is not the absolute size of the wealth that matters, but its size in proportion to the premium, deductible, and cost of events.  

这或许清楚地表明，重要的不是财富的绝对规模，而是其规模与保费、免赔额和事件费用的比例。

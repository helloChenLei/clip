It’s hard to really take in, after all these years, that most people have no memory of the day.  

经过这么多年，真的很难相信大多数人对那一天毫无记忆。  

The majority of people in the world were either not born, or not old enough to be aware of what was going on, and then many who would recall are either gone or their memories have faded.  

世界上大多数人要么没有出生，要么年纪太小，无法意识到发生了什么，而许多能够回忆的人要么已经去世，要么他们的记忆已经模糊不清。  

But I was in New York City on September 11, 2001, and I can say definitively: The constructed cultural narrative around the day bears almost no resemblance to the actual lived experience of anyone I know who was here that day.  

但我在 2001 年 9 月 11 日的纽约市，我可以明确地说：关于这一天的文化叙事几乎与我所认识的任何在那天在这里的人们的真实经历毫无相似之处。  

So maybe it’s worth telling a little bit of what I actually saw.  

所以也许值得分享一下我所看到的事情。

At the time, I [worked at the Village Voice](https://www.anildash.com/2024/06/14/the-new-alt-media/), which was the most famous alt-weekly media outlet, a then highly-influential news outlet for people who cared about culture and the arts and progressive politics.  

那时，我在《乡村之声》工作，这是最著名的另类周刊媒体，也是一个对文化、艺术和进步政治感兴趣的人们非常有影响力的新闻平台。  

I suspect that much of my perspective on the day and the days that followed were informed by working in a newsroom alongside people who were witnessing the most dramatic aspects of the event.  

我怀疑我对那天及其后几天的看法，主要是受到与目睹事件最戏剧性部分的人们在新闻编辑室共事的影响。

I’d gone to bed at 2 or 3 in the morning, working on some problem with the website whose specifics I’ve since forgotten.  

我是在早上 2 点或 3 点上床睡觉的，当时正在解决一个我现在已经忘记具体细节的网站问题。  

I didn’t remember to turn off my alarm, so it went off as usual a little before 9AM.  

我忘记关闹钟了，所以它像往常一样在早上 9 点前响起。  

My alarm was set to play a local radio station, and as I started to wake up and get ready, they interrupted the broadcast to mention that a plane had hit one of the World Trade Center towers.  

我的闹钟设定为播放当地的广播电台，当我开始醒来并准备时，他们中断了节目，提到一架飞机撞上了世界贸易中心的一座塔楼。  

It was mentioned like a serious traffic crash, something significant but not overly worrisome; there were always small planes around NYC airspace and it wasn’t that unusual to have accidents from time to time.  

这被描述为一起严重的交通事故，虽然重要但并不令人过于担忧；在纽约市的空域中，小型飞机时常出现，偶尔发生事故并不算太罕见。  

Until a few months prior I’d worked at the Empire State Building, and one of the first bits of lore they shared when you worked in the building was about all the weird incidents with planes and dirigibles that had tangled with the building.  

几个月前，我在帝国大厦工作。当时，他们分享的第一个传说就是关于与大厦发生过奇怪纠缠的飞机和飞艇的事件。  

I didn’t honestly think much about it, and assumed it was some hapless private pilot that had messed up while sightseeing.  

我其实没怎么在意这件事，只是认为是某个倒霉的私人飞行员在观光时出错了。

Just a few moments later, it was clear that [every single thing had changed](https://www.anildash.com/2001/09/12/everythings_cha/).  

不久之后，显然一切都发生了变化。

I turned on the TV when I heard the news, a method of getting information that dated back to my 20th century habits, but which I would soon permanently discard.  

我听到新闻时打开了电视，这种获取信息的方法源于我 20 世纪的习惯，但我很快就会彻底放弃它。  

Every channel had changed over to a live broadcast of the burning towers, with all manner of confused response and very careful, measured language accurately describing only what was painfully obvious and clear, with a noticeable attempt not to speculate.  

每个频道都在直播燃烧的塔楼，反应各异，语言小心谨慎，只准确描述那些显而易见的事实，并明显避免进行推测。  

I was in my apartment uptown in Spanish Harlem, and my roommate had already gone off a while earlier to his office in midtown.  

我在西哈莱姆的公寓里，我的室友早已去中城的办公室了。

I sat down on my couch with my laptop and started to see what I could find out online, and instantly my messaging app (in those days we used a tool called AOL Instant Messenger, where each new message from a different person got its own window on your computer) had blown up, and my screen was covered in brief messages from online friends checking in.  

我坐在沙发上，打开笔记本电脑，开始在网上查找信息。瞬间，我的消息应用程序（那时我们用的是 AOL 即时消息，每个不同人的新消息都会在电脑上弹出一个新窗口）就被刷屏了，屏幕上满是在线朋友们发来的简短问候。  

Almost nobody in the U.S. used SMS or text messaging of any kind back then, and people you knew "online" were considered a sort of different, not really real relationship.  

当时，美国几乎没有人使用短信或任何形式的文本消息，而你在“网上”认识的人被视为一种不同的、不太真实的关系。  

So I cared about these people, and they obviously cared about me, but there was a sense of stigma or distance to the fact that these were the folks who were checking in on me.  

所以我关心这些人，他们显然也关心我，但我感觉到他们对我有一种污名或距离感。  

Though my first reaction on the day was to [thank everyone](https://www.anildash.com/2001/09/11/thank_you/) for checking in, the feeling I remember most was from a few hours later, when I felt so desperately alone and [deeply wished](https://www.anildash.com/2001/09/12/i_wish/) I had someone to hold on to.  

尽管我当天的第一反应是感谢每一个关心我的人，但我最深刻的感受是几个小时后，当我感到无比孤独，真心希望能有一个人可以依偎。  

I had gone through the usual sorts of relationship dramas one endures in their early 20s, and had been through a breakup not long before, and the profound sense of not having anyone around was pervasive.  

我经历了 20 多岁时常见的各种感情戏剧，最近刚经历了一次分手，周围没有人的孤独感无处不在。  

Later, many of the people who checked in on me that day, who'd been those "imaginary" online friends, became the people who introduced me to my wife, who greeted my child, who held me when I grieved, who rejoiced as we built careers and lives together.  

后来，那天关心我的许多人，那些“虚拟”的在线朋友，成了介绍我认识我妻子的人，迎接我孩子的人，在我悲伤时安慰我的人，以及和我一起庆祝我们共同建立事业和生活的人。

Shortly after the news had broken, I had gone outside into the street. We all did.  

消息传出后不久，我走到街上。我们大家都是这样做的。  

Everyone poured out onto the sidewalks and into the streets themselves (all traffic was shut down in a way that we wouldn’t see again until Covid hit).  

每个人都涌上人行道和街道（所有交通都被封锁，这种情况直到新冠疫情爆发前都没有见过）。  

We were in the parks and at the subway stations, lined up at the hospitals to give blood, and by later in the afternoon, lined up at the mosques in the neighborhood to stand guard together.  

我们在公园和地铁站，排队在医院献血，下午时分又在附近的清真寺排队一起守护。  

I spent a while at a nearby bodega joining a few people who were handing out glasses of water to the dust-covered folks who had by then walked all the way from their offices downtown, still shell-shocked and with everyone fruitlessly asking around for a phone that still had service.  

我在附近的一家杂货店待了一会儿，和一些人一起给那些满身尘土的人发水。他们已经从市中心的办公室走过来，仍然感到震惊，大家都在徒劳地寻找有信号的电话。  

I’ve still, to this day, never hugged as many strangers as I did that afternoon.  

直到今天，我还从未像那天下午那样拥抱过这么多陌生人。

By later in the day, a few friends in the neighborhood had reached out, and my roommate came back home.  

到了晚上，邻居的几个朋友联系了我，我的室友也回来了。  

He had watched, through the window of his office, the second tower fall. Not on TV. Not on video.  

他透过办公室的窗户目睹了第二座塔的倒塌。不是在电视上，也不是在视频里。  

He’d seen it firsthand, as it happened.  

他亲眼目睹了这一切的发生。  

Later I would find so many more friends who had been through similar trauma, let alone those who had loved ones in the towers.  

后来我发现还有很多经历过类似创伤的朋友，更不用说那些在塔楼里有亲人的人了。  

A thing that’s been lost to time in the many years since is that, for quite a long while, we thought the towers had already been full of workers that day.  

很久以前被时间遗忘的一件事是，我们曾认为那天塔楼里已经挤满了工人。  

Tens of thousands of people might be in the area at its peak occupancy, and we were fearing, maybe even assuming that casualties would number that high.  

在高峰时段，可能会有成千上万的人在这个地区，我们担心，甚至假设伤亡人数会如此之高。

That wasn’t the only thing we were wrong about.  

这并不是我们唯一的错误。  

Everything in those first early days was focused on rescue, on recovery.  

在那些早期的日子里，所有的工作都专注于救援和恢复。  

People were mobilizing dogs and equipment and medical teams, and the reason everyone was giving blood was because of course they were going to find survivors.  

人们正在动员狗、设备和医疗团队，大家献血的原因显然是希望能找到幸存者。  

They were going to find those miraculous stories to give us hope.  

他们要寻找那些充满奇迹的故事，以带给我们希望。  

By a few weeks later, long after I’d stopped watching televised news, they were doing stories about how they had volunteers pretending to be survivors who would hide themselves in the wreckage of the collapsed towers, so that the dogs could "find" them, in hopes of keeping the rescue dogs from getting too depressed.  

几周后，在我停止观看电视新闻很久之后，他们报道了志愿者假装成幸存者，躲在倒塌的塔楼废墟中，让搜救犬“找到”他们，以期防止这些救援犬感到过于沮丧。

## Love’s In Need of Love Today  

今天的爱需要被爱

But amidst the obvious, overwhelming grief, my strongest memory of that time was of a feeling that can only be described as a deep and abiding love.  

然而，在那种明显而压倒性的悲痛中，我对那段时间最深刻的记忆是那种深沉而持久的爱的感觉。  

There was a profound, shared humanity, and extraordinary kindness was shared between complete strangers on an unconditional basis, for days and weeks on end.  

在无条件的基础上，完全陌生人之间分享了深厚的人性和非凡的善良，这种情感持续了数天甚至数周。  

It sounds like a fairy tale, or the kind of thing that happens in a movie, or that would get dismissed as impossible by the "smart", cynical view.  

这听起来像是一个童话，或者是电影中会发生的情节，或者会被“聪明”的、愤世嫉俗的人视为不可能的事情。

It really did, happen, though.  

这确实发生过。  

People went through an unimaginable trauma, and an impossible circumstance, and we genuinely spent hours or even days thinking it might be the end of the world, and the reaction that happened was that people came together spontaneously to take care of each other in ways both minuscule and profound.  

人们经历了难以想象的创伤和不可能的境遇，我们真的花了几个小时甚至几天的时间思考这可能是世界的尽头，结果是人们自发地聚在一起，以微小而深刻的方式相互关心。  

The worries seem so extreme with all the time that’s passed, but a thing to keep in mind is that, at that time, very few people had ever gotten their news on the internet before.  

随着时间的推移，担忧似乎变得非常严重，但要记住的是，在那个时候，几乎没有人通过互联网获取新闻。  

They were just watching cable TV or reading newspapers.  

他们只是看着有线电视或在看报纸。  

Suddenly, they were constantly updating the windows they had opened to different news sites (browsers didn’t have tabs yet) and they had no idea how to discern what was valid.  

突然间，他们不停地更新打开的不同新闻网站的窗口（当时浏览器还没有标签），却不知道如何判断哪些信息是有效的。  

If you think today’s boomers get their brains fried by Fox News and Facebook, imagine people a full generation older, some of them born before electricity was widely available, getting completely unvetted and unfiltered messages flooding their email inboxes.  

如果你觉得今天的婴儿潮一代被福克斯新闻和脸书搞得脑袋发昏，那想象一下比他们大一整代的人，有些人甚至在电力普及之前就出生，完全没有经过审查和过滤的信息涌入他们的电子邮件收件箱。  

I’m not surprised that it only took [one day](https://www.anildash.com/2001/09/13/fight_the_hoaxe/) for me to begin angrily posting about misinformation. Especially when rumors involved [the security dog at the Empire State Building](https://www.anildash.com/2001/09/13/remy/) that I had become friends with.  

我并不感到惊讶，居然只花了一天我就开始愤怒地发帖讨论错误信息。尤其是当谣言涉及到我已经交了朋友的帝国大厦的保安犬时。

Despite that chaotic information environment, the deep and abiding memory I have of the time is of New Yorkers extending each other an unimaginable kindness, grace, and compassion.  

尽管信息环境混乱，我对那段时间的深刻记忆是纽约人之间展现出的难以想象的善良、优雅和同情。  

On the day, there were grand gestures of giving people a place to sleep, or a change of clothes, or packing up food for someone who they had never met before so that they’d be able to eat as they tried to figure out a way home.  

在那一天，人们慷慨地为陌生人提供了睡觉的地方、换洗的衣服，或者准备食物，让他们在寻找回家路的过程中能够吃上东西。  

But there were smaller things too, like people pushing a tired mom’s baby stroller through the beautiful early autumn weather, or what looked like almost a parody of interfaith harmony as people of different religions gathered to worship and spend time together, each dressed like an illustration in a kids’ storybook.  

但也有一些小事，比如人们在美丽的初秋天气中推着疲惫的妈妈的婴儿车，或者几乎像是对宗教间和谐的讽刺，不同信仰的人们聚在一起崇拜和共度时光，每个人的打扮都像是儿童故事书中的插图。  

It would be dismissed as unbelievably corny now, but people got together to sing things like the national anthem or God Bless America and it was perfectly earnest and heartfelt and even appreciated.  

现在可能会被视为非常老套，但人们曾聚在一起唱国歌或《上帝保佑美国》，那时的情感是真诚而热烈的，甚至得到了大家的赞赏。  

Part of what was so amazing and what left such an impression was that everyone let go of their cynicism and everyone was brave enough to be vulnerable.  

令人惊叹的是，大家都放下了愤世嫉俗，勇敢地展现了自己的脆弱，这给人留下了深刻的印象。

By the time they did a telethon fundraiser for first responders a few weeks later, it opened with Steve Wonder doing his wonderful classic, "Love’s In Need of Love Today", and I broke down in tears again, because we had finally arrived at a moment where it felt like everyone around me, everyone I saw on the street, was living the kind of pure and idealistic reality that he had always been singing about.  

当他们几周后为第一响应者举办电话募捐活动时，开场是史蒂夫·旺达演唱他那首经典的《爱的需要爱》，我再次泪流满面，因为我们终于迎来了一个时刻，感觉周围的每一个人，街上我看到的每一个人，都在过着他一直歌唱的那种纯粹而理想的生活。

That was the emotional context, but there was also the visceral, sensory experience of being around those days.  

那是情感的背景，但在那些日子里，还有一种强烈的感官体验。  

The most pervasive part was the acrid, searing smell of electrical fire, from the smoldering rubble pile that would keep burning downtown for the better part of a year.  

最让人印象深刻的是那刺鼻而灼热的电气火灾气味，来自于那堆冒烟的废墟，这些废墟在市中心燃烧了近一年。  

It pervaded everything, and you could be almost anywhere in town and the wind would change and then suddenly the smell would catch you off guard and you’d be crying again.  

它弥漫在每个角落，你几乎可以在城镇的任何地方，风一转，突然间那股气味就会让你感到意外，你又会忍不住哭泣。  

Anyone who says they were here then, and doesn’t mention the smell… well, they’re flat out lying.  

任何声称他们当时在这里的人，如果不提到那股气味……那么，他们就是在撒谎。

Every public space was papered in flyers listing those who were "missing", all in similar designs, featuring whatever photo people had most recently scanned of their loved one.  

每个公共场所都贴满了列出“失踪”人员的传单，设计相似，展示了人们最近扫描的亲人照片。  

In those first 48 hours, every subway stop and telephone pole and bus station was covered, and then the thin copier paper almost immediately began to break down.  

在最初的 48 小时内，每个地铁站、电话杆和公交车站都被贴满了海报，而薄薄的复印纸几乎立刻就开始 deteriorate。  

The decaying and torn posters with photos of people’s loved ones were reduced to tatters just as quickly as we all realized that nobody would be getting dug out of that rubble pile.  

破旧撕裂的海报上贴着人们所爱之人的照片，随着我们意识到没有人能从那堆瓦砾中被救出来，它们很快就变得支离破碎。

It only took days for public spaces to be fully occupied by soldiers with long guns, a full occupying force that was the first sign of the new militarized reality that broke through the camaraderie and care that everyone was showing to each other.  

仅仅几天，公共空间就被持长枪的士兵完全占领，这支全面的占领部队是新军事化现实的第一个迹象，打破了人们之间的友谊与关心。  

Though I had stopped watching TV, I knew from walking by store fronts and overhearing conversations that the rest of the country had fully moved on to beating the drums for war and violence, using our city as their pretense.  

尽管我已经不再看电视，但从路过商店橱窗和听到的谈话中，我知道全国其他地方的人们已经完全转向为战争和暴力鼓动，以我们的城市作为他们的借口。  

I grew increasingly protective and defensive about New York City, about what it means to those of us who live here, and to this day I have a white-hot resentment of how our town’s grief was used to justify hateful violence without our consent.  

我对纽约市的保护和防御意识日益增强，这座城市对我们这些生活在这里的人意味着什么。至今，我仍对我们城镇的悲痛被用作借口，来在没有我们同意的情况下进行仇恨暴力感到愤怒。

## Everything After  

一切过后

You know the rest. You used to be able to go to greet people at the gate at an airport.  

你知道后面的事情。你以前可以在机场的门口去迎接人。  

They lied about Iraq and killed countless hundreds of thousands of innocents.  

他们在伊拉克撒谎，导致无数无辜者丧生。  

Technological surveillance became the default expectation for everything we do, public or private.  

技术监控已成为我们所有活动的默认期望，无论是公共还是私人。  

They made the cops into an army, all across the country.  

他们把警察变成了一支遍布全国的军队。  

A thousand beautiful potential futures were thrown away.  

一千个美好的未来可能性被遗弃了。  

I wrote to my senator, saying "we could stop driving to work one day a week and never need Saudi oil again, and fight global warming!" (I didn’t call it "climate change" yet.) By the time I got an automated response, we were already at war and the postcard said "we support our troops".  

我给我的参议员写信，提到“我们可以每周有一天不开车上班，这样就不再需要沙特的石油，也能对抗全球变暖！”（那时我还没称之为“气候变化”。）当我收到自动回复时，我们已经在战争中，明信片上写着“我们支持我们的军队”。

In my own technological world, everything changed in a leap, too.  

在我自己的科技世界中，一切都发生了巨大的变化。  

Suddenly everyone knew what Google was, and that some people were sharing news online.  

突然间，大家都知道谷歌是什么，还有一些人在网上分享新闻。  

The strangest part of working in tech was that, as my friends and I launched one of the first big blogging platforms in October of 2001, that same month the original iPod and Windows XP came out., meaning the first very primitive outlines of the online world we all live in now came into view while we were all still in shock and grief and confusion.  

在科技行业工作的最奇怪的部分是，当我和我的朋友们在 2001 年 10 月推出第一个大型博客平台时，同月原版 iPod 和 Windows XP 也相继发布，这意味着我们现在所生活的在线世界的最初轮廓在我们仍然感到震惊、悲伤和困惑的时候逐渐显现出来。

I don’t have any grand conclusion, except that the story you’ve been told about that day is probably bullshit.  

我没有什么重要的结论，除了你听到的关于那一天的故事可能都是谎言。  

None of us ever called the day "9/11", it was always "that Tuesday" or "the attacks" or other things specific to the experience.  

我们从未称这一天为“9/11”，而是称之为“那个星期二”或“袭击”或其他与那次经历相关的说法。  

Afterward, I spent months and even years talking to friends who couldn’t get their heads to forget the sound it made when human bodies hit the ground near them from 90 stories up.  

之后，我花了几个月甚至几年的时间与朋友们交谈，他们始终无法忘记从 90 层高空坠落的人体撞击地面时的声音。  

I remember coworkers who had to report from the site of the attacks every day for weeks, and they came back looking ghostly from both the dust that still settled on their clothes, but also the haunted look in their eyes from facing such unimaginable horror.  

我记得有些同事在袭击现场每天报道几个星期，他们回来时看起来很憔悴，既是因为衣服上仍然沾着灰尘，也因为他们眼中流露出的那种面对难以想象的恐怖的幽怨神情。  

I still think of that burning pile whenever I smell an electrical fire.  

每当我闻到电器着火的味道时，仍然会想起那堆燃烧的东西。

As I write this, I can look out our window and I see the towers of light and I know that the majority of people who are looking at them probably feel little, if anything, about what they represent.  

当我写下这些时，我透过窗户看到光塔，知道大多数看着它们的人可能对它们所代表的意义感到很少，甚至没有任何感觉。  

I’m not mad or resentful that these things have faded; time passes, and we’re fortunate that grief fades with it.  

我并不对这些事情的消逝感到生气或怨恨；时间在流逝，我们很幸运，悲伤也随之减轻。  

But my life changed that day, instantly and forever.  

但我那天的生活瞬间发生了改变，从此再也不一样了。  

I saw the best of what people could be, rising out of the worst that people can do.  

我看到了人们最美好的一面，是在他们最糟糕的行为中崛起的。  

I promised myself I wouldn’t forget that lesson, and that I’d try to live up to having gotten to live through such an experience with such privilege.  

我向自己承诺不会忘记这个教训，并努力活出这样一种经历所带来的特权。  

I still do think about the promise, even if it’s not every day any more.  

我仍然会想起这个承诺，尽管现在不再每天都想了。

If you’ve ever been told a story about 9/11, ask that person how it smelled.  

如果你听过关于 911 的故事，可以问问那个人当时的气味是什么样的。  

Ask them the greatest kindness that they saw. Ask them how they changed.  

问他们见过的最大善行是什么，以及他们是如何改变的。

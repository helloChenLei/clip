“We were promised the curing of cancer and all we got are so-and-so improvements in five-year cancer survival rates” would be a fair thing to say about progress in biomedical sciences in the last few decades.  

“我们被承诺了治愈癌症，但我们所得到的只是在过去几十年里癌症五年生存率方面的一些进展，这样说也许更合适。”  

And cancer is one of the disease areas where we have done pretty well, relatively speaking.  

癌症是我们在相对而言做得相当出色的疾病领域之一。  

If we look at Alzheimer’s, the situation is much worse: up until 2021, we had gone for 20 years  

就阿尔茨海默病而言，情况更糟：直到 2021 年，我们已经度过了 20 年[with no new drugs](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2023-05-03/promising-early-trial-results-new-alzheimers-drug-donanemab#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAfter%2020%20years%20with%20no,the%20end%20of%20Alzheimer's%20disease.) - and even the approved ones have marginal effects[1](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-1-146162283).  

没有新药物 - 即使是已经批准的药物，效果也边缘化。

The big question is: Why?  

核心问题是：为什么？  

A common explanation is that biology might simply be too hard for us to manipulate successfully.  

一个常见的解释是，也许生物学对我们来说太难以成功操纵了。  

Humans have come up with very clever solutions to defeat all these ailments, but despite our ingenuity, we simply cannot match what has been shaped by millions of years of evolution.  

人类已经想出了非常聪明的解决方案来战胜所有这些疾病，但尽管我们很有创造力，我们却无法与亿万年的进化所塑造的东西相匹敌。  

Another explanation is that this is, to use a very online term, simply a “skill issue.” It’s not that biology itself is too hard, we’re just not being smart enough about understanding and manipulating it.  

另一个解释是，简单来说，这只是一个“技能问题”。并不是生物学本身太难，而是我们在理解和运用它方面还不够聪明。

The War on Cancer was declared 50 years ago, with the clear aim of eradicating the disease.  

50 年前宣布了对癌症的战争，旨在消灭这种疾病。  

We have made progress in treating it, but we are nowhere close to eradicating it.  

我们在治疗方面取得了进展，但离根除它还有很长的路要走。

A version of the second theory that I am hearing more and more is that biology suffers from a talent problem.  

越来越多的声音认为，生物学存在人才问题。  

This is what Peter Thiel suggests in one of his  

这是彼得·蒂尔在其中提出的建议[interviews](https://medium.com/@arnoldkling/peter-thiel-and-eric-weinstein-annotated-bd1de574d4bd): that the smartest people go into “harder” sciences, leaving matters as important as whether we will be able to extend human lifespan substantially in the next decades in the hands of subpar people, the ones who could not do math well enough.  

访谈：最聪明的人选择进入“更难”的科学领域，将像我们是否能在未来几十年内大幅延长人类寿命这样重要的问题留在次一流的人手中，那些数学做得不够好的人。  

His interviewer, Eric Weinstein, pushes back a bit against this: after all, molecular biology itself was in large part founded by physicists.  

他的采访者埃里克·温斯坦稍微提出了一些反对意见：毕竟，分子生物学本身在很大程度上是由物理学家创立的。  

But Thiel then appeals to some of his earlier comments about the lack of polymaths in academia and argues that today’s fields are too siloed for a mathematician or physicist to easily transition into biology.  

但是，Thiel 随后又提到了他之前关于学术界缺乏多面手的评论，并认为当今的领域对数学家或物理学家来说过于专业化，不容易转向生物学。

> The more optimistic one is that the culture is just broken.  
> 
> 更乐观的看法是文化只是有些破裂。  
> 
> We've had very talented people go into physics. You go into biology if you're less talented.  
> 
> 我们已经有很多才华横溢的人选择了物理学。如果你的才华稍逊一筹，那就去学生物。  
> 
> You can sort of think of it in Darwinian terms. You can think of biology as a selection for people with bad math genes.  
> 
> 你可以把它类比为达尔文的理论。你可以把生物学视为对数学基因不好的人的选择。  
> 
> You know, if you're good at math, go to math, or physics, or at least chemistry, and biology we sort of selected for all of these people who are somewhat less talented.  
> 
> 你知道，如果你擅长数学，就去学数学，或者物理，至少化学，生物，我们选择了那些在这些领域中略显不足的人。  
> 
> So, that might be a cultural explanation for why it's been been slower progress.  
> 
> 因此，这可能是为什么进展较慢的文化解释。

I disagree with this theory and lean much more towards the “Biology is very complicated” explanation.  

我不同意这个理论，更倾向于“生物学非常复杂”的解释。  

Biologists are less good at math than other scientists, but that’s because there are many areas of biology, and productive areas at that, that do not require that much of it.  

生物学家在数学方面不如其他科学家那么擅长，但这是因为生物学涉及的领域很广泛，而且是非常有成效的领域，不需要太多的数学知识。  

What’s more, when such skills are needed, it is fairly easy for people trained in a more quantitative science, like physics, to transition into biology.  

此外，当需要这些技能时，受过更多量化科学（如物理学）训练的人很容易转向生物学。  

And the interest is there: when my friends from such disciplines want to apply their skills to a more “world of atoms” field, they inevitably lean towards biology.  

朋友们来自不同学科，当他们想将自己的技能应用于更多涉及“原子世界”的领域时，他们不可避免地会倾向于生物学。  

I am not arguing that everything is optimized to perfection.  

我并不是在说一切都被优化得完美无缺。  

There is a case to be made that it should be much easier for a mathematician to become a biologist  

有人认为，数学家转行成为生物学家应该更加容易[2](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-2-146162283).  

It’s also self-evidently true that any intellectual field will benefit from increased intellectual capacity in its workforce.  

显而易见的是，任何知识领域都会因其工作人员智力容量的增加而受益。  

My argument is simply that this is not the main rate-limiting step in biological progress.   

我的观点仅是这不是生物进步中的主要限制因素。

I think the best way to illustrate my points is to look at the history of a specific field, genomics, where there was a lot of will to apply mathematical principles, where this will materialized, and, where top scientists awarded with status and directing large-scale initiatives were mathematically trained.  

我认为最好的方式来阐明我的观点是通过看一个特定领域的历史，比如基因组学，在那里有很多人希望应用数学原理，这种愿望得以实现，并且，那些获得地位并领导大规模倡议的顶尖科学家都接受过数学训练。  

Each and every time, genomics stumbled upon the same problems biologists have struggled with forever: biology is just very messy and hard.  

每一次，基因组学都面临着生物学家们长期以来一直在努力解决的相同问题：生物学只是非常混乱和困难。  

The complexity and unpredictability of biological systems limit the effectiveness of pure intellect and sophisticated predictions.  

生物系统的复杂性和不可预测性限制了纯粹的智力和复杂预测的有效性。  

What's more crucial is our ability to rapidly test and validate our hypotheses through experimentation.  

更关键的是我们能够通过实验迅速测试和验证我们的假设，这一点至关重要。  

Faster feedback loops can be achieved in basic scientific research through improved experimental methods.  

通过改进实验方法，可以在基础科学研究中实现更快的反馈循环。  

In the medical field, accelerating progress will involve streamlining clinical trials both in terms of time and costs.  

在医疗领域，加快进展将涉及简化临床试验，包括时间和成本。

When I take a walk on the outskirts of Cambridge, I sometimes stumble upon “the BRCA2 cycle path”, a road painted in stripes of four colours, according to the genetic sequence of [BRCA2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2) – a gene which, when mutated, causes significantly increased risk of breast cancer.  

当我在剑桥郊外散步时，有时会偶然发现“BRCA2 自行车道”，这是一条路，根据 BRCA2 的遗传序列涂成四种颜色的条纹 - 该基因突变会显著增加患乳腺癌的风险。  

It’s a celebration of the achievements of British scientists and the central role Cambridge in particular has had in the Genomic Revolution.  

这是对英国科学家成就的庆祝，以及剑桥在基因革命中所扮演的核心角色的赞美。  

At the time, in 1994, establishing the identity of BRCA2 as the gene responsible for increased susceptibility to breast cancers, was  

1994 年，确认 BRCA2 基因是导致乳腺癌易感的基因[a monumental feat](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8091231)[3](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-3-146162283).  

一个伟大的成就。  

This work was done before the publication of the Human Genome, so researchers were fishing semi-blindly among billions of letters of unexplored genetic code.  

这项工作是在人类基因组出版之前完成的，因此研究人员在数十亿个未被探索的遗传密码字母中进行了半盲目的探索。  

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F243a53b0-9b3f-4314-99fa-bb9c92c2ce35_856x764.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F243a53b0-9b3f-4314-99fa-bb9c92c2ce35_856x764.png)

The BRCA2 cycle path  

BRCA2 自行车道

Fast forward to 2024 and one can get their entire genome sequenced [for as little as $250.](https://nebula.org/whole-genome-sequencing-dna-test/) This includes the identification of potentially deleterious mutations in BRCA2 and [hundreds of other cancer-predisposition genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70494-0) we have discovered since.  

快进到 2024 年，一个人只需 250 美元就可以对其整个基因组进行测序。这包括鉴定 BRCA2 等潜在有害突变，以及我们自那时以来发现的数百种其他癌症易感基因。  

We have come far in 30 years: from struggling to find the identity of one disease causative gene with relatively rudimentary methods, to regularly reading and interpreting entire genomes made of around 3 billion base pairs  

我们已经走过了 30 年的路程：从用相对简单的方法努力寻找一种疾病致病基因的身份，到定期阅读和解释由大约 30 亿个碱基对组成的整个基因组[4](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-4-146162283) each.  

每个 4 个。

In some ways, I could end the essay here: to regularly read, analyze and store such large amounts of genetic data, it’s obvious we must have integrated quite a lot of mathematical and computing principles in biological workflows.  

从某种角度来看，我可以在这里结束这篇文章：定期阅读、分析和存储如此大量的遗传数据，显然我们必须在生物工作流程中融合了许多数学和计算原理。  

Yet these technical achievements have not been matched by a comparable increase in biological understanding and even less so by a revolution in medicine.  

尽管取得了这些技术成就，但生物学理解的提升并不相应，医学领域更是少有革命性变革。  

Clearly, throwing our technical armamentarium at biology is not enough: there is something intrinsically hard about dealing with the “messy, wet” world of biology, as a tech friend of mine likes to call it.  

很明显，仅仅将我们的技术武器库应用于生物学是不够的：处理生物学中那种“混乱、潮湿”的世界有其固有的难度，就像我的一个技术朋友喜欢说的那样。  

The answer then must be closer to “Biology is complicated” than to “We do not have enough math in biology.” At this point some bioinformaticians might quibble that the computational part of biology is still inefficient for this and that reason.  

生物学是复杂的，而不是我们在生物学中缺乏足够的数学。在这一点上，一些生物信息学家可能会争辩说，生物学的计算部分仍然因为这样或那样的原因而效率低下。  

Sure, that might be the case.  

当然，那可能是这样。  

If diffusion from mathematical to biological sciences would have been perfect, maybe we would have reached our current state of knowledge in 2020 instead of 2024 and so on.  

如果数学向生物科学的渗透是完美无缺的，也许我们早在 2020 年就会达到我们当前的知识水平，而不是等到 2024 年等等。  

But the Revolution still wouldn’t have been here.  

但是革命仍未成功。

Now, someone who believes in the talent hypothesis could still argue that, despite the fact that quantitative scientists have entered biology and applied math to it, the boundaries of their work are ultimately still set by biologists themselves.  

现在，支持人才假设的人仍然可以争辩说，尽管数量科学家已经涉足生物学并将应用数学于其中，但他们的工作边界最终仍由生物学家自己设定。  

So we have not really reaped the rewards from employing these people, since they are relegated to support roles and/or their voices are not as important for the future of the field as those of “classical” biologists.  

因此，我们并没有真正从雇佣这些人中获得回报，因为他们被安排在支持角色，或者他们的声音对于该领域的未来并不像“传统”生物学家那样重要。  

As my examples will later show, math-trained scientists who later made the switch to biology, like  

正如我的例子将会展示的那样，曾经接受数学训练的科学家后来转向生物学领域，就像[Eric Lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lander), [Aviv Regev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviv_Regev), [Richard Durbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Durbin), have been very important voices in the field of biology and some have achieved positions of extreme influence beyond academia.  

Eric Lander、Aviv Regev 和 Richard Durbin 在生物学领域中发挥着非常重要的作用，有些人甚至在学术界之外取得了极大的影响力。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F867d7c0f-e33d-4264-8208-5e35b7e549a9_1586x486.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F867d7c0f-e33d-4264-8208-5e35b7e549a9_1586x486.png)

A 2002 article from Aviv Regev, outlining a vision of treating Biology in a more quantitative manner: “Cells as computation.” Dr. Regev is now Executive Vice President of Genentech Research and Early Development (gRED) and co-leading the Human Cell Atlas.  

2002 年，Aviv Regev 发表了一篇文章，概述了以更加定量的方式处理生物学的愿景：“细胞作为计算”。Regev 博士现任罗氏早期研发和研究的执行副总裁，并共同领导人类细胞图谱项目。  

She also had a very successful academic career.  

她还有一个非常成功的学术生涯。

A layperson transported from the 90s in today’s world would not be that shocked by our medical advancements, in the same way a Geneticist from the same era would be in awe of just how much data we are able to process.  

一个从 90 年代被带到现代世界的普通人对我们的医学进步不会感到太震惊，就像同一时代的遗传学家会对我们能够处理的数据量感到惊叹一样。  

So how did we get here?  

那么我们是怎么到这里的呢？

On June 26, 2000, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium announced that it [completed](https://www.genome.gov/10001457/2000-release-working-draft-of-human-genome-sequence) a draft of the sequence of the human genome — the so-called “genetic blueprint for a human being.” This was, at the time, a tremendous achievement and the culmination of a more than a decade long effort.  

2000 年 6 月 26 日，国际人类基因组测序联盟宣布完成了人类基因组序列的草稿，即所谓的“人类遗传蓝图”。这一时刻被视为一个巨大的成就，也是十多年努力的顶点。  

To mark the importance of the moment, President Bill Clinton held a  

为了纪念这一时刻的重要性，比尔·克林顿总统举行了[ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slRyGLmt3qc) at the White House to announce the achievement, in front of a gathering of ambassadors, scientists, company executives, disease advocates and journalists.  

在白宫举行的仪式上，宣布取得的成就，现场有大使、科学家、公司高管、疾病倡导者和记者参加。  

Hopes for a revolution in medicine were high.  

人们对医学革命的期望很高。

Tremendously useful as the Human Genome might have been[5](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-5-146162283), the revolution did not quite materialize: not 14 years ago, when NBC ran an article with this [headline](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna37663949), and not today.  

人类基因组可能非常有用，但革命并没有完全实现：不是在 14 年前，当 NBC 发表了这样的文章标题时，也不是在今天。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F38af4df1-3c48-4ed9-85bd-f61b246cff68_2000x500.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38af4df1-3c48-4ed9-85bd-f61b246cff68_2000x500.png)

For sure, progress has been made: we are able to prenatally [screen against](https://billiontoone.com/technology/) deadly & debilitating diseases, [particularly if they are monogenic](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/pd.6427)[<sup data-immersive-translate-walked="764a34d2-23fb-4883-8333-e05e52545b7f">6</sup>](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/5d0c8f4b-7a25-4d89-b450-1d5617ea58f0?postPreview=paid&updated=2024-07-05T16%3A45%3A50.028Z&audience=everyone&free_preview=false&freemail=true#footnote-6-146162283). Five-year [cancer survival rates](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/five-year-cancer-survival-in-usa) for many cancers have increased, and genomics has played a part in it.  

确实，已经取得了进展：我们能够在胎儿期筛查致命和致残疾病，尤其是单基因病。许多癌症的五年生存率已经提高，其中基因组学起到了一定作用。  

It’s also a part of so called “  

这也是所谓的“[personalized mRNA cancer vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01717-x)”, which [show promise](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06063-y/figures/1) in diseases like pancreatic cancer, which at the moment suffer from abysmally low survival rates.  

个性化 mRNA 癌症疫苗显示出在疾病如胰腺癌中具有潜力，目前这些疾病的存活率极低。  

Genomically-supported drug targets are  

基因组支持的药物靶点[two times more likely](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3314) to get approval in clinical trials. But to many, this does not quite look like a Revolution.   

两倍更有可能在临床试验中获得批准。但对许多人来说，这并不完全像一场革命。

And, as pointed out before, insufficient integration of mathematics into biology is hardly to blame for this.  

而且，正如之前所指出的，数学与生物学的不充分整合并不应该为此负责。  

If anything, genomics as a field was imbued, from pretty early on, with the desire to digitize biology, to nail it down to a “code”, much like software itself.  

如果说什么的话，基因组学作为一个领域，从很早开始，就充满了将生物数字化的愿望，将其固定在一个“代码”上，就像软件本身一样。  

This is evident from the terminology the field used: “Decoding the Book of Life” said the banner behind President Clinton.  

这一点显而易见，因为该领域使用的术语是：“克林顿总统身后的横幅上写着“解读生命之书”。  

As well as the ethos of those in the field.  

以及那些在该领域工作的人的理念。  

To quote someone mathematically minded that I have much respect for: “  

以数学为导向的某人的引用：“_I like working in genomics because, unlike most of biology, it’s much less messy, much more digital._” It’s also in the name: genomics derives from genetics but added the -omics at the end, a suffix that in biology has come to signify studying large numbers of molecules at the same time: the whole genome, not just one gene at the time, as had been done in classical molecular biology before.  

我喜欢在基因组学领域工作，因为与大多数生物学不同，它要整洁得多，更加数字化。而且，从名字上也能看出来：基因组学源自遗传学，但在末尾加上了“-omics”，这个后缀在生物学中已经代表着同时研究大量分子的意义：整个基因组，而不仅仅是一个基因，就像在经典分子生物学之前所做的那样。  

Where molecular biology is descriptive and reductionist, genomics is code and big data.   

在分子生物学中，描述性和还原主义，而基因组学则是关于代码和大数据的。

This mentality resulted in a rapid integration of methods from computing and mathematics to study genes.  

这种心态导致了计算机和数学方法迅速整合，用于研究基因。  

Even before the publication of the human genome, when experimental methods became advanced enough to generate the necessary data  

甚至在人类基因组出版之前，实验方法已经足够先进，可以生成必要的数据[6](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-6-146162283), mathematically trained bioinformaticians like [Richard Durbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Durbin) [were designing computational tools](http://www.mcb111.org/w06/durbin_book.pdf) to move beyond classical genetics and study genes in a more systematic/computational fashion.[7](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-7-146162283) This type of work only intensified after the publication of the human genome, and was obviously intensely exploited as part of the human genome effort itself.  

6，数学训练有素的生物信息学家如 Richard Durbin 正在设计计算工具，以超越经典遗传学，以更系统化和计算化的方式研究基因。在人类基因组发表后，这种工作只会加剧，并且显然作为人类基因组工作的一部分被强烈利用。  

All this is not to say that there was no friction and ego battles between the data-minded genomicists and the more “classical biologists”, especially those studying proteins  

并不是说，数据导向的基因组学家和更“传统的生物学家”之间没有摩擦和自我斗争，尤其是那些研究蛋白质的人[8](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-8-146162283), who had pretty much reigned supreme over the field of biology for decades.  

8，几乎统治了生物学领域几十年。  

Yet, one must recognize that the most software-like part of biology was afforded great status and resources, with the President himself announcing the completion of the human genome: a kind of official honour that was afforded to few other biological fields.  

然而，必须认识到生物学中最类似软件的部分受到了极高的重视和资源支持，总统本人宣布完成了人类基因组的破译：这种官方荣誉只授予少数其他生物学领域。  

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F34efb513-2edb-4645-b920-505dc4411d68_2046x610.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34efb513-2edb-4645-b920-505dc4411d68_2046x610.png)

Where classical Molecular Biology aimed to study one protein/gene at a time and create diagrams that are intelligible to humans like the one on the left, the ethos of Genomics is one of digitization.  

分子生物学旨在逐个研究蛋白质/基因并创建对人类易于理解的图表，如左侧的图表，而基因组学的理念是数字化的。  

See the genetic code on the Right, made of only 4 letters, which makes up our Genome.  

观察右侧的遗传密码，它仅由 4 个字母组成，构成了我们的基因组。

So what happened?  

发生了什么事情？  

Why didn’t the publication of the human genome, “the code of life”, solve all of biology?  

为什么人类基因组的出版，即“生命密码”，并没有解决所有生物学问题呢？

In some ways, The human genome raised more questions than it answered.  

从某种意义上说，人类基因组提出了比解答更多的问题。  

For example, it showed that humans have  

例如，它显示人类具有[about as many genes](https://www.genome.gov/25520483/online-education-kit-2001-first-draft-of-the-human-genome-sequence-released) as some of the simplest organisms, like worms (C Elegans).  

与一些最简单的生物（如秀丽隐杆线虫）相比，基因数量大致相同。  

Yet we are clearly more complex than worms. How was that possible?  

然而，我们显然比蠕虫更复杂。这是怎么可能的呢？  

Another perplexing finding was that most of the human genome was composed of so-called “junk DNA” — that is, DNA that did not code for any protein.  

另一个令人困惑的发现是，人类基因组中大部分都是由所谓的“垃圾 DNA”组成的 — 也就是说，这些 DNA 并不编码任何蛋白质。  

The central dogma of Biology says that DNA codes for RNA, which in turn codes proteins, the molecules that carry out most of our cell’s functions.  

生物学的中心法则指出 DNA 编码 RNA，而 RNA 再编码蛋白质，这些分子执行大部分细胞功能。  

So what was all the DNA that was not coding for any protein doing there?  

那些没有编码任何蛋白质的 DNA 都在那里做什么呢？

One explanation among many is: epigenetics.  

其中一个解释是：表观遗传学。  

DNA is just part of the story when it comes to how a cell behaves.  

DNA 只是细胞行为的一部分故事。  

One can think about it this way: all cells in a human body share the same DNA, yet some are muscle cells, others are skin cells and so on, each carrying a very specific and differentiated role.  

一个可以这样理解：人体中的所有细胞都拥有相同的 DNA，但有些是肌肉细胞，有些是皮肤细胞等等，每种细胞都承担着独特而特定的功能。  

This is possible due to chemical marks that sit on top of DNA, or the proteins that DNA is wrapped around, and help specify which genes are turned on and off in which type of cell.  

这是可能的，因为存在于 DNA 顶部的化学标记，或者包裹 DNA 的蛋白质，有助于确定在哪种类型的细胞中打开和关闭哪些基因。  

Our ability to map these epigenetic marks lagged behind that of sequencing DNA.  

我们对这些表观遗传标记进行映射的能力落后于 DNA 测序。  

But, in time, researchers developed methods to sequence (or read) these epigenetic marks at scale  

然而，随着时间的推移，研究人员已经开发出了方法，可以大规模测序（或读取）这些表观遗传标记[9](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-9-146162283), in the same way they had done for DNA itself.  

9，就像它们为 DNA 本身所做的那样。

With these methods came the idea behind [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/), a sort of Human Genome Project but for epigenetics, that ended in 2012: what if we could map all the epigenetic marks in different cell types in the same way we had done for the genome?  

随着这些方法的出现，诞生了 ENCODE 的理念，一种类似于人类基因组计划但专注于表观遗传学的项目，该项目于 2012 年结束：如果我们能够像我们为基因组所做的那样，绘制出不同细胞类型中的所有表观遗传标记，会怎样呢？  

A key player in setting up encode was  

成立 encode 的关键参与者之一是[Ewan Birney,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewan_Birney) now head of the European Institute for bioinformatics, and the aforementioned Richard Durbin’s PhD student.  

伊万·伯尼，现任欧洲生物信息学研究所所长，曾是理查德·德宾的博士生。  

ENCODE was again the result of a software-inspired data-driven mindset.  

ENCODE 再次成为软件启发的数据驱动思维的结果。  

And, much like the human genome project itself, it produced a valuable reference dataset for researchers to use.  

就像人类基因组计划本身一样，这产生了一组宝贵的参考数据，供研究人员使用。  

Yet it has not revolutionized biology. Because, again, biology is more complicated than this.  

然而，它并没有彻底改变生物学。因为，再次强调，生物学比这更加复杂。

As a starter, it turns out that we do not even know for sure what most of these epigenetic modifications do — take for example DNA methylation, which I happen to study.  

作为一个新手，事实证明，我们甚至不确定大多数这些表观遗传修饰的作用 — 以 DNA 甲基化为例，这正是我研究的内容。  

The standard wisdom is that DNA methylation represses (or turns off) the expression of genes, something that was inferred mostly via large scale correlative studies  

传统观点认为 DNA 甲基化会抑制（或关闭）基因的表达，这主要是通过大规模相关性研究推断出来的[10](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-10-146162283).  

If DNA methylation was causally repressive, one would expect that artificially inducing DNA methylation would lead to ubiquitous gene repression.  

如果 DNA 甲基化具有因果关系导致基因抑制，那么人们会期望人为诱导 DNA 甲基化会普遍导致基因抑制。  

Yet, when better experimental methods were developed  

然而，当更好的实验方法被开发出来时[to achieve](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02728-5) such a perturbation in cells and test this hypothesis, it turned out that about half of the genes whose promoters were artificially methylated behaved in an unexpected fashion: either not changing expression at all or becoming activated.  

为了实现细胞内的这种扰动并验证这一假设，结果显示，大约一半的基因启动子被人为甲基化后表现出意想不到的方式：要么根本不改变表达，要么被激活。  

As the authors of the article themselves say: “We find that transcriptional responses  

正如文章作者所言：“我们发现转录反应”[11](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-11-146162283) to DNA methylation are highly context-specific.” Again, biology is complicated.  

11 对 DNA 甲基化高度特异。

未甲基化的胞嘧啶与甲基化的胞嘧啶

Many Human Genome Project, ENCODE- like inititatives, focused on sequencing at scale and inspired by the same desire to systematize biology, have existed since then.  

许多类似人类基因组计划、ENCODE 等倡议，专注于大规模测序，并受到同样希望系统化生物学的启发，自那时以来一直存在。  

For example, efforts to catalogue and characterize all mutations in human cancers, like The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Genome Project.  

例如，努力对人类癌症中的所有突变进行编目和表征，就像癌症基因组图谱和癌症基因组项目所做的那样。  

The former was spearheaded by  

前者由...主导[Eric Lander,](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/eric-s-lander) trained as a mathematician, who was also the 11th director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and [Science Advisor to the Presiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advisor_to_the_President)t.  

埃里克·兰德，数学家出身，曾任科学与技术政策办公室第 11 任主任，以及总统科学顾问。  

We have not only managed to map cancer mutations: by applying computational methods from evolutionary biology (and ultimately from mathematics), we are able to pinpoint which ones are causative, and which ones are under neutral selection, distinguishing passengers (which we do not care that much about) from so-called “  

我们不仅成功地绘制了癌症突变图谱：通过应用来自进化生物学（最终来自数学）的计算方法，我们能够准确找出哪些是致病的，哪些是处于中性选择下的，区分乘客（我们不太关心的）和所谓的“[drivers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999502/)”  

驱动程序。

One of the hopes in these efforts is that we would get personalized, genomically targeted therapies for cancer: if someone has mutation X driving their cancer, we would target a therapy to that mutation specifically.  

希望之一是通过这些努力获得针对癌症的个性化、基因组靶向疗法：如果某人的癌症由 X 突变驱动，我们将专门针对该突变进行治疗。  

Yet, in practice, this strategy has been somewhat underwhelming.  

然而，在实际操作中，这种策略表现得有些令人失望。  

We do have some genomically targeted therapies, but they work in a minority of cancers: as of 2020,  

我们确实有一些基因组靶向疗法，但它们只对少数癌症有效：截至 2020 年，[an estimated 7%](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)01121-2/fulltext) of cancer patients were benefiting from genomic medicine at all.  

大约有 7%的癌症患者能够从基因组医学中获益。  

One complication for genomically targeted therapies is that, even if you create a therapy targeted to certain mutation, the tumour has usually already gained the ability to quickly evolve and evade your therapy through the acquisition of other mutations.  

基因组靶向疗法面临的一个复杂问题是，即使你针对某种突变创建了一种疗法，肿瘤通常已经具备了快速进化和通过获得其他突变来逃避你的疗法的能力。  

Where genomics has showed the most success in guiding therapies is actually when it has been combined with novel wet-lab derived techniques (e.g. mRNA technology & delivery methods for this), which have nothing to do with better mathematics.  

遗传组学在指导治疗方面取得最大成功的地方实际上是当它与新颖的湿实验室衍生技术结合时，例如 mRNA 技术和递送方法，这与更好的数学无关。  

An example of such a success are personalized mRNA-based cancer therapies, where the mRNA is tailored to mimic the mutations present in one person’s cancer, and stimulate their immune system to attack their tumour.  

一个成功的例子是个性化的基于 mRNA 的癌症疗法，其中 mRNA 被定制以模仿一个人癌症中的突变，并激活他们的免疫系统攻击肿瘤。  

This approach has

One of the fields where Genomics has shown the most promise is cancer.  

基因组学在许多领域展现出了巨大的潜力，其中癌症是其中之一。

_“We need to remember that while mathematics is the art of the perfect and physics the art of the optimal, biology, because of evolution, is the art of the satisfactory”  

“我们需要记住，数学是追求完美的艺术，物理是追求最优的艺术，而生物学则是因为进化而追求令人满意的艺术”_

(Sydney Brenner, Nobel Prizer Winner)  

悉尼·布伦纳（Sydney Brenner），诺贝尔奖获得者

That biology is complicated is not a reason to think we cannot optimize anything about the way we do science.  

生物学的复杂性并不意味着我们无法优化科学研究的方式。  

And of course, talent is important, although perhaps more relevant than mathematical ability itself are certain personality traits, as I argue in my essay  

当然，才华很重要，尽管也许比数学能力本身更重要的是某些个性特质，正如我在文章中所阐述的[The Weird Nerd comes with trade-offs](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs).  

怪胎带来了一些权衡。  

But, fundamentally, if I had to pick just one factor that I think is holding biology back, I would say “long feedback loops”, as argued in  

但是，从根本上讲，如果我必须选择一个我认为正在阻碍生物学发展的因素，我会说“长反馈循环”，正如所讨论的[this piece](https://an1lam.substack.com/p/slow-feedback-loops-rule-every-living) by Stephen Malina.  

这篇作品是由 Stephen Malina 创作的。  

Baked into this assertion is the premise that we cannot simply “understand” biology from first principles, in the same way we do for physics, and all we can hope for is iterative cycles of experimentation.  

这个断言的基础是，我们不能像对待物理学那样从第一原则上“理解”生物学，我们所能期望的只是不断循环的实验。  

Thus, the faster these cycles, the more surface area we will cover.  

因此，这些循环速度越快，我们将覆盖的表面积就越大。  

In a domain like biology, we should expect diminishing returns from extra intelligence and better predictions, with a much bigger bottleneck being the speed with which we can test these predictions  

在生物学等领域，我们应该预期从额外的智能和更准确的预测中获得递减的回报，更大的瓶颈是我们能够测试这些预测的速度[12](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/why-havent-biologists-cured-cancer#footnote-12-146162283).

One of the reasons innovation in areas like machine learning seems to happen so much faster is that one can iterate and carry little “digital experiments” at a much faster pace than one can do in biology, where one has to wait for results from laborious and slow experiments.  

机器学习等领域创新发生得如此之快的一个原因是，人们可以以比生物学更快的速度迭代和进行一些小的“数字实验”，而在生物学中，人们必须等待费力且缓慢实验的结果。  

Looking at feedback loops in the area of medicine, they are even slower.  

在医学领域观察反馈回路，发现它们的反应速度甚至更慢。  

To figure out if a drug works or not, one has to wait for what is approximately a decade of pre-clinical validation followed by clinical trials.  

要确定一种药物是否有效，需要大约十年的临床前验证，然后进行临床试验。  

Given that 90% of therapies that advance into human trials fail, information from these human trials is particularly important.  

考虑到 90%的进入人体试验阶段的疗法失败，因此来自这些人体试验的信息尤为重要。  

If one  

如果有一个[considers](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-062917-011840#right-ref-B54) the difficulties in realizing the promise of “genetically-targeted” cancer therapies, mentioned in the previous section, a lot of them are about feedback loop speed from ideation to results in humans:  

考虑到实现“基因靶向”癌症治疗的承诺存在困难，前一节提到，其中很多问题涉及从构思到在人类身上得出结果的反馈循环速度

（来自此评论）

Feedback loops in medicine can get even slower than that.  

医学中的反馈循环可能变得更加缓慢。  

If the first therapeutic in a new class fails or causes a severe side-effect, this will chill investors and companies towards that entire class and set the field back years or even decades.  

如果新类别中的第一个治疗方法失败或导致严重副作用，这将使投资者和公司对整个类别产生负面影响，并使该领域倒退数年甚至数十年。  

That’s exactly what happened to the field of gene therapy, a domain scientists and investors were excited about all throughout the 90s.  

这正是基因疗法领域发生的事情，科学家和投资者在整个 90 年代都对此感到兴奋。  

The death of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, a patient treated with an adenovirus therapy, put a halt to progress in the field and  

1999 年，接受腺病毒治疗的患者杰西·盖尔辛格去世，这一事件使该领域的进展受阻[set research back significantly](https://axial.substack.com/p/axial-regenxbio). Investment and general interest in this area declined sharply.  

投资和对这一领域的普遍兴趣急剧下降，严重阻碍了研究进展。  

It would take another 18 years for gene therapy to score its first definitive success, when the FDA  

基因疗法要取得第一个明确成功还需要 18 年时间，那时 FDA[approved Kymriah](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approval-brings-first-gene-therapy-united-states) in 2017 for a form of blood cancer.  

2017 年批准 Kymriah 用于一种血癌类型。

The speed of feedback loops also shapes incentives in a field: as I argue in [another one of my pieces](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/what-does-ramaswamys-roivant-do), it’s plausible that the exceedingly long timelines it takes to develop a drug lead to misaligned incentives within pharma companies, with corresponding decreases in efficiency:  

反馈循环的速度也塑造了某一领域的激励：正如我在另一篇文章中所提到的，开发药物需要花费极长的时间，这可能导致制药公司内部激励不一致，相应效率降低

If feedback loops are so important, what does the future of the field look like?  

反馈循环如此重要，那么该领域的未来会是怎样的呢？  

Overall, I am bullish on biology and more bearish on medicine.  

总的来说，我对生物学持乐观态度，对医学持悲观态度。  

The reason is simple: we are getting better and better at doing large-scale, so-called multiplexed  

原因很简单：我们在进行大规模、所谓的多路复用方面变得越来越娴熟[experiments](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4k0EcsIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=4k0EcsIAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC), where many outcomes are measured in the same experiment. Some [believe](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-road-to-biology-2-0-will-pass-through-black-box-data-bbd00fabf959?gi=8bb4bd55e129) that the future of biology lies entirely in iterations of these large scale experiments, followed by feeding the results into AI models and refining predictions.  

有些人认为生物学的未来完全取决于这些大规模实验的迭代，随后将结果输入 AI 模型并改进预测。  

This is what an increasing number of biologists across academia and the private sector are attempting to do.  

越来越多的学术界和私营部门的生物学家正试图做的事情。  

For example,  

举例来说，[Dyno Therapeutics](https://www.dynotx.com/) is a start-up that has developed a platform to carry out [massive multiplexed experiments](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaw2900) to improve the tissue-specificity and efficacy of gene therapies.  

Dyno Therapeutics 是一家初创公司，他们开发了一种平台，可以进行大规模多重实验，以提高基因治疗的组织特异性和疗效。  

The results from these experiments are fed to ML algorithms that recommends better proteins to try out in the next cycle, in an iterative fashion.  

这些实验的结果被馈送到机器学习算法中，推荐在下一个周期中尝试更好的蛋白质，以迭代的方式。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F26aa3b54-1c46-4266-9ae8-145c15db2cbc_1850x682.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26aa3b54-1c46-4266-9ae8-145c15db2cbc_1850x682.png)

The reason why I am (somewhat) bearish on medicine is that there are signs feedback loops are getting slower and also fewer in number.  

我对医学持（有点）悲观的原因是，迹象显示反馈环路变得越来越缓慢，而且数量也越来越少。  

Clinical trials, the main avenue through which we can get results on whether drugs work in humans,  

临床试验是我们了解药物在人体中是否有效的主要途径，[are getting more expensive](https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/03/why-were-not-prepared-for-next-wave-of-biotech-innovation/).  

物价正在上涨。  

The culprits are so numerous and so scattered across the medical world, that it’s hard to nominate just one: everything from  

罪魁祸首如此之多，遍布医学界，以至于很难只指认一个：一切都源自[HIPAA rules](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/privacy-versus-progress-in-medicine) to [Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)](https://www.cspicenter.com/p/its-time-to-review-the-institutional) contribute to making the clinical trial machine a long and arduous slog.  

HIPAA 规定对机构审查委员会（IRBs）的规定有助于使临床试验变得漫长而艰难。  

An increase in clinical trial costs will mean that for the same amount of money, there will simply be less of them and consequently, less feedback.  

临床试验成本的增加意味着，用同样的资金，将会有更少的试验，因此反馈也会减少。  

There are some reasons for optimism too.  

也有一些令人乐观的原因。  

The COVID pandemic showed us that some high-quality trials are  

新冠疫情向我们展示了一些高质量的试验，这些试验_much_ cheaper than others - the RECOVERY clinical trial in the UK that discovered steroids cut COVID-19 deaths by ⅓ was [much cheaper than traditional trials](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=email).  

比其他试验便宜得多 - 在英国进行的 RECOVERY 临床试验发现，类固醇将新冠肺炎死亡率降低了三分之一，比传统试验成本更低。  

A challenge for policymakers will be learning from this experience and implementing RECOVERY-like strategies across a larger number of clinical trials.  

政策制定者面临的挑战之一是从这一经验中汲取教训，并在更多的临床试验中实施类似 RECOVERY 的策略。

One could also argue that, even if clinical trials are getting more expensive, we can always just invest more in drug development.  

有人可能会认为，即使临床试验变得更昂贵，我们总是可以在药物开发上增加投资。  

After all, it’s such an important area.  

毕竟，这是一个如此重要的领域。  

Unfortunately, all signs point towards the opposite being true in the near future.  

不幸的是，所有的迹象都表明在不久的将来情况将恰恰相反。  

The current political trend is that of regulating down drug prices, via bills like the  

当前的政治趋势是通过类似法案的方式来降低药品价格[Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/faqs-about-the-inflation-reduction-acts-medicare-drug-price-negotiation-program/). In a recent [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32606/w32606.pdf), economists [Ariel Pakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari%C3%A9l_Pakes) & Kate Ho attempt to estimate the impact of such policies and conclude:   

通货膨胀减缓法案。在最近的一篇论文中，经济学家 Ariel Pakes 和 Kate Ho 试图估计这些政策的影响，并得出结论：

> Our calculations indicate that currently proposed U.S. policies to reduce pharmaceutical prices, though particularly beneficial for low-income and elderly populations, could dramatically reduce firms’ investment in highly welfare-improving R&D.  
> 
> 我们的计算表明，目前提议的美国政策旨在降低药品价格，虽然对低收入和老年人口群体特别有益，但可能会大幅减少公司对高福利改善研发的投资。  
> 
> The U.S. subsidizes the worldwide pharmaceutical market.  
> 
> 美国在全球制药市场上提供补贴。  
> 
> One reason is U.S. prices are higher than elsewhere.  
> 
> 一个原因是美国的价格比其他地方高。

This means that, if US lowers spending on drugs and other countries do not pick up the tab, we will have less investment in drug development.  

这意味着，如果美国减少药品支出，而其他国家不承担这部分费用，我们在药品研发方面的投资就会减少。  

If this does happen, the only hope is for us to get so good at biology that the therapeutic candidates we will be advancing into clinical trials will succeed at much higher rates than they do at the moment, making up for the decrease in the number of such trials.  

如果真的发生这种情况，我们唯一的希望就是在生物学方面取得如此大的进步，使我们推进进入临床试验的治疗候选药物成功率远高于目前水平，从而弥补这类试验数量的减少。  

Basically, we would rely entirely on positive spillovers from better biology.   

基本上，我们将完全依赖于更好的生物学带来的积极溢出效应。

The trends in terms of medical feedback loops do not look good.  

医疗反馈循环的趋势不容乐观。  

If these trends hold true in the near future, we should expect more and more expensive trials with  

如果这些趋势在不久的将来持续下去，我们应该预计审判会变得越来越昂贵[less and less money](https://rapport.bio/all-stories/fix-the-ira-letter) going into clinical trials, as well as in pharmaceutical R&D more broadly.  

越来越少的资金投入临床试验，以及在制药研发领域的广泛情况。  

An interesting observation is that the speeding up of feedback loops in pre-clinical biology has mostly been an emergent, undirected process, born out of the efforts of thousands of scientists across academia and private industry.  

有趣的观察是，临床前生物学中反馈循环加快的过程大多是一个出现的、无指导的过程，是成千上万名科学家在学术界和私营行业的努力的结果。  

On the other hand, the slowing of feedback loops in medicine will have largely been the result of policy decisions.  

另一方面，医学中反馈循环的减缓在很大程度上是政策决策的结果。  

It might be that science is the field that’s actually working best at the moment!  

或许科学是目前运作最佳的领域！

肯特·纳伯恩的《简单的真理：生活中重大问题的明晰而温和指引》

\*\*\*

“Education is one of the great joys and solaces of life.  

教育是生活中的一大乐事和慰藉。  

It gives us a framework for understanding the world around us and a way to reach across time and space to touch the thoughts and feelings of others.  

它为我们提供了理解周围世界的框架，让我们能够跨越时间和空间，触及他人的思想和感情。  

But education is more than schooling.  

但教育远不止于上学。  

It is a cast of mind, a willingness to see the world with an endless sense of curiosity and wonder.  

这是一种心境，一种愿意以无尽的好奇心和惊叹来看待世界的态度。  

If you want to be truly educated, you must adopt this cast of mind.  

要想真正受到教育，就必须拥有这种思维方式。  

You must open yourself to the richness of your everyday experience — to your own emotions, to the movements of the heavens and the languages of birds, to the privations and successes of people in other lands and other times, to the artistry in the hands of the mechanic and the typist and the child.”  

你必须打开心扉，体验日常生活的丰富多彩——感受自己的情感，感受天空的变化和鸟语，感受其他国家和其他时代人们的困苦和成功，感受机械师、打字员和孩子手中的艺术。

“Confucius, who told his followers, ‘Study without thinking and you are blind; think without studying and you are in danger.’”  

孔子告诉他的追随者：“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆。”

“School, if it is good, imparts knowledge and a context for understanding the world around us.  

学校，如果是优质的，不仅传授知识，还为我们理解周围世界提供了背景。  

It opens us to ideas that we could never discover on our own, and makes us one with the life of the mind as it has been shaped by people and cultures that we could never meet in our own experience.  

它让我们接触到那些我们自己无法发现的想法，让我们与那些我们在现实生活中无法遇见的人和文化所塑造的思维生活融为一体。  

It makes us part of a community of learners, and helps us give form and direction to the endless flow of experience that passes before us.”  

它让我们融入学习者社区，帮助我们给经验的无尽流动赋予形式和方向。

“…along with knowledge, you must seek wisdom. Knowledge is multiple; wisdom is singular.  

...与知识并存，你必须追求智慧。知识是多元的；智慧是独一无二的。  

Knowledge is words; wisdom is silent.  

知识在于言语，智慧则体现在沉默中。  

Knowledge is standing outside, understanding what is seen; wisdom is standing at the center, knowing what is not seen.  

知识是站在外部，理解所见之物；智慧是站在中心，洞悉看不见的事物。  

No person can be whole without both dimensions of learning.”  

没有两个学习维度，就没有人能够完整。

“The true measure of your education is not what you know, but how you share what you know with others.”  

你的教育真正的衡量标准不在于你知道什么，而在于你如何与他人分享你所知道的。

“Choose your work carefully.  

仔细选择你的工作。  

No matter how much you might believe that your work is nothing more than what you do to make money, your work makes you who you are, because it is where you put your time.  

无论你可能认为，你的工作只是为了赚钱，实际上，你的工作塑造了你的个性，因为那是你花时间的地方。  

We are what we do, and the more we do it, the more we become it.  

我们是我们所做之事，而我们做得越多，我们就变得越多。  

By giving a job your time, you are giving it your consciousness.  

通过将时间投入工作，您也在将自己的意识投入其中。  

Eventually it will fill your life with the reality that it presents.”  

最终，它会让你的生活充满它所展现的现实。

“The way they deal with money is a result of how they think about money, not of how much money they have.”  

他们对金钱的处理方式取决于他们对金钱的看法，而不是取决于他们拥有多少金钱。

“Money on its most basic level is a hard fact — either you have it or you don’t.  

在最基本的层面上，金钱是一个硬性事实 — 要么你有，要么你没有。  

But on its emotional and psychological level it is purely a fiction.  

但从情感和心理层面来看，这纯粹是虚构的。  

It becomes what you let it become.”  

它会变成你愿意让它变成的样子。

“He may be a millionaire, but if his fantasies run into the billions, in his own mind he is poor.  

他可能是个百万富翁，但如果他的幻想达到了十亿级别，在他自己的想法中，他却感到贫穷。  

Another person, who sees money as a simple tool for moving through life, will feel comfortable if she has a dollar more than she needs in her pocket, and positively rich if she has ten dollars more than she needs.  

另一个人将金钱视为简单的生活工具，如果口袋里多出一美元，会感到舒适；如果比所需多出十美元，会感到非常富有。  

She has not built her happiness around desires, so she does not have to measure her money against those desires.  

她没有以欲望为中心建立自己的幸福，因此不必拿金钱来衡量这些欲望。  

She simply has an extra dollar she can spend any way she wants.  

她只是有一块钱可以随心所欲地花。  

The difference between these two people does not lie in their actual wealth.  

这两个人的不同之处并不在于他们的财富多少。  

It lies in their psychological relationship to money.  

它指的是他们与金钱的心理关系。  

They may have exactly the same amount of money — but one measures money against desires and the other measures it against needs.”  

他们可能拥有同样多的钱 — 但一个人用金钱衡量欲望，另一个用金钱衡量需求。

“People who measure their money against their desires will never be happy, because there will always be another desire waiting to lure them.  

“那些总是拿金钱与欲望相比较的人永远不会感到幸福，因为总会有新的欲望诱惑着他们。”  

People who measure their money against their needs can gain control over their lives by gaining control over their needs.”  

那些能够根据自己的需求来衡量金钱的人，可以通过控制自己的需求来掌控自己的生活。

“When you don’t have enough to survive, money becomes the centerpiece of your life because you are obsessed with its absence, and your heart very quickly fills with desperation and anger.”  

当你无法维持生计时，金钱就成为你生活的核心，因为你对它的缺乏感到痴迷，你的心很快就充满了绝望和愤怒。

“The world is full of desperate people. Even people who want to help can give only so much.  

世界充满了绝望的人。即使是想要帮助的人，也只能尽力而为。  

They will not respond to more than they see. If they see a hungry man, they will try to feed him.  

他们只会对他们所见到的事物做出反应。如果他们看到一个饥饿的人，他们会尝试给他食物。  

If they see an angry man, they will try to avoid him.  

如果他们看到一个生气的男人，他们会尽量避开他。  

If they see a promising man, they will try to help him fulfill his promise.  

如果他们看到一个有前途的男士，他们会努力帮助他实现他的承诺。  

Show your promise, not your anger and desperation, and the hand of poverty will more readily release its grip on your life.”  

展现你的承诺，而非愤怒和绝望，贫困之手将更乐意释放对你生活的控制。

“It is as important to know how to be poor as it is to know how to be rich.”  

知道如何贫穷与知道如何富有同样重要。

“Financial well-being is nothing more than a balancing act on the back of circumstance.  

财务幸福不过是在环境的背景下进行的一种平衡行为。  

You can be thrown off at any time.  

你随时可能被抛弃。  

If you know how to be poor with dignity and grace, nothing short of massive financial disaster can disturb your peace of mind.  

如果你懂得如何以尊严和优雅的方式面对贫困，除了巨大的财务灾难，什么也不能动摇你的内心平静。  

Knowing how to be poor means developing an unerring instinct for the difference between what is essential and what is only desirable.  

知道如何贫穷意味着培养出对什么是必需的和什么只是可取之间的敏锐直觉。  

It means knowing how to take control of your life — how to repair and maintain the things around you, how to purchase wisely and well, how not to purchase at all when you do not have the means to do so, and how to take joy in the simple pleasures in life.  

这意味着懂得如何掌控自己的生活 — 如何维修和保养周围的事物，如何明智地购买，当无法购买时则不购买，以及如何从生活中的简单乐趣中获得快乐。  

It means not getting caught up in what is lacking, but finding meaning in what you have.”  

它的意思是不要陷入缺少的东西中，而是要在你已经拥有的东西中找到意义。

“Debt, not poverty, is the greatest enemy of financial well-being and peace of mind.”  

债务，而非贫困，是财务幸福和心灵平静的最大敌人。

“…debt defines your future, and when your future is defined, hope begins to die.  

“……债务决定了你的未来，当未来被决定时，希望开始消失。  

You have committed your life to making money to pay for your past. Stay away from debt if you can.  

你已经把你的生活奉献给赚钱来弥补过去。如果可以的话，尽量避免债务。  

There is no sadder sight than the person with dreams and promise whose eyes have dulled and whose days are spent pushing the heavy wheel of debt toward an endless horizon.”  

“没有比那些满怀梦想和希望的人，眼神黯淡，日复一日推着沉重的债务之轮向无尽的地平线前进，更令人心痛的景象。”

“Money tends to move away from those who try to hoard it, and toward those who share it.”  

金钱倾向于远离那些试图囤积它的人，而向那些愿意分享的人靠拢。

“Unaware of his prices, I went over to see him. I told him how much I had. I was five dollars short.  

不知道他的价格，我过去找他了。我告诉他我带了多少钱。结果少了五美元。  

‘My price is my price,’ he said, and slammed the door.  

“我的价格就是我的价格，”他说着，然后砰地关上了门。  

Now, when I drive by his house, I see his yard crammed with doghouses. His house is falling down.  

现在，每当我开车经过他的房子时，我都会看到他的院子里挤满了狗窝。他的房子正在倒塌。  

His life is mired in poverty. But he will not change his price.  

他的生活困顿在贫困之中。但他不会改变他的态度。  

He has established a value in his own mind and no one shares that value.  

他在心中确立了一种价值观，而这种价值观却无人能分享。  

His life cannot go forward until he frees himself from his conviction that he cannot take a loss.  

他的生活无法继续下去，直到他从认为自己无法承受损失的信念中解脱出来。  

He will die surrounded by his doghouses, and they will be sold for five dollars apiece at a yard sale.  

他将在自己的狗窝周围离世，然后这些狗窝会以每只五美元的价格在庭售中售出。  

Learn from the old man. He is fixated on the doghouses, not on what they will enable him to do.”  

向老人学习。他专注于狗屋本身，而非它们将带来的益处。

“We must always remember that possessions have no inherent value. They become what we make them.  

我们必须永远记住，财产并没有固有的价值。它们变成了我们赋予它们的意义。  

If they increase our capacity to give, they become something good.  

如果他们增加我们的施与能力，那就是一件好事。  

If they increase our focus on ourselves and become standards by which we measure other people, they become something bad.”  

如果他们让我们过分关注自己，并成为我们衡量他人的标准，那它们就会变成一种不好的东西。

“And when the objects accumulate, do what you must to free yourself from their false importance.  

当物品堆积时，做你必须做的事情，摆脱它们的虚假重要性。  

Give away what you don’t use. Go on a long trip and travel lightly.  

放弃你不再使用的物品。踏上一场长途旅行，带着轻松的心情。  

Find a possession you value highly and give it to someone who would value it more.  

找到你珍视的物品，送给一个更懂得珍惜它的人。  

Do something to remind yourself that most of your possessions are nothing more than unimportant decorations on who you really are.”  

“提醒自己，你的大部分财物只是你真正身份的无关紧要的装饰品。”

“Listen to the quiet wisdom that says you will value your possessions more if you have fewer of them, and that you will find deeper meaning in human sharing than in the accumulation of goods.”  

“倾听那份安静的智慧，它告诉你，拥有更少的财产会让你更珍惜它们，而在人与人之间的分享中，你会发现比物质积累更深刻的意义。”

“…true giving is not an economic exchange; it is a generative act.  

“……真正的给予并非经济交易；而是一种创造性的行为。  

It does not subtract from what we have; it multiplies the effect we can have in the world.”  

它不是减去我们已有的，而是增加我们在世界上的影响力。

“Many people don’t want to be travelers.  

许多人不喜欢当旅行者。  

They would rather be tourists, flitting over the surface of other people’s lives while never really leaving their own.  

他们更愿意成为游客，只在别人生活的表面上掠过，却从未真正离开自己的生活。  

They try to bring their world with them wherever they go, or try to recreate the world they left.  

他们试图无论走到哪里都带着自己的世界，或者试图重新创造他们离开的那个世界。  

They do not want to risk the security of their own understanding and see how small and limited their experiences really are.  

他们不愿冒自己理解的安全风险，意识到他们的经历实际上是多么微不足道和有限。  

To be a real traveler, you must be willing to give yourself over to the moment and take yourself out of the center of your universe.  

要成为一个真正的旅行者，你必须愿意将自己交给当下，并让自己走出自己的中心。  

You must believe totally in the lives of the people and the places where you find yourself.”  

你必须完全相信人们的生活和你所在的地方。

“We will die with work undone. The labors of life are endless.  

我们将死在工作未完成之中。生活的劳动是无穷无尽的。  

Better that you should accept the rhythms of life and know that there are times when you need to stop to draw a breath, no matter how great the labors are before you.”  

更好的是，你应该接受生活的节奏，并明白有时候你需要停下来喘口气，无论你面前的劳动有多么艰巨。

“Solitude is a condition of peace that stands in direct opposition to loneliness.  

孤独是一种与孤独直接对立的和平状态。  

Loneliness is like sitting in an empty room and being aware of the space around you.  

孤独就像坐在一个空房间里，感受到周围的虚空。  

It is a condition of separateness. Solitude is becoming one with the space around you.  

孤独是与周围空间融为一体的状态。  

It is a condition of union.”  

这是一个联盟的前提条件。

“How you deal with love is how love will deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are very different.”  

你对待爱情的方式决定了爱情对待你的方式，我们所有人的心都感受到同样的痛苦和喜悦，即使我们的生活和方式各不相同。

“The central secret seems to be choosing well.  

“核心的秘密似乎在于做出明智的选择。  

There is something to the claim of fundamental compatibility.  

有一些基本兼容性的主张，这个主张是有道理的。  

Good people can create a bad relationship, even though they both dearly want the relationship to succeed.  

善良的人也可能会建立一段糟糕的关系，尽管他们都真心希望这段关系能成功。  

It is important to find someone with whom you can create a good relationship from the outset.”  

“重要的是找到一个可以从一开始就建立良好关系的人。”

“Unfortunately, it is hard to see clearly in the early stages of a relationship.  

“很遗憾，在一段关系的早期阶段很难看清楚。”  

Sexual attraction blinds you to the thousands of little things by which relationships eventually survive or fail.  

性吸引力会让你忽视关系最终存亡的无数细微之处。  

You need to find a way to see beyond this initial overwhelming physical fascination.”  

你需要找到一种方法，超越这种最初的压倒性的身体吸引力，去看到更深层的东西。

“Laughter is one clue to compatibility.  

“笑声是兼容性的一个线索。  

It tells you how much you will enjoy each other’s company over the long term.  

它告诉你彼此在长期相处时会有多愉快。  

If your laughter together is good and healthy, and not at the expense of others, then you have a healthy relationship to the world.”  

如果你们的笑声是愉快且健康的，而且不是以伤害他人为代价的，那么你们与世界的关系就是健康的。

“Laughter is the child of surprise.  

笑声源自于惊喜。  

If you can make each other laugh, you can always surprise each other.  

如果你们能互相逗笑，就能不断给彼此带来惊喜。  

If you can always surprise each other, you can always keep the world around you new.”  

如果你们能不断给彼此带来惊喜，就能让周围的世界始终充满新鲜感。

“Beware of a relationship in which there is no laughter.  

“当心那些没有笑声的关系。  

Even the most intimate relationships, if based only on seriousness, have a tendency to turn dour.”  

即使是最亲密的关系，如果只是建立在严肃之上，往往会变得沉闷。

“We each have a different kind of strength. Some of us are able to persevere against hopeless odds.  

每个人都有自己独特的力量。有些人能够在绝望的情况下坚持不懈。  

Some are able to see light in a world of darkness.  

有些人能够在黑暗的世界中看到光明。  

Some are able to give selflessly with no thought of return, while others are able to bring a sense of importance into the hearts of those around them.  

有些人能够无私地给予，没有任何回报的想法，而另一些人能够让周围的人感到重要。  

But no matter how we exhibit strength, its truest measure is the calm and certain conviction with which it causes us to act.  

但无论我们展现出多大的力量，其真正的衡量标准在于它让我们行动的平静和坚定信念。  

It is the ability to discern the path with heart, and follow it even when at the moment we might wish to be doing something else.”  

它是辨识内心之路的能力，即使此刻我们可能希望做其他事情，也要坚定地跟随它。

“True strength is not about force, but about conviction.  

真正的力量不在于强大，而在于信念。  

It lives at the center of belief where fear and uncertainty cannot gain a foothold.”  

它存在于信仰的核心，恐惧和不确定性无法扎根。

“…strength based in force is a strength people fear.  

“…基于力量的力量是人们所畏惧的力量。  

Strength based in love is a strength people crave.”  

“以爱为基础的力量是人们渴望拥有的力量。”

“Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu spoke about when he said, ‘A frog in a well cannot be talked to about the sea.’”  

“中国哲学家庄子曾说过，‘井底之蛙不可能理解大海。’”

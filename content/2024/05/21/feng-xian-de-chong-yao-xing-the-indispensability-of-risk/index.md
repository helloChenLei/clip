Oftentimes, we’re best able to understand something we’re interested in through analogies that clarify the matter by establishing connections between it and other parts of life.  

通常，我们最能够通过类比来理解我们感兴趣的事物，通过与生活的其他方面建立联系来澄清问题。  

 That’s why I’ve written a memo comparing investing to sports in each of the four decades I’ve been writing memos and one connecting investing and card playing in 2020.  

这就是为什么我写了一份备忘录，比较了我在过去四个十年中写备忘录时投资与体育之间的关系，以及 2020 年投资与打牌之间的联系。  

 

The motivation for this memo comes from an article in _The Wall Street Journal_ of April 12 that my partner Bruce Karsh sent me entitled “Chess Teaches the Power of Sacrifice” by Maurice Ashley, a chess grandmaster who has been inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame.  

这份备忘录的动机源自我合作伙伴布鲁斯·卡什（Bruce Karsh）发给我的一篇文章，标题为《国际华尔街日报》4 月 12 日刊登的“国际象棋教会我们牺牲的力量”，作者是莫里斯·阿什利（Maurice Ashley），一位被引入美国国际象棋名人堂的国际象棋特级大师。  

 Few people know that Bruce is a chess player, and I hadn’t thought about this fact for years, but the article provided a good reminder and moved me to dash off this memo.  

很少人知道布鲁斯是国际象棋选手，这个事实多年来我都没有想到过，但这篇文章提醒了我，并促使我写下这份备忘录。  

 

As is obvious from the article’s title, the piece is mostly about the role of sacrifice.  

文章主要讨论牺牲的重要性，正如标题所示。  

 Ashley says, “Many positions cannot be won or saved without something of value being given away, from a lowly pawn all the way up to the mighty queen.” Intentionally losing a piece as part of one’s gameplan is the sacrifice that Ashley is referencing.  

Ashley 说：“许多局面在没有牺牲一些有价值的东西的情况下是无法赢得或保住的，从卑微的兵到强大的皇后。” 故意失去一枚棋子作为个人游戏计划的一部分就是 Ashley 所指的牺牲。

-   He describes some sacrifices as “shams,” (a term coined by chess master Rudolf Spielmann in his book _The Art of Sacrifice in Chess_) where “. . .  
    
    他将一些牺牲描述为“骗局”，（这个术语是由国际象棋大师鲁道夫·斯皮尔曼在他的著作《国际象棋牺牲艺术》中创造的），其中“...  
    
    one can easily see that the piece being given up will return concrete benefits that can be clearly calculated.”  
    
    一个人可以很容易地看出，放弃的那部分将带来可以清晰计算的具体好处。
    
-   Others are deemed “real” sacrifices, where “. . .  
    
    其他人被视为“真正”的牺牲，其中“...  
    
    giving away a piece offers gains that are neither immediate nor tangible.  
    
    分享一份礼物，带来的回报既非即时又无形。  
    
    The return on investment might be controlling more space, creating an assailable weakness in the opponent’s position, or having more pieces in the critical sector of attack.”  
    
    投资回报可能表现为控制更多空间，制造对手阵地易攻破的弱点，或者在攻击的关键领域拥有更多棋子。
    

The analogy to investing begins to become clear.  

投资的类比开始变得明显。  

 Buying a 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a modest or “sham” sacrifice.  

购买一张 10 年期美国国债只是一种适度或“虚假”的牺牲。  

 You give up the use of your money for ten years, but that’s only an opportunity cost, and accepting it brings the certainty of interest income.  

你放弃了十年使用金钱的权利，但这只是一个机会成本，接受它会带来利息收入的确定性。  

 Most other investments involve real sacrifices, though, where the risk of loss is borne in pursuit of “gains that are neither immediate nor tangible.”  

大多数其他投资都需要做出真正的牺牲，承担损失的风险，以追求“既非即时又非切实可及”的收益。

Ashley goes on to speak of sacrifice in risk/return terms that are familiar to investors.  

Ashley 继续谈到牺牲，用投资者熟悉的风险/回报术语来描述。  

 He describes his mother’s decision to leave him (at age two) and his two siblings in Jamaica and travel to the U.S. in search of a better life for herself and for them.  

他描述了他母亲在他两岁时做出的决定，留下他和他的两个兄弟在牙买加，前往美国为自己和他们寻求更好的生活。  

 She reached her goal a decade later and was able to bring her kids to the U.S., where they would find success in a variety of fields:  

十年后，她终于实现了目标，成功将孩子们带到美国，在那里他们将在各个领域取得成功。

**It did not have to turn out that way.** It did because she was willing to stomach the key aspect of making real sacrifices: **the willingness to take risks****.** For a chess player, risk is as much intuited as it is calculated.  

事情不一定要发展成那样，但因为她愿意承受做出真正牺牲的关键，也就是愿意冒险，所以事情最终变成了那个样子。对于国际象棋选手来说，风险既是直觉又是经过计算的。  

 Due to the inherent complexity of the game, it is virtually impossible to assess with certainty whether a risky move will pay off in the end. **It’s up to the player to decide if sufficient conditions have been met to take the chance on a risky move****. . . .**  

由于游戏的固有复杂性，几乎不可能确定一个冒险的举动最终是否会成功。玩家需要自行判断是否已经满足了足够的条件来冒险尝试这个冒险的举动。. . .

What we do know, however, is that the famous saying “No risk, no reward” is true in many cases.  

然而，我们确实知道的是，在许多情况下，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”这句著名的谚语是正确的。  

 A skilled adversary is normally able to handle solid, conservative play and therefore able to rob us of opportunities that may be inherent in our position.  

一个技艺高超的对手通常能够应对稳健的比赛，从而剥夺我们在局势中可能存在的机会。  

 As \[five-time world chess champion\] Magnus Carlsen put it, “Not being willing to take risks is an extremely risky strategy.” (Emphasis added)  

正如\[五届世界国际象棋冠军\]马格努斯·卡尔森所说，“不愿意冒险是一种极其危险的策略。”（强调添加）

**And there you have it: the indispensability of risk.  

这就是：风险的重要性所在。**

The Risk of Not Taking Risk  

不冒风险就是冒风险

Because the future is inherently uncertain, we usually have to choose between (a) avoiding risk and having little or no return, (b) taking a modest risk and settling for a commensurately modest return, or (c) taking on a high degree of uncertainty in pursuit of substantial gain but accepting the possibility of substantial permanent loss.  

由于未来本质上是不确定的，我们通常需要在（a）避免风险且几乎没有回报、（b）承担适度风险并接受相应适度的回报，或者（c）承担高度不确定性以追求巨大收益，但也要接受可能造成重大永久损失的可能性之间做出选择。  

 Everyone would love a shot at earning big gains with little risk, but the “efficiency” of the market – meaning the fact that the other participants in the market aren’t dummies – usually precludes this possibility.  

每个人都希望有机会以很小的风险获得巨大的收益，但通常市场的“高效性”排除了这种可能性，因为这意味着市场中的其他参与者并非傻瓜。

Most investors are capable of accomplishing “a” and most of “b.” The challenge in investing lies in the pursuit of some version of “c.” **Earning high returns – in absolute terms or relative to other investors in a market – requires that you bear meaningful risk – either the possibility of loss in the pursuit of absolute gain or the possibility of underperformance in the pursuit of outperformance.  

大多数投资者都有能力完成“a”和大部分“b”。投资的挑战在于追求某种形式的“c”。获得高回报，无论是绝对回报还是相对于市场上其他投资者的回报，都要求您承担有意义的风险，可能是在追求绝对收益时承担损失的可能性，也可能是在追求超额表现时承担表现不佳的可能性。  

 In each case, the two are inseparable.   

在每种情况下，这两者是密不可分的。**As Ashley says, no risk, no reward. No pain, no gain.  

像艾什莉所说的那样，没有风险就没有收获。不劳则无获。

The risk inherent in not taking enough risk is very real.  

不承担足够的风险本身就存在着很大的风险。  

 Individual investors who eschew risk may end up with a return that is insufficient to support their cost of living.  

避免风险的个人投资者可能最终获得的回报不足以维持他们的生活成本。  

 And professional investors who take too little risk may fail to keep up with their clients’ expectations or their benchmarks.  

投资过于保守的专业投资者可能无法满足客户的期望或跟上基准。

Like chess (and most card games), backgammon requires the calculation of when to take risk and when to avoid it.  

像国际象棋（以及大多数纸牌游戏）一样，双陆棋需要计算何时冒险以及何时避免风险。  

 In backgammon, two players move their checkers around the board based on throws of a pair of dice.  

在西洋双陆棋中，两名玩家根据掷骰子的结果在棋盘上移动他们的棋子。  

 One player moves clockwise and the other counterclockwise.  

一名玩家顺时针移动，另一名玩家逆时针移动。  

 When players’ checkers come near each other, the player who’s moving often has a choice between (a) landing on one of the other player’s checkers, sending it back to the start (but at the risk of leaving the moving checker in a vulnerable position), and (b) avoiding doing so to play it safe.  

当玩家的跳子彼此靠近时，移动的玩家通常会面临选择：（a）落在另一位玩家的跳子上，将其送回起点（但这样做可能会使移动的跳子处于脆弱位置），或者（b）选择避免这样做以保险起见。  

 No one wants to be exposed and get hit.  

没有人愿意被揭露并受到打击。  

 But most beginners play it too safe, and because they put so much emphasis on avoiding getting hit, they rarely win.  

但是大多数初学者玩得太过保守，他们过分强调避免被击中，因此很少赢得比赛。

Relevant lessons from sports (included in past memos) are easily accessed and also very helpful:  

从过去备忘录中包含的体育相关课程中轻松获取并且非常有帮助

-   “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” – Wayne Gretzky, NHL Hall of Famer  
    
    “不尝试就错过 100%的机会。” - 韦恩·格雷茨基，NHL 名人堂成员
    
-   “You have to give yourself a chance to fail.” – Kenny “The Jet” Smith, two-time NBA champion  
    
    “你必须给自己失败的可能性。” - Kenny “The Jet” Smith, 两届 NBA 冠军
    

I’ll sum up with a paragraph from my memo of last September, [_Fewer Losers, or More Winners?_](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/fewer-losers-or-more-winners)  The final sentence says a great deal about sacrifice and risk:  

我将用去年九月备忘录中的一段话作总结，是少输者，还是多赢者？最后一句话谈到了牺牲和风险

. . . not having any losers isn’t a useful goal.  

不让任何人失败并不是一个实际可行的目标。  

 The only sure way to achieve that is by not taking any risk.  

唯一确保实现这一目标的方法是不冒任何风险。  

 But … risk avoidance is likely to result in return avoidance.  

但是...避免风险很可能导致回避回报。  

 There’s such a thing as the risk of taking too little risk.  

冒太小的风险也是一种风险。  

 Most people understand this intellectually, but **human nature makes it hard for many to accept the idea that the willingness to live with some losses is an essential ingredient in investment success.**  

大多数人在理智上能理解这一点，但人性使许多人难以接受这样一个观念：愿意承受一定损失是投资成功的重要因素。

How to Think About Risk-Taking  

如何正确看待风险承担

The paradox of risk-taking is inescapable.  

冒险的悖论是无法摆脱的。  

 You have to take it to be successful in competitive, high-aspiration arenas.  

为了在竞争激烈、高志向的领域取得成功，你必须拿出来。  

 But taking it doesn’t mean you’ll be successful; that’s why they call it risk.  

但是拿取风险并不代表你会成功；这就是为什么他们称之为风险。

Equally paradoxical, earning a high rate of return over a long time period doesn’t have to – and usually doesn’t – connote a record of consistent success.  

长时间内获得高回报并不一定代表（通常也不代表）持续成功的记录。  

 More often it results from having made a lot of well-reasoned investments, some subset of which worked out well.  

更多时候，这是因为做了许多经过深思熟虑的投资，其中一些投资取得了成功。  

 Here’s how I described the basis for the success of Berkshire Hathaway in _Fewer Losers, or More Winners?_:  

这是我在《少输者，多赢者？》中描述伯克希尔哈撒韦成功基础的方式：

I believe the ingredients of Warren \[Buffett\]’s and Charlie \[Munger\]’s great performance are simple: (a) a lot of investments in which they did decently, (b) a relatively small number of big winners that they invested in heavily and held for decades, and (c) relatively few big losers.  

我相信沃伦·巴菲特和查理·芒格表现出色的原因很简单：(a) 他们投资了很多表现不错的项目，(b) 投资了相对较少但规模庞大的赢家，并且持有了几十年，以及(c) 相对较少的输家。  

 No one should expect to have – or expect their money managers to have – all big winners and no losers.  

没有人应该期望自己或者期望他们的资金管理者只有赢家没有输家。

**Investors must accept that success is likely to stem from making a large number of investments, all of which you make because you expect them to succeed, but some portion of which you know won’t.** You have to put it all out there. You have to take a shot.  

投资者必须接受，成功很可能来自于进行大量投资，所有这些投资都是因为你期望它们成功，但你知道其中有一部分是不会成功的。你必须全力以赴，你必须敢于一试。  

 Not every effort will be rewarded with high returns, but hopefully enough will do so to produce success over the long term.  

并非每次努力都会带来高回报，但希望足够多的努力能够在长期内取得成功。  

 That success will ultimately be a function of the ratio of winners to losers, and of the magnitude of the losses relative to the gains.  

成功的实现最终取决于赢家与输家的比例，以及损失相对于收益的大小。  

 But refusal to take risk in this process is unlikely to get you where you want to go.  

但是在这个过程中，不愿冒险是不太可能让你达到目标的。

I’ll conclude with another good paragraph from Ashley:  

我将以阿什利的另一段优秀段落作为结束

Taking a chance doesn’t mean there will be a successful outcome, nor does it require it.  

冒险并不意味着一定会成功，也并非必须如此。  

 If the reasons are sound, the risk should be taken almost reflexively.  

如果理由充分，风险几乎应该毫不犹豫地采取。  

 The more often we trust our judgment, the more confidence we gain in our decision-making capacity.  

我们越是信任自己的判断，就越能增强我们的决策能力。  

 The courage to take risks becomes a worthwhile end in itself.  

敢于冒险本身就是一种值得的勇气。

The bottom line on the quest for superior investment returns is clear: **You shouldn’t expect to make money without bearing risk, but you shouldn’t expect to make money just for taking risk.  

在追求卓越投资回报的过程中，底线很明确：您不应该指望在不承担风险的情况下赚钱，但也不应该仅仅因为承担风险就指望赚钱。  

 You have to sacrifice certainty, but it has to be done skillfully and intelligently, and with emotion under control.  

你需要牺牲一些确定性，但必须做到技巧和智慧，同时保持情绪的控制。**

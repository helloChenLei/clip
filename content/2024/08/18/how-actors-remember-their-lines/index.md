In describing how they remember their lines, actors are telling us an important truth about memory.

After a recent theater performance, I remained in the audience as the actors assembled on stage to discuss the current play and the upcoming production that they were rehearsing.  

在最近的一场戏剧演出后，我留在观众席，演员们在舞台上聚集讨论当前的剧目以及他们正在排练的即将上演的作品。  

Because each actor had many lines to remember, my curiosity led me to ask a question they frequently hear: “How do you learn all of those lines?”  

由于每位演员都有许多台词需要记忆，我的好奇心让我问了一个他们常常听到的问题：“你是如何记住这些台词的？”

Actors face the demanding task of learning their lines with great precision, but they rarely do so by rote repetition.  

演员们面临着一项艰巨的任务，需要以极高的准确性来学习台词，但他们很少通过死记硬背来完成。  

They did not, they said, sit down with a script and recite their lines until they knew them by heart.  

他们并没有坐下来背诵剧本，直到能熟记每一句台词。  

Repeating items over and over, called _maintenance rehearsal_, is not the most effective strategy for remembering. Instead, actors engage in _elaborative rehearsal_, focusing their attention on the meaning of the material and associating it with information they already know.  

一味重复信息（称为维持性复述）并不是最有效的记忆策略。相反，演员们采用阐发性复述，专注于材料的含义，并将其与已有知识相联系。  

Actors study the script, trying to understand their character and seeing how their lines relate to that character.  

演员们研究剧本，努力理解自己的角色，并分析他们的台词与角色之间的关系。  

In describing these elaborative processes, the actors assembled that evening offered sound advice for effective remembering.  

在描述这些复杂的过程时，那天晚上聚集的参与者们提供了有效记忆的宝贵建议。

Similarly, when psychologists Helga and Tony Noice [surveyed actors on how they learn their lines](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00398.x?journalCode=cdpa), they found that actors search for meaning in the script, rather than memorizing lines.  

同样，当心理学家赫尔加和托尼·诺伊斯调查演员如何记住台词时，他们发现演员更倾向于在剧本中寻找意义，而不是仅仅死记硬背。  

The actors imagine the character in each scene, adopt the character’s perspective, relate new material to the character’s background, and try to match the character’s mood.  

演员在每个场景中想象角色，从角色的视角出发，将新材料与角色的背景相结合，并努力与角色的情绪保持一致。  

Script lines are carefully analyzed to understand the character’s motivation.  

剧本中的台词经过仔细分析，以便理解角色的动机。  

This deep understanding of a script is achieved by actors asking goal-directed questions, such as “Am I angry with her when I say this?” Later, during a performance, this deep understanding provides the context for the lines to be recalled naturally, rather than recited from a memorized text.  

演员通过提出目标导向的问题，例如“我在说这句话时对她生气吗？”来实现对剧本的深刻理解。在表演时，这种理解为台词的自然回忆提供了背景，而不是单纯地背诵记忆的文本。  

In his book “[Acting in Film](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781557832771/Acting-in-Film-An-Actor%27s-Take-on-Movie-Making),” actor Michael Caine described this process well:  

在他的书《电影表演》中，演员迈克尔·凯恩对这个过程进行了很好的描述：

> You must be able to stand there not thinking of that line. You take it off the other actor’s face.  
> 
> 你必须能够站在那里，不去想那条台词。你把它从另一个演员的脸上去掉。  
> 
> Otherwise, for your next line, you’re not listening and not free to respond naturally, to act spontaneously.  
> 
> 否则，对于你的下一句话，你既没有倾听，也无法自由自然地回应，无法自发地行动。

This same process of learning and remembering lines by deep understanding enabled a septuagenarian actor to recite all 10,565 lines of Milton’s epic poem, “Paradise Lost.” At the age of 58, John Basinger began studying this poem as a form of mental activity to accompany his physical activity at the gym, each time adding more lines to what he had already learned.  

这种通过深刻理解来学习和记忆台词的过程，使一位七旬演员能够背诵米尔顿的史诗《失乐园》中的全部 10,565 行。约翰·巴辛格在 58 岁时开始学习这首诗，作为一种与他在健身房锻炼相辅相成的心理活动，每次都在他已经掌握的基础上增加更多的台词。  

Eight years later, he had committed the entire poem to memory, reciting it over three days. When I [tested him at age 74](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211003781522), giving him randomly drawn couplets from the poem and asking him to recite the next ten lines, his recall was nearly flawless.  

八年后，他已经将整首诗背得滚瓜烂熟，连续三天进行朗诵。当我在他 74 岁时测试他，随机抽取诗句让他背诵接下来的十行时，他的记忆几乎完美无误。  

Yet, he did not accomplish this feat through mindless repetition.  

然而，他并不是通过机械的重复来实现这个壮举的。  

In the course of studying the poem, he came to a deep understanding of Milton. Said Basinger:  

在研究这首诗的过程中，他对米尔顿有了更深刻的理解。巴辛格说道：

> During the incessant repetition of Milton’s words, I really began to listen to them, and every now and then as the poem began to take shape in my mind, an insight would come, an understanding, a delicious possibility.  
> 
> 在米尔顿的话语不断重复的过程中，我开始真正倾听它们。每当诗歌在我脑海中逐渐成形时，便会闪现出一种洞察，一种理解，一种令人愉悦的可能性。

In describing how they remember their lines, actors are telling us an important truth about memory — deep understanding promotes long-lasting memories.  

演员在描述他们如何记住台词时，向我们揭示了一个关于记忆的重要真理：深刻的理解能够促进持久的记忆。

### **A Memory Strategy for Everyone  

适合每个人的记忆策略**

Deep understanding involves focusing your attention on the underlying meaning of an item or event, and each of us can use this strategy to enhance everyday retention.  

深刻理解意味着关注事物或事件的深层含义，我们每个人都可以运用这一策略来提高日常记忆力。  

In picking up an apple at the grocers, for example, you can look at its color and size, you can say its name, and you can think of its nutritional value and use in a favorite recipe.  

例如，在杂货店挑选一个苹果时，你可以观察它的颜色和大小，能够说出它的名字，并且想到它的营养价值以及在你喜欢的食谱中的用法。  

Focusing on these visual, acoustic, and conceptual aspects of the apple correspond to shallow, moderate, and deep levels of processing, and the _depth of processing_ that is devoted to an item or event affects its memorability.  

专注于苹果的视觉、听觉和概念特征，分别对应浅层、中等和深层的加工，而对某个事物或事件的加工深度会影响其记忆效果。  

Memory is typically enhanced when we engage in deep processing that provides meaning for an item or event, rather than shallow processing.  

当我们进行深度处理，为某个事物或事件赋予意义时，记忆通常会得到增强，而不是进行浅层处理。  

Given a list of common nouns to read, [people recall more words on a surprise memory test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022537173800271) if they previously attended to the meaning of each word than if they focused on each word’s font or sound.  

如果人们在阅读一系列常见名词时关注每个词的意义，那么在一次意外的记忆测试中，他们能回忆起更多的单词，而不是关注每个词的字体或发音。

Deep, elaborative processing enhances understanding by relating something you are trying to learn to things you already known.  

深入而详尽的思考通过将你想学习的内容与已知事物相联系，能够增强理解力。  

Retention is enhanced because elaboration produces more meaningful associations than does shallow processing — links that can serve as potential cues for later remembering.  

由于深入阐述产生的关联比浅层处理更有意义，因此增强了记忆的保持，这些关联可以作为后续记忆的潜在提示。  

For example, your ease of recalling the name of a specific dwarf in Walt Disney’s animated film, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” depends on the cue and its associated meaning:  

例如，你能否轻松回忆起沃尔特·迪士尼动画电影《白雪公主与七个小矮人》中某个特定小矮人的名字，取决于提示及其相关含义：

_Try to recall the name of the dwarf that begins with the letter B.  

试着想想哪个矮人的名字是以字母 B 开头的。_

People often have a hard time coming up with the correct name with this cue because many common names begin with the letter _B_ and all of them are wrong. Try it again with a more meaningful cue:  

人们常常很难根据这个提示想出正确的名字，因为许多常见名字都是以字母 B 开头，而这些名字都是错误的。请再试一次，使用一个更有意义的提示：

_Recall the name of the dwarf whose name is synonymous with shyness.  

想想那个名字与害羞同义的矮人叫什么。_

If you know the Disney film, this time the answer is easy.  

如果你了解迪士尼的电影，这次的答案就很简单。  

Meaningful associations help us remember, and elaborative processing produces more semantic associations than does shallow processing.  

有意义的联想有助于我们的记忆，而深入加工所产生的语义联想比浅层加工要丰富得多。  

This is why the meaningful cue produces the name _Bashful_.  

这就是为什么这个有意义的提示会产生“害羞”这个名字。

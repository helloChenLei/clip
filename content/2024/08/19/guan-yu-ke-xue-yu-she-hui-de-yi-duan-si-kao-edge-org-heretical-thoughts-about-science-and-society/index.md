**1\. The Need for Heretics  

1\. 对异端的需求**

In the modern world, science and society often interact in a perverse way.  

在现代社会中，科学与社会常常以一种扭曲的方式相互作用。  

We live in a technological society, and technology causes political problems. The politicians and the public expect science to provide answers to the problems. Scientific experts are paid and encouraged to provide answers.  

我们生活在一个科技社会中，科技引发了许多政治问题。政治家和公众希望科学能够为这些问题提供解决方案，因此科学专家们也因此获得报酬并受到鼓励去提供答案。  

The public does not have much use for a scientist who says, “Sorry, but we don’t know”.  

公众对一个说“抱歉，我们不知道”的科学家并不太感兴趣。  

The public prefers to listen to scientists who give confident answers to questions and make confident predictions of what will happen as a result of human activities.  

公众更喜欢听那些能够自信回答问题并对人类活动后果做出准确预测的科学家。  

So it happens that the experts who talk publicly about politically contentious questions tend to speak more clearly than they think.  

因此，公开讨论政治争议问题的专家往往比他们自己认为的更清晰。  

They make confident predictions about the future, and end up believing their own predictions.  

他们对未来充满信心地做出预测，最终也相信了自己的预测。  

Their predictions become dogmas which they do not question.  

他们的预测变成了不容质疑的教条。  

The public is led to believe that the fashionable scientific dogmas are true, and it may sometimes happen that they are wrong.  

公众被引导相信流行的科学理论是正确的，但有时这些理论可能是错误的。  

That is why heretics who question the dogmas are needed.   

这就是为什么质疑教义的异端是必不可少的。

As a scientist I do not have much faith in predictions. Science is organized unpredictability.  

作为一名科学家，我对预测并不抱太大信心。科学就是有序的不可预测性。  

The best scientists like to arrange things in an experiment to be as unpredictable as possible, and then they do the experiment to see what will happen.  

最优秀的科学家喜欢将实验中的事物安排得尽量不可预测，然后进行实验以观察结果。  

You might say that if something is predictable then it is not science.  

你可能会说，如果某件事是可以预测的，那它就不算是科学。  

When I make predictions, I am not speaking as a scientist. I am speaking as a story-teller, and my predictions are science-fiction rather than science.  

当我做出预测时，我并不是以科学家的身份发言，而是以讲故事者的身份。我所做的预测更像是科幻小说，而非科学。  

The predictions of science-fiction writers are notoriously inaccurate.  

科幻作家的预测常常不准确。  

Their purpose is to imagine what might happen rather than to describe what will happen.  

他们的目的是设想可能发生的情况，而不是描述将要发生的事情。  

I will be telling stories that challenge the prevailing dogmas of today.  

我会讲述一些挑战当今主流观念的故事。  

The prevailing dogmas may be right, but they still need to be challenged.  

现有的教条可能是对的，但仍然需要受到挑战。  

I am proud to be a heretic.  

我为自己是个异端而感到自豪。  

The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies.  

世界总是需要异端来挑战主流的正统思想。  

Since I am heretic, I am accustomed to being in the minority.  

作为一个异教徒，我已经习惯了身处少数。  

If I could persuade everyone to agree with me, I would not be a heretic.   

如果我能说服每个人都同意我的观点，我就不会被视为异端。

We are lucky that we can be heretics today without any danger of being burned at the stake.  

我们很幸运，今天可以做异教徒而不必担心被烧死。  

But unfortunately I am an old heretic. Old heretics do not cut much ice.  

可惜我是一位老异教徒，老异教徒并不被重视。  

When you hear an old heretic talking, you can always say, “Too bad he has lost his marbles”, and pass on.  

当你听到一个老异教徒在说话时，你可以说：“真可惜，他失去了理智”，然后就可以离开了。  

What the world needs is young heretics.  

世界需要年轻的异议者。  

I am hoping that one or two of the people who read this piece may fill that role.   

我希望能有一两位阅读这篇文章的人来担任这个角色。

Two years ago, I was at Cornell University celebrating the life of Tommy Gold, a famous astronomer who died at a ripe old age.  

两年前，我在康奈尔大学庆祝著名天文学家汤米·戈德的生平，他活到了高龄。  

He was famous as a heretic, promoting unpopular ideas that usually turned out to be right.  

他因作为异端而闻名，倡导一些通常不受欢迎的观点，而这些观点往往最终被证明是正确的。  

Long ago I was a guinea-pig in Tommy’s experiments on human hearing.  

很久以前，我曾是汤米进行人类听力实验的豚鼠。  

He had a heretical idea that the human ear discriminates pitch by means of a set of tuned resonators with active electromechanical feedback.  

他有一个异端的想法，认为人耳是通过一组调谐的共振器和主动的机电反馈来区分音高的。  

He published a paper explaining how the ear must work, \[Gold, 1948\].  

他发表了一篇论文，阐述了耳朵的工作原理，\[Gold, 1948\]。  

He described how the vibrations of the inner ear must be converted into electrical signals which feed back into the mechanical motion, reinforcing the vibrations and increasing the sharpness of the resonance.  

他描述了内耳的振动如何转化为电信号，这些信号再反馈到机械运动中，从而增强振动并提高共鸣的清晰度。  

The experts in auditory physiology ignored his work because he did not have a degree in physiology.  

听觉生理学的专家忽视了他的研究，因为他没有获得生理学学位。  

Many years later, the experts discovered the two kinds of hair-cells in the inner ear that actually do the feedback as Tommy had predicted, one kind of hair-cell acting as electrical sensors and the other kind acting as mechanical drivers.  

多年后，专家们发现内耳中有两种毛细胞，正如汤米所预测的那样，它们负责反馈。一种毛细胞充当电传感器，另一种则作为机械驱动器。  

It took the experts forty years to admit that he was right.  

专家们花了四十年才承认他是正确的。  

Of course, I knew that he was right, because I had helped him do the experiments.   

当然，我知道他是对的，因为我帮他做了实验。

Later in his life, Tommy Gold promoted another heretical idea, that the oil and natural gas in the ground come up from deep in the mantle of the earth and have nothing to do with biology.  

在他晚年的时候，汤米·戈德提出了一个异端的观点，认为地下的石油和天然气源自地球深处的地幔，和生物没有关系。  

Again the experts are sure that he is wrong, and he did not live long enough to change their minds.  

专家们再次确认他是错误的，而且他活得不够久，无法改变他们的看法。  

Just a few weeks before he died, some chemists at the Carnegie Institution in Washington did a beautiful experiment in a diamond anvil cell, \[Scott et al., 2004\].  

就在他去世前的几周，华盛顿卡内基研究所的一些化学家在一个钻石压砧中进行了一个精彩的实验，\[Scott et al., 2004\]。  

They mixed together tiny quantities of three things that we know exist in the mantle of the earth, and observed them at the pressure and temperature appropriate to the mantle about two hundred kilometers down.  

他们将三种已知存在于地球地幔中的物质以微小的量混合，并在约两百公里深的地幔适宜的压力和温度下进行观察。  

The three things were calcium carbonate which is sedimentary rock, iron oxide which is a component of igneous rock, and water.  

这三种物质分别是碳酸钙（沉积岩）、氧化铁（火成岩的成分）和水。  

These three things are certainly present when a slab of subducted ocean floor descends from a deep ocean trench into the mantle.  

当一块被俯冲的海洋地壳从深海沟降入地幔时，这三件事肯定会出现。  

The experiment showed that they react quickly to produce lots of methane, which is natural gas.  

实验表明它们反应迅速，能够产生大量甲烷，这是一种天然气。  

Knowing the result of the experiment, we can be sure that big quantities of natural gas exist in the mantle two hundred kilometers down.  

根据实验结果，我们可以确认在两百公里深的地幔中存在大量天然气。  

We do not know how much of this natural gas pushes its way up through cracks and channels in the overlying rock to form the shallow reservoirs of natural gas that we are now burning.  

我们并不清楚有多少天然气通过上层岩石的裂缝和通道上升，形成了我们现在所燃烧的浅层天然气储藏。  

If the gas moves up rapidly enough, it will arrive intact in the cooler regions where the reservoirs are found.  

如果气体上升得足够快，它将完整地到达储藏层所在的较冷地区。  

If it moves too slowly through the hot region, the methane may be reconverted to carbonate rock and water.  

如果它在高温区域移动得太慢，甲烷可能会重新转化为碳酸盐岩和水。  

The Carnegie Institute experiment shows that there is at least a possibility that Tommy Gold was right and the natural gas reservoirs are fed from deep below.  

卡内基研究所的实验表明，汤米·戈尔的观点至少有可能是正确的，天然气储层是来自深层的补给。  

The chemists sent an E-mail to Tommy Gold to tell him their result, and got back a message that he had died three days earlier.  

化学家们给汤米·戈德发了一封电子邮件，告知他他们的研究结果，结果收到的回复是他三天前去世了。  

Now that he is dead, we need more heretics to take his place.  

现在他已经去世，我们需要更多的异教徒来接替他。

**2\. Climate and Land Management  

2\. 气候与土地管理措施**

The main subject of this piece is the problem of climate change.  

这篇文章的主要内容是气候变化所带来的问题。  

This is a contentious subject, involving politics and economics as well as science.  

这是一个颇具争议的话题，涉及政治、经济以及科学。  

The science is inextricably mixed up with politics.  

科学与政治是紧密相连的。  

Everyone agrees that the climate is changing, but there are violently diverging opinions about the causes of change, about the consequences of change, and about possible remedies.  

大家都同意气候正在变化，但对于变化的原因、后果以及可能的解决方案却有着截然不同的看法。  

I am promoting a heretical opinion, the first of three heresies that I will discuss in this piece.   

我正在推广一种异端观点，这是我将在本文中讨论的三种异端中的第一种。

My first heresy says that all the fuss about global warming is grossly exaggerated.  

我第一次的异端观点是，关于全球变暖的所有争论都是严重夸大的。  

Here I am opposing the holy brotherhood of climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens who believe the numbers predicted by the computer models.  

我在反对气候模型专家的神圣兄弟会，以及那些相信计算机模型预测结果的误导公民。  

Of course, they say, I have no degree in meteorology and I am therefore not qualified to speak.  

当然，他们说，我没有气象学的学位，因此不具备发言的资格。  

But I have studied the climate models and I know what they can do.  

但是我研究过气候模型，知道它们的功能。  

The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans.  

这些模型能够很好地解决流体动力学方程，并准确描述大气和海洋中的流体运动。  

They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests.  

他们对云彩、尘土、田野、农场和森林的化学与生物特征描述得非常不够。  

They do not begin to describe the real world that we live in.  

他们并没有真正描述我们所生活的世界。  

The real world is muddy and messy and full of things that we do not yet understand.  

现实世界复杂而混乱，充满了我们尚未理解的事物。  

It is much easier for a scientist to sit in an air-conditioned building and run computer models, than to put on winter clothes and measure what is really happening outside in the swamps and the clouds.  

对于科学家来说，坐在空调的建筑里运行计算机模型，比穿上冬装去测量沼泽和云层中真实情况要容易得多。  

That is why the climate model experts end up believing their own models.   

这就是气候模型专家最终会相信自己模型的原因。

There is no doubt that parts of the world are getting warmer, but the warming is not global.  

毫无疑问，世界上某些地区正在变暖，但这种变暖并不是全球性的。  

I am not saying that the warming does not cause problems. Obviously it does.  

我并不是说全球变暖不会带来问题，显然它会。  

Obviously we should be trying to understand it better.  

显然，我们应该更深入地理解它。  

I am saying that the problems are grossly exaggerated.  

我是说这些问题被极大地夸大了。  

They take away money and attention from other problems that are more urgent and more important, such as poverty and infectious disease and public education and public health, and the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans, not to mention easy problems such as the timely construction of adequate dikes around the city of New Orleans.  

他们将金钱和注意力从其他更紧迫、更重要的问题中抽走，比如贫困、传染病、公共教育和公共卫生，以及陆地和海洋中生物的保护，更不用说像及时在新奥尔良市周围修建足够的堤坝这样的简单问题。  

 

I will discuss the global warming problem in detail because it is interesting, even though its importance is exaggerated.  

我将详细讨论全球变暖问题，因为它非常有趣，尽管其重要性常常被夸大。  

One of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas.  

全球变暖的主要原因之一是我们燃烧化石燃料（如石油、煤炭和天然气）导致大气中二氧化碳浓度的增加。  

To understand the movement of carbon through the atmosphere and biosphere, we need to measure a lot of numbers.  

要理解碳在大气和生物圈中的循环，我们需要测量许多数据。  

I do not want to confuse you with a lot of numbers, so I will ask you to remember just one number.  

我不想用太多数字让你感到困惑，所以我只请你记住一个数字。  

The number that I ask you to remember is one hundredth of an inch per year.  

我希望你记住的数字是每年一百分之一英寸。  

Now I will explain what this number means.  

现在我来解释一下这个数字代表什么。  

Consider the half of the land area of the earth that is not desert or ice-cap or city or road or parking-lot.  

考虑地球上不包括沙漠、冰盖、城市、道路或停车场的土地面积的一半。  

This is the half of the land that is covered with soil and supports vegetation of one kind or another.  

这是覆盖着土壤并支持各种植被的土地的一半。  

Every year, it absorbs and converts into biomass a certain fraction of the carbon dioxide that we emit into the atmosphere.  

每年，它会吸收并将我们排放到大气中的一部分二氧化碳转化为生物量。  

Biomass means living creatures, plants and microbes and animals, and the organic materials that are left behind when the creatures die and decay.  

生物质指的是生物、植物、微生物和动物，以及它们死亡和腐烂后留下的有机物质。  

We don’t know how big a fraction of our emissions is absorbed by the land, since we have not measured the increase or decrease of the biomass.  

我们不知道我们的排放中有多少被土地吸收，因为我们没有测量生物量的增减。  

The number that I ask you to remember is the increase in thickness, averaged over one half of the land area of the planet, of the biomass that would result if all the carbon that we are emitting by burning fossil fuels were absorbed.  

我请你记住的数字是，如果我们燃烧化石燃料所排放的所有碳都被吸收，那么在地球一半的土地面积上，生物量的厚度平均会增加多少。  

The average increase in thickness is one hundredth of an inch per year.   

每年的平均厚度增加为 0.01 英寸。

The point of this calculation is the very favorable rate of exchange between carbon in the atmosphere and carbon in the soil.  

  

To stop the carbon in the atmosphere from increasing, we only need to grow the biomass in the soil by a hundredth of an inch per year.  

为了防止大气中的碳含量增加，我们只需每年在土壤中增加千分之一英寸的生物量。  

Good topsoil contains about ten percent biomass, \[Schlesinger, 1977\], so a hundredth of an inch of biomass growth means about a tenth of an inch of topsoil.  

  

Changes in farming practices such as no-till farming, avoiding the use of the plow, cause biomass to grow at least as fast as this.  

  

If we plant crops without plowing the soil, more of the biomass goes into roots which stay in the soil, and less returns to the atmosphere.  

  

If we use genetic engineering to put more biomass into roots, we can probably achieve much more rapid growth of topsoil.  

  

I conclude from this calculation that the problem of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a problem of land management, not a problem of meteorology.  

  

No computer model of atmosphere and ocean can hope to predict the way we shall manage our land.   

Here is another heretical thought.  

  

Instead of calculating world-wide averages of biomass growth, we may prefer to look at the problem locally.  

  

Consider a possible future, with China continuing to develop an industrial economy based largely on the burning of coal, and the United States deciding to absorb the resulting carbon dioxide by increasing the biomass in our topsoil.  

  

The quantity of biomass that can be accumulated in living plants and trees is limited, but there is no limit to the quantity that can be stored in topsoil.  

  

To grow topsoil on a massive scale may or may not be practical, depending on the economics of farming and forestry.  

  

It is at least a possibility to be seriously considered, that China could become rich by burning coal, while the United States could become environmentally virtuous by accumulating topsoil, with transport of carbon from mine in China to soil in America provided free of charge by the atmosphere, and the inventory of carbon in the atmosphere remaining constant.  

  

We should take such possibilities into account when we listen to predictions about climate change and fossil fuels.  

  

If biotechnology takes over the planet in the next fifty years, as computer technology has taken it over in the last fifty years, the rules of the climate game will be radically changed.  

  

 

When I listen to the public debates about climate change, I am impressed by the enormous gaps in our knowledge, the sparseness of our observations and the superficiality of our theories.  

  

Many of the basic processes of planetary ecology are poorly understood.  

  

They must be better understood before we can reach an accurate diagnosis of the present condition of our planet.  

  

When we are trying to take care of a planet, just as when we are taking care of a human patient, diseases must be diagnosed before they can be cured.  

  

We need to observe and measure what is going on in the biosphere, rather than relying on computer models.  

  

 

Everyone agrees that the increasing abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has two important consequences, first a change in the physics of radiation transport in the atmosphere, and second a change in the biology of plants on the ground and in the ocean.  

  

Opinions differ on the relative importance of the physical and biological effects, and on whether the effects, either separately or together, are beneficial or harmful.  

  

The physical effects are seen in changes of rainfall, cloudiness, wind-strength and temperature, which are customarily lumped together in the misleading phrase “global warming”.  

  

In humid air, the effect of carbon dioxide on radiation transport is unimportant because the transport of thermal radiation is already blocked by the much larger greenhouse effect of water vapor.  

  

The effect of carbon dioxide is important where the air is dry, and air is usually dry only where it is cold.  

  

Hot desert air may feel dry but often contains a lot of water vapor.  

  

The warming effect of carbon dioxide is strongest where air is cold and dry, mainly in the arctic rather than in the tropics, mainly in mountainous regions rather than in lowlands, mainly in winter rather than in summer, and mainly at night rather than in daytime.  

  

The warming is real, but it is mostly making cold places warmer rather than making hot places hotter.  

  

To represent this local warming by a global average is misleading.   

The fundamental reason why carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is critically important to biology is that there is so little of it.  

  

A field of corn growing in full sunlight in the middle of the day uses up all the carbon dioxide within a meter of the ground in about five minutes.  

  

If the air were not constantly stirred by convection currents and winds, the corn would stop growing.  

  

About a tenth of all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is converted into biomass every summer and given back to the atmosphere every fall.  

  

That is why the effects of fossil-fuel burning cannot be separated from the effects of plant growth and decay.  

  

There are five reservoirs of carbon that are biologically accessible on a short time-scale, not counting the carbonate rocks and the deep ocean which are only accessible on a time-scale of thousands of years.  

  

The five accessible reservoirs are the atmosphere, the land plants, the topsoil in which land plants grow, the surface layer of the ocean in which ocean plants grow, and our proved reserves of fossil fuels.  

  

The atmosphere is the smallest reservoir and the fossil fuels are the largest, but all five reservoirs are of comparable size.  

  

They all interact strongly with one another.  

  

To understand any of them, it is necessary to understand all of them.   

As an example of the way different reservoirs of carbon dioxide may interact with each other, consider the atmosphere and the topsoil.  

  

Greenhouse experiments show that many plants growing in an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide react by increasing their root-to-shoot ratio.  

  

This means that the plants put more of their growth into roots and less into stems and leaves.  

  

A change in this direction is to be expected, because the plants have to maintain a balance between the leaves collecting carbon from the air and the roots collecting mineral nutrients from the soil.  

  

The enriched atmosphere tilts the balance so that the plants need less leaf-area and more root-area.  

  

Now consider what happens to the roots and shoots when the growing season is over, when the leaves fall and the plants die.  

  

The new-grown biomass decays and is eaten by fungi or microbes.  

  

Some of it returns to the atmosphere and some of it is converted into topsoil.  

  

On the average, more of the above-ground growth will return to the atmosphere and more of the below-ground growth will become topsoil.  

  

So the plants with increased root-to-shoot ratio will cause an increased transfer of carbon from the atmosphere into topsoil.  

  

If the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil-fuel burning has caused an increase in the average root-to-shoot ratio of plants over large areas, then the possible effect on the top-soil reservoir will not be small.  

  

At present we have no way to measure or even to guess the size of this effect.  

  

The aggregate biomass of the topsoil of the planet is not a measurable quantity.  

  

But the fact that the topsoil is unmeasurable does not mean that it is unimportant.   

At present we do not know whether the topsoil of the United States is increasing or decreasing.  

  

Over the rest of the world, because of large-scale deforestation and erosion, the topsoil reservoir is probably decreasing.  

  

We do not know whether intelligent land-management could increase the growth of the topsoil reservoir by four billion tons of carbon per year, the amount needed to stop the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  

  

All that we can say for sure is that this is a theoretical possibility and ought to be seriously explored.  

**3\. Oceans and Ice-ages  

**

Another problem that has to be taken seriously is a slow rise of sea level which could become catastrophic if it continues to accelerate.  

  

We have accurate measurements of sea level going back two hundred years.  

  

We observe a steady rise from 1800 to the present, with an acceleration during the last fifty years.  

  

It is widely believed that the recent acceleration is due to human activities, since it coincides in time with the rapid increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  

  

But the rise from 1800 to 1900 was probably not due to human activities.  

  

The scale of industrial activities in the nineteenth century was not large enough to have had measurable global effects.  

  

So a large part of the observed rise in sea level must have other causes.  

  

One possible cause is a slow readjustment of the shape of the earth to the disappearance of the northern ice-sheets at the end of the ice age twelve thousand years ago.  

  

Another possible cause is the large-scale melting of glaciers, which also began long before human influences on climate became significant.  

  

Once again, we have an environmental danger whose magnitude cannot be predicted until we know more about its causes, \[Munk, 2002\].  

  

 

The most alarming possible cause of sea-level rise is a rapid disintegration of the West Antarctic ice-sheet, which is the part of Antarctica where the bottom of the ice is far below sea level.  

  

Warming seas around the edge of Antarctica might erode the ice-cap from below and cause it to collapse into the ocean.  

  

If the whole of West Antarctica disintegrated rapidly, sea-level would rise by five meters, with disastrous effects on billions of people.  

  

However, recent measurements of the ice-cap show that it is not losing volume fast enough to make a significant contribution to the presently observed sea-level rise.  

  

It appears that the warming seas around Antarctica are causing an increase in snowfall over the ice-cap, and the increased snowfall on top roughly cancels out the decrease of ice volume caused by erosion at the edges.  

  

The same changes, increased melting of ice at the edges and increased snowfall adding ice on top, are also observed in Greenland.  

  

In addition, there is an increase in snowfall over the East Antarctic Ice-cap, which is much larger and colder and is in no danger of melting.  

  

This is another situation where we do not know how much of the environmental change is due to human activities and how much to long-term natural processes over which we have no control.  

  

 

Another environmental danger that is even more poorly understood is the possible coming of a new ice-age.  

  

A new ice-age would mean the burial of half of North America and half of Europe under massive ice-sheets.  

  

We know that there is a natural cycle that has been operating for the last eight hundred thousand years.  

  

The length of the cycle is a hundred thousand years.  

  

In each hundred-thousand year period, there is an ice-age that lasts about ninety thousand years and a warm interglacial period that lasts about ten thousand years.  

  

We are at present in a warm period that began twelve thousand years ago, so the onset of the next ice-age is overdue.  

  

If human activities were not disturbing the climate, a new ice-age might already have begun.  

  

We do not know how to answer the most important question: do our human activities in general, and our burning of fossil fuels in particular, make the onset of the next ice-age more likely or less likely?  

  

 

There are good arguments on both sides of this question.  

  

On the one side, we know that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much lower during past ice-ages than during warm periods, so it is reasonable to expect that an artificially high level of carbon dioxide might stop an ice-age from beginning.  

  

On the other side, the oceanographer Wallace Broecker \[Broecker, 1997\] has argued that the present warm climate in Europe depends on a circulation of ocean water, with the Gulf Stream flowing north on the surface and bringing warmth to Europe, and with a counter-current of cold water flowing south in the deep ocean.  

  

So a new ice-age could begin whenever the cold deep counter-current is interrupted.  

  

The counter-current could be interrupted when the surface water in the Arctic becomes less salty and fails to sink, and the water could become less salty when the warming climate increases the Arctic rainfall.  

  

Thus Broecker argues that a warm climate in the Arctic may paradoxically cause an ice-age to begin.  

  

Since we are confronted with two plausible arguments leading to opposite conclusions, the only rational response is to admit our ignorance.  

  

Until the causes of ice-ages are understood, we cannot know whether the increase of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing or decreasing the danger.  

**4\. The Wet Sahara  

**

My second heresy is also concerned with climate change. It is about the mystery of the wet Sahara.  

  

This is a mystery that has always fascinated me.  

  

At many places in the Sahara desert that are now dry and unpopulated, we find rock-paintings showing people with herds of animals.  

  

The paintings are abundant, and some of them are of high artistic quality, comparable with the more famous cave-paintings in France and Spain.  

  

The Sahara paintings are more recent than the cave-paintings.  

  

They come in a variety of styles and were probably painted over a period of several thousand years.  

  

The latest of them show Egyptian influences and may be contemporaneous with early Egyptian tomb paintings.  

  

Henri Lhote’s book, “The Search for the Tassili Frescoes”, \[Lhote, 1958\], is illustrated with reproductions of fifty of the paintings.  

  

The best of the herd paintings date from roughly six thousand years ago.  

  

They are strong evidence that the Sahara at that time was wet.  

  

There was enough rain to support herds of cows and giraffes, which must have grazed on grass and trees.  

  

There were also some hippopotamuses and elephants.  

  

The Sahara then must have been like the Serengeti today.   

At the same time, roughly six thousand years ago, there were deciduous forests in Northern Europe where the trees are now conifers, proving that the climate in the far north was milder than it is today.  

  

There were also trees standing in mountain valleys in Switzerland that are now filled with famous glaciers.  

  

The glaciers that are now shrinking were much smaller six thousand years ago than they are today.  

  

Six thousand years ago seems to have been the warmest and wettest period of the interglacial era that began twelve thousand years ago when the last Ice Age ended.  

  

I would like to ask two questions.  

  

First, if the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is allowed to continue, shall we arrive at a climate similar to the climate of six thousand years ago when the Sahara was wet?  

  

Second, if we could choose between the climate of today with a dry Sahara and the climate of six thousand years ago with a wet Sahara, should we prefer the climate of today?  

  

My second heresy answers yes to the first question and no to the second.  

  

It says that the warm climate of six thousand years ago with the wet Sahara is to be preferred, and that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may help to bring it back.  

  

I am not saying that this heresy is true.  

  

I am only saying that it will not do us any harm to think about it.   

The biosphere is the most complicated of all the things we humans have to deal with.  

  

The science of planetary ecology is still young and undeveloped.  

  

It is not surprising that honest and well-informed experts can disagree about facts.  

  

But beyond the disagreement about facts, there is another deeper disagreement about values.  

  

The disagreement about values may be described in an over-simplified way as a disagreement between naturalists and humanists.  

  

Naturalists believe that nature knows best. For them the highest value is to respect the natural order of things.  

  

Any gross human disruption of the natural environment is evil.  

  

Excessive burning of fossil fuels is evil.  

  

Changing nature’s desert, either the Sahara desert or the ocean desert, into a managed ecosystem where giraffes or tunafish may flourish, is likewise evil.  

  

Nature knows best, and anything we do to improve upon Nature will only bring trouble.   

The humanist ethic begins with the belief that humans are an essential part of nature.  

  

Through human minds the biosphere has acquired the capacity to steer its own evolution, and now we are in charge.  

  

Humans have the right and the duty to reconstruct nature so that humans and biosphere can both survive and prosper.  

  

For humanists, the highest value is harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.  

  

The greatest evils are poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, disease and hunger, all the conditions that deprive people of opportunities and limit their freedoms. The humanist ethic accepts an increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a small price to pay, if world-wide industrial development can alleviate the miseries of the poorer half of humanity.  

  

The humanist ethic accepts our responsibility to guide the evolution of the planet.   

The sharpest conflict between naturalist and humanist ethics arises in the regulation of genetic engineering.  

  

The naturalist ethic condemns genetically modified food-crops and all other genetic engineering projects that might upset the natural ecology.  

  

The humanist ethic looks forward to a time not far distant, when genetically engineered food-crops and energy-crops will bring wealth to poor people in tropical countries, and incidentally give us tools to control the growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  

  

Here I must confess my own bias.  

在这里，我必须坦白我的偏见。  

Since I was born and brought up in England, I spent my formative years in a land with great beauty and a rich ecology which is almost entirely man-made.  

由于我在英格兰出生和长大，我的成长岁月是在一个美丽且生态丰富、几乎完全由人造的土地上度过的。  

The natural ecology of England was uninterrupted and rather boring forest. Humans replaced the forest with an artificial landscape of grassland and moorland, fields and farms, with a much richer variety of plant and animal species.  

英格兰的自然生态曾是未受干扰且相对单调的森林。人类将森林替换为人工草地、荒地、田野和农场，植物和动物的种类变得更加丰富多样。  

Quite recently, only about a thousand years ago, we introduced rabbits, a non-native species which had a profound effect on the ecology.  

最近大约一千年前，我们引入了兔子，这种非本地物种对生态环境产生了深远的影响。  

Rabbits opened glades in the forest where flowering plants now flourish.  

兔子在森林中开辟了空地，现在花卉植物在这里茁壮成长。  

There is no wilderness in England, and yet there is plenty of room for wild-flowers and birds and butterflies as well as a high density of humans.  

英国没有真正的荒野，但仍然有足够的空间让野花、鸟儿和蝴蝶生长，同时也有很多人类居住。  

Perhaps that is why I am a humanist.   

也许这就是我为什么会成为人文主义者的原因。

To conclude this piece I come to my third and last heresy.  

为了总结这篇文章，我要谈谈我的第三个也是最后一个异端。  

My third heresy says that the United States has less than a century left of its turn as top nation.  

我的第三个异端观点是，美国作为世界顶尖国家的时间已经不到一个世纪了。  

Since the modern nation-state was invented around the year 1500, a succession of countries have taken turns at being top nation, first Spain, then France, Britain, America.  

自从现代民族国家在 1500 年左右诞生以来，西班牙、法国、英国和美国等国家轮流成为了世界顶尖国家。  

Each turn lasted about 150 years. Ours began in 1920, so it should end about 2070.  

每个周期大约持续 150 年。我们的周期始于 1920 年，因此预计将在 2070 年左右结束。  

The reason why each top nation’s turn comes to an end is that the top nation becomes over-extended, militarily, economically and politically.  

每个顶级国家的衰落原因在于，它们在军事、经济和政治上过度扩张。  

Greater and greater efforts are required to maintain the number one position.  

需要付出更多的努力才能保持第一的位置。  

Finally the over-extension becomes so extreme that the structure collapses.  

最终，过度扩展变得极其严重，导致结构崩溃。  

Already we can see in the American posture today some clear symptoms of over-extension.  

我们现在可以在美国的态度中看到一些明显的过度扩张迹象。  

Who will be the next top nation? China is the obvious candidate.  

下一个顶尖国家会是谁？显然，中国是最有力的候选者。  

After that it might be India or Brazil.  

接下来可能是印度或巴西。  

We should be asking ourselves, not how to live in an America-dominated world, but how to prepare for a world that is not America-dominated.  

我们应该问自己，不是如何在一个美国主导的世界中生活，而是如何为一个非美国主导的世界做好准备。  

That may be the most important problem for the next generation of Americans to solve.  

这可能是下一代美国人面临的最重要问题。  

How does a people that thinks of itself as number one yield gracefully to become number two?   

一个自认为是第一的民族，如何优雅地接受成为第二的现实？

I am telling the next generation of young students, who will still be alive in the second half of our century, that misfortunes are on the way.  

我在告诉下一代年轻学生，他们将在本世纪下半叶继续生活，厄运即将降临。  

Their precious Ph.D., or whichever degree they went through long years of hard work to acquire, may be worth less than they think.  

他们珍贵的博士学位，或他们经过多年辛勤努力获得的任何学位，可能并没有他们想象的那么有价值。  

Their specialized training may become obsolete.  

他们的专业培训可能会变得不再适用。  

They may find themselves over-qualified for the available jobs. They may be declared redundant.  

他们可能会发现自己对现有的工作资格过高，可能会被裁员。  

The country and the culture to which they belong may move far away from the mainstream.  

他们所处的国家和文化可能与主流大相径庭。  

But these misfortunes are also opportunities.  

但这些不幸也是一种机会。  

It is always open to them to join the heretics and find another way to make a living.  

他们始终可以选择加入异端，寻找其他谋生的方式。  

With or without a Ph.D., there are big and important problems for them to solve.   

不论是否拥有博士学位，他们面临着许多重要而复杂的问题需要解决。

I will not attempt to summarize the lessons that my readers should learn from these heresies.  

我不会试图总结我的读者应该从这些异端中获得的教训。  

The main lesson that I would like them to take home is that the long-range future is not predetermined.  

我希望他们能明白的主要教训是，未来并不是注定的。  

The future is in their hands.  

未来掌握在他们的手中。  

The rules of the world-historical game change from decade to decade in unpredictable ways.  

世界历史游戏的规则每十年都会以不可预测的方式发生变化。  

All our fashionable worries and all our prevailing dogmas will probably be obsolete in fifty years.  

我们所有的时尚忧虑和流行观念在五十年后可能都会变得过时。  

My heresies will probably also be obsolete.  

我的异端观点可能也会变得过时。  

It is up to them to find new heresies to guide our way to a more hopeful future.  

他们有责任寻找新的异端，以指引我们走向一个更加光明的未来。

**5\. Bad Advice to a Young Scientist  

给年轻科学家的错误建议**

Sixty years ago, when I was a young and arrogant physicist, I tried to predict the future of physics and biology.  

六十年前，当我还是一位年轻而自负的物理学家时，我试图预测物理学和生物学的未来。  

My prediction was an extreme example of wrongness, perhaps a world record in the category of wrong predictions.  

我的预测是一个极端错误的例子，可能在错误预测方面创下了世界纪录。  

I was giving advice about future employment to Francis Crick, the great biologist who died in 2005 after a long and brilliant career.  

我在给伟大的生物学家弗朗西斯·克里克提供关于未来就业的建议，他于 2005 年去世，度过了漫长而辉煌的职业生涯。  

He discovered, with Jim Watson, the double helix.  

他和吉姆·沃森一起发现了双螺旋的结构。  

They discovered the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, and thereby gave birth to the new science of molecular genetics.  

他们在 1953 年发现了 DNA 的双螺旋结构，这一发现开启了分子遗传学的新篇章。  

Eight years before that, in 1945, before World War 2 came to an end, I met Francis Crick for the first time.  

在 1945 年，也就是八年前，第二次世界大战结束之前，我第一次见到了弗朗西斯·克里克。  

He was in Fanum House, a dismal office building in London where the Royal Navy kept a staff of scientists.  

他在 Fanum House，一个位于伦敦的阴沉办公大楼，皇家海军在这里雇佣了一支科学家团队。  

Crick had been working for the Royal Navy for a long time and was depressed and discouraged.  

克里克在皇家海军工作了很久，感到非常沮丧和失望。  

He said he had missed his chance of ever amounting to anything as a scientist. Before World War 2, he had started a promising career as a physicist. But then the war hit him at the worst time, putting a stop to his work in physics and keeping him away from science for six years.  

他表示自己错过了作为科学家成就任何事情的机会。在第二次世界大战之前，他开始了有前途的物理学家职业生涯。但战争在最糟糕的时刻降临，终止了他的物理学工作，让他整整六年无法接触科学。  

The six best years of his life, squandered on naval intelligence, lost and gone forever.  

他生命中最美好的六年，白白浪费在海军情报上，已经失去，永远无法找回。  

Crick was good at naval intelligence, and did important work for the navy.  

克里克在海军情报方面很有才能，为海军做出了重要贡献。  

But military intelligence bears the same relation to intelligence as military music bears to music.  

军事情报与情报的关系，就像军事音乐与音乐的关系一样。  

After six years doing this kind of intelligence, it was far too late for Crick to start all over again as a student and relearn all the stuff he had forgotten.  

在从事这种情报工作六年后，克里克已经太晚了，无法重新作为学生开始，重新学习他所遗忘的所有知识。  

No wonder he was depressed. I came away from Fanum House thinking, “How sad. Such a bright chap.  

难怪他会感到沮丧。我离开法努姆大厦时心里想着：“真可惜，这么聪明的人。”  

If it hadn’t been for the war, he would probably have been quite a good scientist”.   

如果没有战争，他可能会成为一位相当出色的科学家。

A year later, I met Crick again. The war was over and he was much more cheerful.  

一年后，我再次见到了克里克。战争已经结束，他变得更加开朗。  

He said he was thinking of giving up physics and making a completely fresh start as a biologist. He said the most exciting science for the next twenty years would be in biology and not in physics.  

他表示他在考虑放弃物理学，重新开始作为生物学家。他认为未来二十年最令人兴奋的科学将是生物学，而不是物理学。  

I was then twenty-two years old and very sure of myself. I said, “No, you’re wrong.  

那时我二十二岁，对自己非常有信心。我说：“不，你错了。”  

In the long run biology will be more exciting, but not yet.  

从长远来看，生物学将会更加令人兴奋，但目前还不是时候。  

The next twenty years will still belong to physics.  

接下来的二十年依然属于物理学。  

If you switch to biology now, you will be too old to do the exciting stuff when biology finally takes off”.  

如果你现在转学到生物学，等生物学真正发展起来时，你可能会太老，无法参与那些激动人心的事情。  

Fortunately, he didn’t listen to me. He went to Cambridge and began thinking about DNA.  

幸运的是，他没有听我的建议，而是去了剑桥，开始研究 DNA。  

It took him only seven years to prove me wrong. The moral of this story is clear.  

他只用了七年就证明了我错了。这个故事的寓意很清楚。  

Even a smart twenty-two-year-old is not a reliable guide to the future of science.  

即使是一个聪明的二十二岁年轻人，也不能可靠地预测科学的未来。  

And the twenty-two-year-old has become even less reliable now that he is eighty-two.  

这位二十二岁的年轻人现在变得更加不可靠，因为他已经八十二岁了。

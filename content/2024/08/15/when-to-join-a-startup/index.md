When a startup is first founded, it is nothing but risk.  

当一家初创公司刚成立时，它充满了风险。  

Successfully building a company is the act of slowly eliminating that risk until you have created a reliable cash flow machine.  

成功建立一家公司就是逐步降低风险，直到你打造出一个稳定的现金流来源。

There are five types of risk:  

风险有五种类型：

1.  **Technology risk** - can we get the product to work?  
    
    技术风险 - 我们能让产品顺利运行吗？
    
2.  **Market risk** - can we build something people love?  
    
    市场风险 - 我们能否创造出人们喜爱的产品？
    
3.  **Scaling risk** - can we acquire lots of customers?  
    
    扩大风险 - 我们能否吸引大量客户？
    
4.  **Business model risk** - can we serve customers profitably?  
    
    商业模式风险 - 我们能否以盈利的方式为客户提供服务？
    
5.  **Defensibility risk** - can we maintain market share?  
    
    防御性风险 - 我们能否维持市场份额？
    

Remove all of them, and a business will become one of the most successful in the world, worth billions of dollars.  

如果去掉这些，生意将会成为全球最成功的之一，价值数十亿美元。  

 

YC’s motto is “make something people want”, which is a great objective for early stage startups.  

YC 的座右铭是“创造人们所需的东西”，这是早期创业公司一个非常好的目标。  

The longer term goal is more of a mouthful:  

更长期的目标更复杂一些：

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2Fcf8aed64-912d-473e-97f9-4872029ed1ae_1920x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf8aed64-912d-473e-97f9-4872029ed1ae_1920x900.png)

VCs think about risk all the time.  

风投们时刻关注风险。  

When a form of risk is removed, the expected value of a business goes up massively, so it’s lucrative to be the first money in after it’s clear that will happen.  

当一种风险被消除时，企业的预期价值会显著上升，因此在确认这一点后，率先投资将非常有利可图。

But not enough potential startup employees think about risk, even though it is the #1 thing that determines their economic outcome.  

但并不是所有潜在的创业员工都关注风险，尽管这是决定他们经济结果的首要因素。

Let’s look at each form of risk and the questions you can ask to understand if they’ve been solved.  

让我们来看看每种风险的形式，以及您可以提出的问题，以了解这些风险是否已经得到解决。  

Then we’ll explore how this typically plays out over a startup’s lifecycle, and what the good entry points are for those considering joining.  

然后我们将探讨这一过程在初创企业生命周期中的表现，以及对于考虑加入的人来说，哪些切入点比较合适。

Solving technology risk means answering the question **“Does this product actually do the thing we want it to?”**  

解决技术风险就是要回答“这个产品真的能实现我们的期望吗？”

Many people who have been in tech for less than ~20 years have never really had to think about this, because most companies were applying existing tech to new problems and customers.  

许多在科技行业工作不到 20 年的人从未真正思考过这个问题，因为大多数公司只是将现有技术应用于新的问题和客户。  

Basically every SaaS, marketplace, and e-commerce company jumps right to market risk.  

基本上每个 SaaS、市场和电子商务公司都直接关注市场风险。

But new waves of technology bring back tech risk.  

但新一轮技术浪潮带来了技术风险。  

With the rise of AI, many people are joining startups where technology risk is not actually solved, perhaps without even realizing it.  

随着人工智能的崛起，许多人加入了那些技术风险尚未解决的初创公司，可能甚至没有意识到这一点。  

Despite the hype, it remains to be seen to what extent and in what situations a model can actually replace a customer support agent, a developer, or an attorney.  

尽管有很多宣传，但仍需观察模型在多大程度上以及在什么情况下能够真正替代客户支持人员、开发者或律师。

Solving market risk is often called finding product-market fit, and it is the canonical thing that early stage founders are searching for.  

解决市场风险通常被称为寻找产品与市场的契合，这是早期创业者所追求的核心目标。

Understanding if a business has hit product market fit is classically fuzzy and sometimes gets summarized as “you’ll know it when you see it”.  

理解一个企业是否达到了产品市场契合度通常是模糊的，有时可以简单地说成“你看到的时候就会知道”。

However there are two things that are very strong indicators, especially when taken together:  

不过，有两件事情是非常明显的指标，尤其是当它们结合在一起时：

1.  **Do customers obviously love the product?** Do they talk about how much they love it with their friends?  
    
    顾客真的很喜欢这个产品吗？他们会和朋友分享他们的喜爱之情吗？  
    
    Would they be very upset if it was taken away?  
    
    如果把它拿走，他们会很生气吗？
    
2.  **Does the product have strong retention?** Specifically, if you draw a survival curve which charts the percentage of customers in each cohort that remain active over time, does it flatten out at some point?  
    
    这个产品的留存率高吗？具体来说，如果你绘制一条生存曲线，显示每个群体中保持活跃的客户百分比，是否会在某个时刻趋于平稳？  
    
    The fact that it flattens is more important than  
    
    它变平这一点比其他任何事情都更重要_where_ it flattens - some subset of customers must be finding value and sticking for a long time.  
    
    一些客户一定发现了价值并长期留存，这就是它的关键所在。
    

Product market fit often kicks off a wave of organic growth, but it won’t be sufficient to achieve real scale.  

产品市场契合往往会带来一波有机增长，但这并不足以达到真正的规模。  

The next phase is figuring out how to bring a product to many more people.  

下一步是找出如何将产品推广给更多人。

The thing to look for to assess whether scaling risk has been removed is, well, scale.  

评估扩展风险是否已消除的关键在于规模。  

But more precisely, two things:  

更准确地说，有两件事情：

1.  **Is there at least one channel of growth that is large and can grow reliably in the future?** There aren’t many options - in [this piece](https://review.firstround.com/drive-growth-by-picking-the-right-lane-a-customer-acquisition-playbook-for-consumer-startups/), Lenny and I wrote about how for consumer companies, there are basically only three (virality, paid marketing, and SEO).  
    
    是否至少有一个规模大且未来能够稳定增长的渠道？选择不多——在这篇文章中，Lenny 和我提到，对于消费类公司来说，基本上只有三种增长方式（病毒传播、付费营销和搜索引擎优化）。  
    
    For B2B businesses you can add sales.  
    
    对于 B2B 企业，您可以提升销售。  
    
    One of these channels needs to be absolutely cranking and have a path to continued growth.  
    
    这些渠道中的一个必须非常强劲，并且具备持续增长的潜力。
    
2.  **Is there a large enough market to continue to grow?** This can be hard to assess because the best startups expand their markets and grow into new ones.  
    
    是否有足够大的市场以便继续增长？这很难评估，因为最优秀的初创公司会拓展市场并进入新的领域。  
    
    But even once the business has produced meaningful scale (20, 50, 100 million in revenue) they should probably be less than 5% penetrated in their core market.  
    
    但即使业务达到了有意义的规模（如 2,000 万、5,000 万或 1 亿的收入），他们在核心市场的渗透率可能仍然不足 5%。
    

Solving all of the previous forms of risk is considerably easier if you’re selling dollars for 90 cents.  

如果你以 90 美分的价格出售美元，解决所有之前的风险就会容易得多。  

The next big risk is figuring out how to actually make money selling something people love.  

下一个重大风险是如何真正通过销售人们喜爱的产品来获利。

The best two questions to assess the potential for good economics are:  

评估经济潜力的两个最佳问题是：

1.  **Does the business have sufficiently low payback periods on customer acquisition spend?** Good paybacks are usually about 6 months for B2C companies and 12-18 months for B2B.  
    
    这个企业在客户获取支出方面的回报期是否足够短？对于 B2C 公司，理想的回报期通常是 6 个月，而对于 B2B 公司则是 12 到 18 个月。
    
2.  **Does the business have a healthy contribution margin?** Contribution margin is the amount left after you take out all of costs that can be attributed to a transaction, like COGS and marketing.  
    
    这个企业的贡献利润是否健康？贡献利润是指在扣除所有与交易相关的成本后所剩的金额，例如销售成本和市场营销费用。  
    
    These vary widely but for technology businesses should generally be north of 50% of revenue.  
    
    这些差异很大，但对于科技企业来说，收入通常应该在 50%以上。
    

Companies that solve for the other forms of risk will inevitably attract a lot of competition.  

解决其他风险类型的公司必然会吸引大量竞争。  

Some businesses will hold up well to this, and others will get locked into a zero sum battle that destroys their margins.  

一些企业在这种情况下会表现得很好，而另一些企业则会陷入一场摧毁其利润的零和竞争。  

 

The difference is defensibility, and the best framework I’ve found for understanding this is Hamilton Helmer’s 7 Powers.  

区别在于防御能力，而我认为理解这一点的最佳框架是汉密尔顿·赫尔默的《七种力量》。  

It outlines the way that businesses can continue to earn differential returns, i.e. protect their position.  

它阐述了企业如何持续获得差异化收益，以保护自身的市场地位。

It’s worth just reading his book.  

读一读他的书是很有价值的。  

However one shortcut: most defensibility for new technology companies derives from one of three things:  

不过，有一个捷径：大多数新技术公司的竞争优势主要源于以下三种因素之一：

1.  Network effects: **does the product get more valuable as more customers use it?**  
    
    网络效应：随着客户数量的增加，产品的价值是否会提升？
    
2.  Scale economies: **does the cost to serve customers get significantly lower as the business gets larger?**  
    
    规模经济：随着企业规模的扩大，服务客户的成本是否会显著降低？
    
3.  Switching costs: **once they have started using the product, is it hard for customers to switch to a similar one?**  
    
    切换成本：一旦客户开始使用该产品，转用类似产品是否很困难？
    

Solving for these risks is of course less linear than I’ve presented here.  

解决这些风险显然比我在这里所展示的要简单得多linear。  

It’s not always clear if a form of risk has actually been removed, and companies can bounce between stages.  

风险是否真的被消除并不总是明确，公司可能在各个阶段之间反复徘徊。

In particular, there is often a circular relationship between scaling and business model risk.  

特别是，规模与商业模式风险之间常常存在相互影响的关系。  

Getting bigger requires pushing into new channels and new customer segments, both of which put more pressure on economics, so companies must vacillate between expanding, figuring out economics, and expanding again.  

扩大规模需要开拓新的渠道和客户群体，这会给经济带来更大压力，因此公司必须在扩张、理清经济状况和再次扩张之间反复权衡。  

 

A typical journey looks something like this:  

一次典型的旅行大致是这样的：

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F5fcf6815-caf2-4dcb-a97f-b9595f0aeb42_1920x1200.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcf6815-caf2-4dcb-a97f-b9595f0aeb42_1920x1200.png)

Funding rounds map to these stages of risk only very roughly, and that is kind of the point: it’s more important to focus on risk than stage.  

融资轮次与这些风险阶段的对应关系非常粗略，这正是关键所在：关注风险比关注阶段更为重要。  

Companies often get funded before risk has actually been removed.  

公司往往在风险尚未完全消除之前就获得融资。  

This is especially true in hype cycles like the one we’re going through with AI right now, which can create particularly bad outcomes for employees.  

这在我们当前经历的人工智能热潮中尤其明显，这可能会给员工带来非常不利的后果。

The most basic principle is to try to do the same thing VCs do: invest (join) as soon as you can tell a major risk will been removed, before many other people have figured it out.  

最基本的原则是尽早投资（加入），在你能判断出一个主要风险将被消除之前，尽量做到风险投资者所做的事情，而不是等到很多人都意识到这一点。  

This is of course not particularly easy to do, but even considering risk gives job seekers a big advantage.  

这当然不是特别容易做到，但即使考虑风险，求职者也能获得很大的优势。

It’s common for candidates to flock to a startup that recently got a big new funding round and big new valuation.  

候选人通常会蜂拥而至那些刚获得大额融资和高估值的初创公司。  

This is exactly the kind of thing to avoid, because the upside was just built into the value of your equity grant.  

这正是需要避免的情况，因为你的股权授予的价值中已经包含了潜在的收益。

Beyond this basic principle, there are two entry points that are often good, and one that is often dangerous.  

除了这个基本原则，还有两个通常是不错的切入点，而一个则常常是危险的。

**One very good time to join a startup is immediately after they have solved market risk (i.e. found product market fit).** Most companies that achieve product market fit will not ultimately build a sustainable business.  

加入初创公司的一个理想时机是他们刚刚解决了市场风险（即找到了产品与市场的契合）。大多数实现产品市场契合的公司最终并不会建立起可持续的业务。  

However most of them  

不过大多数人_will_ go on to grow dramatically, which is great for your career and could produce a meaningful economic outcome.  

这将会大幅增长，对你的职业发展非常有利，并可能带来显著的经济效益。  

And you will almost certainly learn a lot in the process.  

你在这个过程中肯定会学到很多。

**The other great time to join is during the messy dance between scaling and business model risk.** These businesses are actively breaking out, and a higher percentage of them are on their way to an IPO or other meaningful exit.  

另一个加入的好时机是在扩展与商业模式风险之间的复杂阶段。这些企业正在积极发展，其中更高比例的企业正朝着首次公开募股或其他重要的退出方式迈进。

It is an especially good time to join if the company has recently made a lot of progress on one of the forms of risk, such as tapping into a new growth channel or making improvements to their unit economics.  

如果公司最近在某种风险方面取得了显著进展，比如开拓新的增长渠道或改善单位经济，那么现在加入是一个特别好的时机。  

One or both of these should be leading to  

这两个中的一个或两个应该是引导到_rapidly expanding contribution profit_.  

快速增长的贡献利润。

**A typically bad point to join a startup is before market risk is solved, if you’re not a founder.** You’re simply taking on almost as much risk as the founders, with much less equity in return.  

在市场风险尚未解决之前，加入初创公司通常是一个不好的时机，尤其是如果你不是创始人。你所承担的风险几乎与创始人相当，但获得的股权却少得多。

As the table below shows, employees #1-5 usually get around 50 bps of equity, which is at least an order of magnitude less than founders.  

如下表所示，员工#1-5 通常获得大约 50 个基点的股权，这至少比创始人少了一个数量级。  

Are the chances that the company gets to a meaningful outcome also an order of magnitude better?  

这家公司获得有意义结果的机会是否也大大提高了？  

Occasionally, for example in the case of repeat founders who know their market exceptionally well.  

偶尔，比如在那些对市场非常了解的重复创始人身上。  

But not usually.   

但通常不是这样。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F99d28d32-dbd0-4bbe-aee7-77539a41e299_1536x1536.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99d28d32-dbd0-4bbe-aee7-77539a41e299_1536x1536.png)

It might still be a good trade for some people - working on early stage businesses is very fun if you’re wired for it, and it may be a mission you just have to be a part of.  

对于某些人来说，这仍然可能是一个不错的选择——如果你适合的话，参与早期阶段的企业工作非常有趣，这可能是你必须参与的使命。  

But in purely risk vs.  

但在纯粹的风险与收益之间。  

reward terms, it’s usually better to wait until the company has found product market fit.  

奖励条款通常建议等到公司找到产品与市场的契合点后再行动。

The most important lesson of all: _be intentional about learning to assess risk._  

最重要的教训是：要有意识地学习如何评估风险。

Early in a career, that often means working at at least one company that is sufficiently de-risked and sufficiently well run so that you can see what “good” looks like.  

在职业生涯的早期，这通常意味着你需要在至少一家公司工作，这家公司足够稳健且管理良好，让你能够看到什么是“优秀”。  

This will help you get comfortable accepting more risk later on.  

这将帮助你在未来更自信地接受更多风险。

Later in a career, it means building enough expertise that you know how to spot breakthroughs in risk before the rest of the market can.  

在职业生涯的后期，这意味着积累足够的专业知识，以便在市场其他人之前发现风险中的突破。  

That might mean specializing in a stage (such as helping companies scale after they achieve product market fit) or specializing in an industry (such as spending so much time with marketplaces that you know what it looks like as they transition through stages).  

这可能意味着专注于某个阶段（比如帮助公司在实现产品市场契合后进行扩展）或专注于某个行业（例如花费大量时间与市场合作，以至于你了解它们在不同阶段过渡时的情况）。

Ultimately, the assessment of risk is just one part of a broader framework for [how to choose a startup](https://www.danhock.co/p/how-to-choose-a-startup).  

最终，风险评估只是选择初创企业的一个更广泛框架中的一部分。  

But if you start thinking a little more about risk and asking some of the questions above as you’re searching, you’re likely to make better decisions.  

但如果你在思考风险时多问一些上述问题，你可能会做出更明智的决策。

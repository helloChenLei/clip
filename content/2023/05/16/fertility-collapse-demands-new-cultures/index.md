Birth rates are falling much faster than many dominant narratives imply. The global fertility rate for all of Latin America and the Caribbean [fell below](https://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/latin-america-and-caribbean-reach-maximum-population-levels-2058#:~:text=The%20slowdown%20in%20population%20growth,region%2C%20carried%20out%20by%20the) the replacement rate of 2.1 babies per woman in 2019. [India](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/fertility-rate) will achieve that status in 2024. China is expected to be at [half](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3150699/chinas-population-could-halve-within-next-45-years-new-study) its current population by 2066. First-generation immigrants to the US [fell below](https://cis.org/Report/Fertility-Among-Immigrants-and-NativeBorn-Americans) the replacement rate in 2019. Already, 115 countries representing about half the world’s population are beneath replacement, and by the end of the century nearly every country in Africa is projected to have a rapidly declining population.  

出生率的下降速度比许多主流说法所暗示的要快得多。 2019 年，整个拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的全球生育率低于每名妇女生育 2.1 个婴儿的更替率。印度将在 2024 年达到这一水平。预计到 2066 年，中国的人口将减少到目前人口的一半。第一代移民2019 年，美国的人口低于替代率。占世界人口一半左右的 115 个国家已经低于替代率，到本世纪末，预计非洲几乎每个国家的人口都将迅速下降。

Even strict religious fundamentalism does not protect against this drop. From the 1980s to the 2010s, the average Iranian woman shifted from having 6.5 to just 2.5 children, and [as of 2021 it was 1.6](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/461656/Iran-s-fertility-rate-alarmingly-low). This drop in fertility [beat](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-161-irans-contested-demographic?fbclid=IwAR02R-9s7xj0VDG7h9fZk59bhP8yTyKzJqPzTbq6EnU6RAegWbx7Z6zXOtQ) China’s one-child policy. In the U.S., meanwhile, the Mormon population in Utah fell to [almost below](https://eternalanglo.com/mormon-fertility-6-indicators) replacement in 2021. This is not a “canary in the coal mine” moment.  

We’ve reached the metaphorical point at which the miners’ skin is sloughing off—all while many claim this dramatic drop is a “minor inconvenience” or even a welcome development.  

即使是严格的宗教原教旨主义也无法防止这种下降。从 1980 年代到 2010 年代，伊朗女性的平均生育率从 6.5 个增加到 2.5 个，到 2021 年为 1.6 个。生育率的下降击败了中国的独生子女政策。与此同时，在美国，犹他州的摩门教人口在 2021 年下降到几乎低于更替人口。这不是“煤矿中的金丝雀”时刻。我们已经达到了矿工皮肤脱落的隐喻点——尽管许多人声称这种急剧下降是“轻微的不便”，甚至是一个受欢迎的发展。

People underestimate how quickly this effect will be felt. South Korea currently has a total fertility rate of [0.81](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2022/02/281_324402.html). For every 100 South Korean great-grandparents, there will be 6.6 great-grandkids. At the 0.7 fertility rate predicted in South Korea by 2024, that amounts to 4.3 great-grandkids.  

It’s as if we knew a disease would kill 94 percent of South Koreans in the next century.  

人们低估了这种影响会以多快的速度被感受到。韩国目前的总生育率为0.81。每100个韩国曾祖父母，就会有6.6个曾孙。按照韩国到 2024 年预测的 0.7 生育率，这相当于 4.3 个曾孙。就好像我们知道一种疾病会在下个世纪杀死 94% 的韩国人。

People underrate how quickly this can become serious, once it is felt. As recently as the mid-1990s, South Korea had a birth rate of 1.7, which is close to the U.S.’s present rate.  

A fertility collapse takes around thirty years before it causes a population collapse, and once that happens, the collapse is inevitable.  

If 70 percent of a nation’s population is over age 50, and even though many of those people have almost half their lifespan left they are not going to be having any more kids.  

一旦感觉到这种情况，人们低估了它变得严重的速度。就在 20 世纪 90 年代中期，韩国的出生率为 1.7，接近美国目前的水平。生育率崩溃大约需要 30 年时间才会导致人口崩溃，而一旦发生这种情况，崩溃就不可避免。如果一个国家 70% 的人口年龄超过 50 岁，即使其中许多人的寿命还剩下将近一半，他们也不会再要孩子了。

Across the world, we see a similar phenomenon: countries explode in population as access to modern wealth expands, then drop off and begin to collapse as incomes rise and lifestyle modernization sets in.  

While many countries have yet to reach this crescendo, most are well on their way. But why is this happening?  

在世界各地，我们看到了一个类似的现象：随着获得现代财富的机会的扩大，国家人口激增，然后随着收入增加和生活方式现代化的开始而下降并开始崩溃。虽然许多国家尚未达到这种高潮，但大多数国家都很好在途中。但是为什么会这样呢？

Consider your personal social group. If you are like most in the developed world, around a third of your peers will have no kids and about a third will have two kids.  

If that group is to hover just above the repopulation rate, the final third must have over four kids each.  

考虑你的个人社交群体。如果你和发达国家的大多数人一样，大约三分之一的同龄人没有孩子，大约三分之一的人有两个孩子。如果该组要徘徊在人口再增加率之上，那么最后三分之一必须每个人有四个以上的孩子。

People misframe the question of stable birth rates when they ask “Why is everyone in my community not having two kids?” We already know that in the modern world, broken matchmaking and individual choice will drive a large portion of people to forego parenthood entirely.  

As such, if fertility in your community is to stay sustainable, it is up to a certain number of those who _do_ have kids to have _quite a few kids_. Modern societies should not be asking: “Why isn’t everyone having kids?” but rather: “Why aren’t many in my community having five to seven kids?”  

当人们问“为什么我们社区中的每个人都不生两个孩子？”时，人们错误地理解了稳定出生率的问题。我们已经知道，在现代世界中，破裂的婚介和个人选择将驱使很大一部分人完全放弃为人父母的身份。因此，如果您所在社区的生育率要保持可持续，那么一定数量的有孩子的人就可以生很多孩子。现代社会不应该问：“为什么不是每个人都生孩子？”而是：“为什么我的社区中没有很多人有五到七个孩子？”

When the question is reframed, the answer is still obvious, but subtle in its implications. Purely hedonic returns from having more kids diminish significantly after two kids.  

Even when the financial constraints associated with child-rearing are completely lifted, there are only three reasons a person has well over two kids: if every child they have adds significantly to the family’s economic prospects; if the family lacks the education necessary to use birth control effectively or is in a situation where birth control is not an option; or if there is some cultural externality motivating them to have lots of kids.  

当问题被重新设计时，答案仍然是显而易见的，但其含义却很微妙。在两个孩子之后，更多孩子带来的纯粹享乐回报会显着减少。即使完全解除与抚养孩子相关的经济限制，一个人拥有两个以上的孩子也只有三个原因：如果家庭缺乏有效使用节育措施的必要教育，或者处于无法选择节育措施的情况下；或者是否存在某种文化外部性促使他们生很多孩子。

While economic gain has historically been a driver of high birth rates, the global decline in child labor and household businesses with modernization has removed this factor.  

Lack of access to birth control is also increasingly no longer a factor with a massive worldwide increase in female education, sex education, and birth control availability.  

This is favorable news in many ways, but it also means this future of widespread prosperity, female education, and modernization is inherently unstable unless prosperous egalitarian societies can maintain or increase their populations through sustainable birth rates.  

虽然经济收益历来是高出生率的驱动因素，但随着现代化的发展，全球童工和家庭企业的减少消除了这一因素。随着全球女性教育、性教育和节育措施的普及，无法获得节育措施也越来越不再是一个因素。这在很多方面都是好消息，但这也意味着广泛繁荣、女性教育和现代化的未来本质上是不稳定的，除非繁荣的平等社会能够通过可持续的出生率维持或增加人口。

Many people have the intuition that when a population crashes, the amount of resources left to go around will increase on a per-person basis and this boost in individual prosperity will create a new homeostasis at which populations reach a sustainable, more-or-less constant level, or even start to grow.  

This intuition is wrong on three fronts.   

许多人的直觉是，当人口崩溃时，人均剩余资源量将增加，而个人繁荣的这种提升将创造一种新的体内平衡，使人口达到可持续的、或多或少的恒定水平，甚至开始增长。这种直觉在三个方面是错误的。

First, we have seen what happens to nations later on the “fertility collapse timeline” than ours like South Korea.  

Decline has not tapered off in any of the later-stage demographic collapse nations. If there is an organic floor on fertility collapse, it is so low as to be irrelevant.  

首先，我们已经看到在“生育率崩溃时间表”上晚于韩国等国家的情况。在任何处于后期人口崩溃阶段的国家，下降趋势都没有减弱。如果生育率崩溃有一个有机的底线，那么它太低以至于无关紧要。

Second, increasing individual wealth is associated with decreases in birth rate.  

While birth rates eventually recover at extreme levels of wealth, they only hit above-repopulation levels when a family is earning between $500,000 to $1 million dollars a year.  

In the same way that the birth rate begins to crash around an income of $5,000 a year, presumably correlated with an individual’s participation in the modern economy, something similar is happening at the $500,000 mark.  

Around $500,000 a year may be the income level at which the average person is no longer compelled to be involved in the modern pattern of labor mobilization; they don’t have to work or can at least work flexibly.  

But this is a relative effect, not absolute, so rising resources overall won’t help.  

其次，个人财富的增加与出生率的下降有关。虽然出生率最终会在极端财富水平下恢复，但只有当一个家庭年收入在 50 万至 100 万美元之间时，他们才会达到人口再增加水平以上。就像出生率在年收入 5,000 美元附近开始暴跌一样，大概与个人对现代经济的参与有关，类似的事情也在 500,000 美元大关发生。大约每年 50 万美元可能是普通人不再被迫参与现代劳动力动员模式的收入水平；他们不必工作，或者至少可以灵活地工作。但这是相对的影响，不是绝对的，因此整体上增加资源无济于事。

Third, given how much we have leveraged our land, companies, cities, states, and nations, decreasing populations may even dramatically reduce wealth and trigger a cascade of defaults.  

We saw this situation play out in Detroit, which lost 40 percent of its population over the last 60 years.  

Even if people can buy a house for a thousand dollars when the population collapses, those houses will have partially caved-in roofs, be stripped of wiring, and be devoid of power and running water.  

Our entire civilization has been built like a Ponzi scheme that requires constant growth. That scheme will eventually collapse.  

第三，考虑到我们对土地、公司、城市、州和国家的杠杆作用有多大，人口减少甚至可能会大幅减少财富并引发一连串的违约。我们在底特律看到了这种情况，它在过去 60 年里失去了 40% 的人口。即使人们在人口崩溃时可以花一千美元买一套房子，这些房子的屋顶也会部分塌陷，电线会被剥掉，而且没有电和自来水。我们的整个文明就像一个需要不断增长的庞氏骗局。该计划最终将崩溃。

In fact, an infrastructure collapse is a near constant of any location that has a dropping population.  

The way we have laid out roads, power, or water infrastructure, for example, is not easily partitioned.  

If you build out infrastructure in a city to deliver water to a million people and its population drops to half a million, it still costs almost as much to maintain as it did before, with half the tax base and half the benefit.  

事实上，基础设施崩溃几乎是人口下降的任何地方的常态。例如，我们铺设道路、电力或供水基础设施的方式不容易分割。如果你在一个城市建设基础设施为一百万人供水，而它的人口下降到五十万，它的维护成本仍然几乎和以前一样多，税基和收益减半。

### **False Solutions**

Some imagine that AI or some other technological breakthrough can act as a deus ex machina to ameliorate the economic challenges of population decline by substituting for human workers in the economy.  

But even in the optimistic case this will not solve all of it, and it may cause its own very serious problems. At the very least, AI will only help the supply side of the incoming economic disaster because it does not consume in the same way humans do.  

AI wealth may not help at all with infrastructural maintenance, or may even cause it to be even more neglected as it removes the economic imperative to solve coordination problems faced by human workers.   

一些人认为，人工智能或其他一些技术突破可以充当机器神，通过取代经济中的人类工人来缓解人口下降带来的经济挑战。但即使在乐观的情况下，这也不会解决所有问题，而且可能会导致其自身出现非常严重的问题。至少，人工智能只会帮助即将到来的经济灾难的供应方，因为它不像人类那样消费。人工智能财富可能对基础设施维护毫无帮助，甚至可能导致它更加被忽视，因为它消除了解决人类工人面临的协调问题的经济必要性。

The fallout from demographic collapse extends beyond crumbling infrastructure, failed pension funds, unstable governments, and faltering financial markets.  

Consider that almost everything about the human sociological profile has a genetic component, ranging from prosociality to altruism and voting patterns.  

人口崩溃的后果不仅限于摇摇欲坠的基础设施、失败的养老基金、不稳定的政府和步履蹒跚的金融市场。考虑到几乎所有关于人类社会学特征的东西都有遗传成分，从亲社会到利他主义和投票模式。

Our economy is structured in a manner that organically identifies and maximally utilizes talent to create short-term marginal productivity.  

The system differentially sorts for the most potentially productive among us, and then offers them money and status to forgo other life activities that don’t create immediate productivity.  

我们的经济结构以有机识别和最大限度地利用人才来创造短期边际生产力的方式构建。该系统对我们中最具生产力的人进行差异化分类，然后为他们提供金钱和地位，以放弃其他不会立即产生生产力的生活活动。

There is little that draws a person away from immediate economic productivity more than a social lifestyle compatible with good matchmaking, strong family ties, and child rearing.  

No one gets financially rewarded in our current system by structuring cities in a way that invites the creation of large families.  

In fact, many will be punished if this pressure exists by local companies having less worker time, for example.  

For this reason, the centers of productivity in a modernized economy will intrinsically be suboptimal environments for raising large families.  

没有什么比与良好的婚介、牢固的家庭关系和抚养子女相容的社会生活方式更能使人远离直接的经济生产力了。在我们当前的系统中，没有人通过以邀请创建大家庭的方式构建城市来获得经济回报。事实上，如果存在这种压力，例如工人时间较少的本地公司，许多人将受到惩罚。出于这个原因，现代化经济中的生产力中心本质上将不是养育大家庭的最佳环境。

Those who propose to “solve demographic collapse with immigration” are implicitly endorsing the creation of a toxic situation where the developed world’s economy is reliant on Africa staying poor.  

This is because if high-birth-rate nations are allowed to continue on their path to development, they, too, will fall below the repopulation rate.  

Worse still, because the system we have built differentially feasts on the most productive and prosocial people and culturally castrates them, it unsustainably consumes human capital.  

那些提议“通过移民解决人口崩溃问题”的人含蓄地赞同创造一种有毒的局面，即发达国家的经济依赖于非洲的持续贫困。这是因为如果允许高出生率国家继续其发展道路，它们也将低于人口再增长率。更糟糕的是，由于我们建立的系统以差异化方式盛宴最具生产力和最亲社会的人，并在文化上阉割他们，它不可持续地消耗人力资本。

If you differentially kill friendly elephants with large tusks, the remaining elephants will have smaller tusks and exhibit more aggressive behavior. The same is true for humans.  

The sociological profile most amenable to what we think of as modern cosmopolitan society—one that is open-minded, pluralistic, technophilic, and egalitarian—is being aggressively deleted from the world’s population.  

Given the differential birth rates and the heritability of certain traits, we may see a standard deviation shift in political attitudes towards theocratic dictatorialism within the next 75 years or so.  

如果你以不同的方式杀死长着大象牙的友好大象，剩下的大象将有更小的象牙并表现出更具攻击性的行为。人类也是如此。最适合我们所认为的现代世界主义社会的社会学特征——一个思想开放、多元化、技术狂热和平等主义的社会——正在被积极地从世界人口中删除。鉴于不同的出生率和某些特征的遗传能力，我们可能会在未来 75 年左右的时间内看到对神权独裁主义的政治态度发生标准偏差转变。

### **Cultures That Last 持续的文化**

The demographic problem seems very dark, but there is a silver lining that comes down to the final reason people have more than two kids: The presence of a cultural motivator.  

人口问题似乎非常黑暗，但有一线希望归结为人们拥有两个以上孩子的最终原因：文化动机的存在。

Suppose we manage to build a culture that is pronatalist, technophilic, productive, and pluralistic but immune to the siren call of the talent beast.  

Suppose we, the authors, have eight kids and each of them has eight kids, for example.  

If this could be kept up for eleven generations, we would have more descendants than people currently alive on Earth and would have set the tone for the future of human civilization.  

This example is perhaps unrealistic and even undesirable, but it illustrates that a relatively small seed can have a big effect.  

假设我们设法建立了一种文化，这种文化是生育主义的、技术狂热的、富有成效的和多元化的，但不受人才野兽的警笛声的影响。例如，假设我们，作者，有八个孩子，他们每个人都有八个孩子。如果这种情况能够持续十一代，我们的后代数量将超过地球上现存的人口数量，并为人类文明的未来定下基调。这个例子可能不切实际，甚至是不可取的，但它说明了一个相对较小的种子可以产生很大的影响。

Cultural mass extinction is avoidable if just a handful of families from each culture manage to make their cultures intergenerationally durable.  

Their cultures would be made durable in the sense that they have children above the repopulation rate, and they raise these children in a way that convinces enough of them to also have many children, and so on.  

如果每种文化中只有少数家庭能够使他们的文化代代相传，那么文化大灭绝是可以避免的。他们的文化将变得持久，因为他们的孩子超过人口再增加率，他们抚养这些孩子的方式足以说服他们也有很多孩子，等等。

But a future populated only by the descendants of very few family cultures is a failure scenario, as it would be an incredibly homogeneous world prone to fragility.  

The ideal is a future in which as many cultures as possible—both old and new—cooperate and compete in a diverse cultural ecosystem, sharpening each other in the process.  

但是，未来只有极少数家庭文化的后代居住是一个失败的场景，因为这将是一个非常容易变得脆弱的同质世界。理想的未来是，尽可能多的文化——包括新旧文化——在多元化的文化生态系统中合作和竞争，并在此过程中相互促进。

Part of the reason many are averse to thinking about these problems is that they are associated with the high-modernist approach of twentieth-century eugenics, which targeted centrally determined “desirable” and “undesirable” traits.  

A focus on creating a diversity of sustainable cultures is a very different proposition and doesn’t share the same failure modes.  

The key problem is not controlling fertility and diversity, but making room for it and allowing it, which both the current modern system and twentieth-century eugenics do not.  

许多人不愿思考这些问题的部分原因是，它们与 20 世纪优生学的高度现代主义方法有关，后者针对的是集中确定的“理想”和“不良”特征。专注于创造可持续文化的多样性是一个非常不同的命题，并且没有相同的失败模式。关键问题不是控制生育率和多样性，而是为它腾出空间并允许它，而当前的现代制度和 20 世纪的优生学都没有做到这一点。

Noticing that genetic traits affect behavior isn’t the problem.  

The problem is allowing centralized systems to try to control and optimize genetic outcomes, which could only lead to homogenization and centralized pathology.  

What’s needed is the opposite of centralized valuation—an expansion of choice at the family level that supports a diversity of cultures, desirable societies, and the people that will live in them.  

注意到遗传特征影响行为不是问题。问题是允许集中式系统试图控制和优化遗传结果，这只会导致同质化和集中病理。我们需要的是与集中式估值相反——在家庭层面扩大选择范围，支持文化多样性、理想社会以及将生活在其中的人们。

Ensuring the future of our species is dramatically easier than one might imagine.  

We live in a world in which technophilic cultures are being aggressively deleted, and in which the most productive and meritocratic people are being functionally castrated.  

This means that even a small group of technophilic, meritocratic families with high birth rates can become the new norm within a few generations.  

The key challenge for these new cultures will be to maintain their social defenses against the alluring pathologies of the failing modern social system.  

确保我们物种的未来比人们想象的要容易得多。我们生活在一个技术文化被积极删除的世界，最有生产力和精英管理的人在功能上被阉割。这意味着，即使是一小群崇尚技术、高出生率的精英家庭，也能在几代人之内成为新常态。这些新文化面临的主要挑战将是维持他们的社会防御，以抵御失败的现代社会制度的诱人病态。

But the great thing about living in a world of dying systems is that you are uniquely well-positioned to replace suboptimal systems with something superior.  

New growth takes root best in the decay of its predecessors.  

For most of the past, if you wanted to create a better future, you had to rally the troops and take someone else’s land or destroy existing systems and replace them.  

In a dying world, all you have to do is create something intergenerationally durable.  

但是，生活在一个系统垂死的世界中的好处在于，您处于独特的有利位置，可以用更优的系统替换次优系统。新的增长最好地扎根于其前身的衰败中。在过去的大部分时间里，如果你想创造一个更美好的未来，你必须集结军队并夺取别人的土地或摧毁现有系统并取代它们。在一个垂死的世界里，你所要做的就是创造一些代际持久的东西。

A century ago, Japan launched a brutal war in hopes that its culture and people would come to dominate China and Korea.  

Given that all three countries currently have collapsing populations, _any_ of the three could easily dominate their region in just a few generations if they could merely motivate a high or even just stable birth rate within some segment of their population.  

Given that for every hundred South Koreans there will be 4.3 great-grandchildren at their 0.7 fertility rate, this is very doable.  

Low-fertility-rate nations will have a very hard time holding up against any culturally sustainable neighbors after a 95 percent population collapse.  

一个世纪前，日本发动了一场残酷的战争，希望其文化和人民能够主宰中国和朝鲜。鉴于这三个国家目前的人口都在减少，如果这三个国家中的任何一个国家都能在其人口的某些部分中激发高出生率甚至稳定的出生率，那么这三个国家中的任何一个都可以在短短几代人的时间内轻松统治他们的地区。鉴于每 100 名韩国人将有 4.3 个曾孙，生育率为 0.7，这是非常可行的。在人口锐减 95% 之后，低生育率国家将很难与任何文化可持续的邻国抗衡。

Humanity can be thought of as an evolving hardware in the form of our biology and genetically coded predilections, and an evolving software in the form of our religion and culture.  

Historically speaking, conversions are fairly rare, so most religions and cultures survived by helping their hosts survive and reproduce.  

人类可以被认为是一种以我们的生物学和基因编码的偏好形式出现的不断发展的硬件，以及一种以我们的宗教和文化形式出现的不断发展的软件。从历史上看，conversion依的情况相当罕见，因此大多数宗教和文化都是通过帮助其宿主生存和繁衍而幸存下来的。

We spent the last century or so ripping this cultural lattice from our psyche and replacing it with the jury-rigged modern economic culture.  

These systems we ripped out were not an afterthought; humanity co-evolved with them.  

Should we be so shocked that birth rates plummeted and mental health problems skyrocketed when we ripped out a component our brains evolved to work with?  

Should we be so surprised that as cultural orphans with faded cultural memory, we search for meaning in the half-baked ideologies of Goop, Effective Altruism, and other modern guru-spheres?  

在上个世纪左右的时间里，我们从我们的心灵中撕裂了这种文化格子，并用陪审团操纵的现代经济文化取而代之。我们淘汰的这些系统不是事后才想到的；人类与他们共同进化。当我们撕掉大脑进化的一个组成部分时，我们是否应该对出生率直线下降和心理健康问题激增感到震惊？我们是否应该感到惊讶，作为文化记忆褪色的文化孤儿，我们在 Goop、有效利他主义和其他现代大师领域的半生不熟的意识形态中寻找意义？

We don’t need to tread the exact steps of our ancestors to get back to a sustainable culture.  

Little of what came before is compatible with an industrially advanced civilization, nor did it prove itself able to hold up against the pathologies of modern culture.  

We also don’t need to wait for someone to tell us what is true.  

The terrifying and exciting nature of the times is that each of us has the chance to define the future of our species through the cultures we create for our families, stitching together modern philosophy, the remaining shreds of past traditions, and our own innovations.  

我们不需要重蹈祖先的覆辙来回归可持续发展的文化。之前出现的东西很少与工业先进的文明相容，也没有证明自己能够抵御现代文化的病态。我们也不需要等待别人告诉我们什么是真实的。这个时代既可怕又令人兴奋的本质是，我们每个人都有机会通过我们为家庭创造的文化来定义我们物种的未来，将现代哲学、过去传统的残余碎片和我们自己的创新结合在一起。

Mainstream culture does not work: it does not motivate sustainable birth rates.  

In order to make the leap to a culture that does, many of us must create new cultures or significantly fortify those we inherited.  

Those who will throw their chips in with this massive cultural and demographic experiment by consciously creating a family, and then raising it in an intergenerationally durable culture, will shape the future of our species.  

Is this an easy feat? No. But what makes this endeavor so appealing and hopeful is that it is within nearly everyone’s reach, so long as they’re willing to try.  

The future belongs to those who show up.  

主流文化不起作用：它不会促进可持续的出生率。为了飞跃到一种文化，我们中的许多人必须创造新的文化或显着强化我们继承的文化。那些愿意通过有意识地建立一个家庭，然后在代际持久的文化中养育它来参与这一大规模文化和人口实验的人，将塑造我们物种的未来。这是一件容易的事吗？不，但是让这项努力如此吸引人和充满希望的是，只要他们愿意尝试，几乎每个人都可以做到。未来属于那些出现的人。

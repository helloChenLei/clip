    This shows the mean estimate of annual influenza mortality between 2002–2011, excluding the 2009 “Swine flu” pandemic influenza season. You can find estimated numbers for world regions in Table 2 of the paper. Rates for other age groups can be found here: [https://www.nivel.nl/sites/default/files/influenza-nieuwsbrief/GLaMOR%20project\_seasonal%20estimates.pdf](https://www.nivel.nl/sites/default/files/influenza-nieuwsbrief/GLaMOR%20project_seasonal%20estimates.pdf)
    
    Other global estimates of seasonal influenza mortality have been made by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
    
    Estimates made by GLaMOR were comparable to those by the CDC, while estimates made by IHME were around 4-5 times lower. This may be because the IHME estimated influenza mortality by first estimating the number of deaths caused by lower respiratory diseases, then estimating the fraction of those that were primarily attributed to influenza in vital records, verbal autopsies, and other mortality data. This approach would have missed many deaths caused by complications of influenza and deaths that were not specified on records to be caused by influenza due to limited testing.
    
    Both CDC and GLaMOR’s models are also likely to be underestimating the total mortality burden from influenza, as they only use data from respiratory-associated deaths. While this _would_ include deaths caused by influenza that had, for example, influenza listed as a secondary cause of death on death certificates, it _would_ _miss_ some that were caused by influenza but attributed to another cause like cardiovascular disease. Had these models used all-cause mortality to estimate deaths caused by influenza, they would have been more sensitive (captured more deaths caused by influenza) but also less specific (captured more deaths caused by other diseases that could not be distinguished easily).
    
    In comparison to CDC estimates, GLaMOR used many country-specific indicators in order to extrapolate seasonal influenza mortality to countries that did not provide weekly or monthly influenza mortality records or influenza surveillance data, while the CDC extrapolated this using mainly the WHO Global Health Estimates of respiratory mortality.
    
-   The global number of people who die from other complications of the flu is unclear.
    
    Paget et al. (the authors of the GLaMOR project) state in their paper that their estimate “does not cover cardiovascular deaths, something that could at least double the estimate of influenza-associated deaths.”
    
    In recent meta-analyses, Behrouzi et al. found that influenza vaccination reduces the chances of major cardiovascular events (such as heart attacks and strokes) by around 34%, in clinical trials of the elderly.
    
    This suggests the death toll from other complications could be large. However, global estimates have not been made of these types of deaths from flu.

    Transport accidents are counted under (V01–V99, Y85) in the ICD-10. Across 27 EU countries, these rates were 9.02, 9.15, and 8.77 per 100,000 people aged over 65 in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.
    
    Estimates of the rate of death from influenza are much lower in the ICD-10 since they only consider deaths where influenza is listed as the cause of death on death certificates, while the estimates we show above also include those that are caused by flu indirectly. This means ICD-10 death rates are likely to be highly underestimated for the flu. However, deaths caused by traffic accidents are more likely to be listed as the primary cause of death on death certificates and are much less underestimated by death certificate data.

    From 1960 to 2015, the number of deaths from influenza was estimated using a Serfling model, which estimates the excess number of deaths during flu seasons using data from the rest of the year and accounting for changes that occur year by year. Since 1997, there has also been routine testing for “influenza-like illnesses” in hospitals to determine the share of them that are actually caused by influenza, rather than other diseases. Therefore, estimates from 1997 to 2015 were also calculated using a Serfling-surveillance model, which accounted for the share of tests that were positive for influenza. This also validates the estimates from the regular Serfling model. In addition, deaths among children aged under 5 are excluded in both models, as they would be likely to include deaths from respiratory syncytial virus.
    
    Mortality in the US was slightly lower in during the 2009 Swine flu pandemic season than usual flu seasons, as severe disease shifted away from the elderly to young and middle-aged adults. However, the 2009 Swine flu pandemic led to more deaths than regular flu seasons in other countries such as Mexico.

-   Influenza viruses are thought to transmit more efficiently during the winter due to lower temperatures and humidity. But in many tropical countries, flu epidemics coincide with warm rainy seasons, so the trends may have more causes. Other explanations include seasonal changes in human immunity or changes in human behavior, such as more indoor mixing and crowding. Petrova, V. N., & Russell, C. A. (2018). The evolution of seasonal influenza viruses. _Nature Reviews Microbiology_, _16_(1), 47–60. [https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.118](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.118)
    
-   Between 1860 and 1900, there was a slight increase in the risk of death from influenza, which may have been due to worsening health conditions as more people moved into crowded urban areas.

-   These estimates are more variable for young age groups, particularly those born after 1990 because the number of influenza deaths to make comparisons were low, especially as deaths in children under 5 were excluded from the models, to avoid counting deaths from respiratory syncytial virus.

    In this post, we show the relative risks of death. This is because it’s more difficult to give an absolute risk of death from influenza at different ages, because mortality rates vary widely over time and between countries, as we saw earlier. Absolute risks depend on how many people are infected during a flu season, the availability of healthcare, the rates of vaccination, and so on. However, the _relative_ risk of death – ratio between the risk of death in one age group versus another – tends to be more consistent.

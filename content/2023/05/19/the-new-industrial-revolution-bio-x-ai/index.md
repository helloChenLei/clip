_Editor’s note: This piece was originally published in October 2021. We continue to be bullish on the power of AI to transform bio + health—especially as AI continues to drive the very industrial bio complex Vijay discusses below.  

编者按：这篇文章最初发表于 2021 年 10 月。我们继续看好 AI 改变生物 + 健康的力量——尤其是当 AI 继续推动 Vijay 在下面讨论的工业生物综合体时。_

We’ve now seen multiple trends come to fruition at the intersection of bio and technology over [the past decade](https://a16z.com/2015/11/18/bio-fund/): A Moore’s Law [for bio](https://a16z.com/2015/11/18/bio-fund/), thanks to computation; machine learning and AI [transforming](https://a16z.com/2017/07/29/when-machine-learning-becomes-ai/) many areas of bio pharma and healthcare; the ability to not just “read”, but “[write](https://a16z.com/2017/06/21/jorge-conde-bio-fund/),” to bio, including CRISPR (even [in just a](https://a16z.com/2020/10/10/16mins-nobel-prize-crispr-gene-editing-jennifer-doudna-emmanuelle-charpentier/) decade). We’re also seeing the rapid unbundling of care delivery as well now, driven by [“the great unlock](https://a16z.com/2020/08/07/healthcare-technology-great-unlock/)”–which includes the unbundling of the hospital (into decentralized communities, virtually, and more) and the movement towards value- or outcome-based care.   

在过去的十年中，我们现在已经看到多种趋势在生物和技术的交叉点取得成果：生物的摩尔定律，多亏了计算；机器学习和人工智能正在改变生物制药和医疗保健的许多领域；不仅可以“读取”，还可以“写入”生物，包括 CRISPR（即使在短短十年内）。在“大解锁”的推动下，我们现在也看到了医疗服务的快速分拆——包括医院的分拆（分拆到分散的社区，实际上，等等）以及转向基于价值或结果的运动关心。

Driving this revolution has been a [new](https://a16z.com/2017/12/14/second-bio-fund/) breed and wave of founders and [startups](https://a16z.com/2020/02/04/bio-fund-iii-announcement/) that merge the worlds of technology and bio–importantly, not just the old world of biotech (or a narrow definition of tech in bio as only “digital health”), but something much broader, bigger, and blending both worlds.  

In short, biology–enabled by technology–is [eating the world](https://a16z.com/2019/10/28/biology-eating-world-a16z-manifesto/). This has not only changed how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but has been changing the way we access, pay for, and deliver care in the healthcare system.  

It is now entering into manufacturing, food, and several other industries as well. Bio is becoming a part of everything.   

推动这场革命的是新一代创始人和初创公司的浪潮，它们融合了技术和生物世界——重要的是，不仅仅是生物技术的旧世界（或者将生物技术狭义定义为“数字健康”），而是更广泛，更大，融合两个世界的东西。简而言之，由技术驱动的生物学正在吞噬世界。这不仅改变了我们诊断、治疗和管理疾病的方式，而且一直在改变我们在医疗保健系统中获取、支付和提供护理的方式。它现在也正在进入制造、食品和其他几个行业。生物正在成为一切的一部分。

This new era of _industrialized_ bio–enabled by AI as well as an ongoing, foundational shift in biology from empirical science to more [engineered approaches](https://a16z.com/2018/11/12/how-to-engineer-biology/)–will be the next industrial revolution in human history.  

And propelling it forward is an enormous new driving force, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, its ever-evolving strains, and the resulting COVID-19 disease pandemic and response — which I believe [is analogous](https://future.com/podcasts/uncontrolled-spread-gottlieb-book-science-policy-institutions-technology-infrastructure-public-private-pandemic-emergency-beyond/) to our generation’s World War II (WW2). In other words: a massive global upheaval, but that later led to unprecedented innovation and significant new players.  

这个由人工智能驱动的工业化生物新时代，以及生物学从经验科学向更多工程方法的持续、根本性转变，将成为人类历史上的下一次工业革命。推动它向前发展的是一种巨大的新动力，新型冠状病毒 SARS-CoV-2，其不断进化的毒株，以及由此产生的 COVID-19 疾病大流行和应对——我认为这类似于我们这一代人的第二次世界大战 (WW2) ).换句话说：一场大规模的全球动荡，但后来导致了前所未有的创新和重要的新参与者。

[This new era of industrialized bio--enabled by AI as well as an ongoing, foundational shift in biology from empirical science to more engineered approaches--will be the next industrial revolution in human history.  

这个工业化生物的新时代——由人工智能以及生物学从经验科学到更多工程方法的持续、根本性转变——将成为人类历史上的下一次工业革命。](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2023/05/17/the-new-industrial-revolution-bio-x-ai/&text=This%20new%20era%20of%20industrialized%20bio--enabled%20by%20AI%20as%20well%20as%20an%20ongoing%2C%20foundational%20shift%20in%20biology%20from%20empirical%20science%20to%20more%20engineered%20approaches--will%20be%20the%20next%20industrial%20revolution%20in%20human%20history.&via=vijaypande&related=vijaypande)[Click To Tweet  点击鸣叫](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2023/05/17/the-new-industrial-revolution-bio-x-ai/&text=This%20new%20era%20of%20industrialized%20bio--enabled%20by%20AI%20as%20well%20as%20an%20ongoing%2C%20foundational%20shift%20in%20biology%20from%20empirical%20science%20to%20more%20engineered%20approaches--will%20be%20the%20next%20industrial%20revolution%20in%20human%20history.&via=vijaypande&related=vijaypande)

As a result, we will now see the emergence of _bio’s_ version of GAFA–playing off the “Google Amazon Facebook Apple” of the leading companies in computing, social, mobile–but for bio.  

And with it, a post-WW2/post-Covid “Industrial Bio Complex.”  

因此，我们现在将看到生物版 GAFA 的出现——与计算、社交、移动领域领先公司的“谷歌亚马逊 Facebook 苹果”竞争——但针对生物。随之而来的是二战后/新冠疫情后的“工业生物综合体”。

## **The World War II moment in tech x bio  

科技 x 生物的二战时刻**

Over half a century ago, we saw the modern industrial revolution decades after the war. It [began](https://www.history.com/news/world-war-ii-innovations) with [advances](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/scientific-and-technological-advances-world-war-ii) that came out during or immediately after the war, in healthcare–like flu vaccines, commercial production of penicillin, and blood transfusion–to technology advances like jet engines, radar, microwaves, and electronic computing (most notably with ENIAC, one of the world’s first general-purpose computers).  

But it was innovations in mass manufacturing and automating production–of household items, cars, etc.–that happened decades after, in the 1970s, that led to the most recent industrial revolution with later advances in semiconductors, electronics, computing, [AI](https://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/), and more.   

半个多世纪以前，我们看到了战后几十年的现代工业革命。它始于战时或战后取得的进步，从医疗保健领域（如流感疫苗、青霉素的商业生产和输血）到技术进步，如喷气发动机、雷达、微波和电子计算（最著名的是 ENIAC，世界上最早的通用计算机之一）。但正是大规模制造和自动化生产（家居用品、汽车等）的创新发生在几十年后的 1970 年代，才引发了最近的工业革命，随后在半导体、电子、计算、人工智能和更多的。

As with WW2, COVID has been a brutal wake-up call and shock to the global system.  

The mass casualties and horrors of this disease, as well as our ability to adapt and improve our response to it, will spur–[have already spurred](https://a16z.com/2021/01/08/time-to-heal-16-trends-driving-future-bio-healthcare/)–a new wave of innovation, renewed energy, and vigor in the biopharma and healthcare industries. The world now sees both the _why_ and the _how_ behind the promise of engineering in healthcare; just take for instance the speed at which and way we [developed](https://future.com/podcasts/moderna-covid-vaccine-mrna-technology/) the mRNA [vaccines](https://a16z.com/tag/vaccines/).   

与第二次世界大战一样，新冠肺炎给全球系统敲响了警钟和震惊。这种疾病的大规模伤亡和恐怖，以及我们适应和改进我们对它的反应的能力，将刺激——已经刺激了——生物制药和医疗保健行业的新一波创新、新能源和活力。世界现在看到了医疗保健工程承诺背后的原因和方式；以我们开发 mRNA 疫苗的速度和方式为例。

This is why I believe the equivalent tech revolution that follows our generation’s world war, post-Covid will be the creation of an **Industrial Bio Complex**–because the _industrialization of bio_ brings new scale, and with it, new treatments, healthier lifestyles, new manufacturing and construction that reduces the effect of climate change, and more. Bio thus becomes _the new manufacturing revolution_, where everyone pours their attention, investment, education, and efforts: Whether for safety and health, national security, or greater prosperity.   

这就是为什么我相信，在我们这一代人的世界大战之后，Covid 之后的同等技术革命将是工业生物综合体的创建——因为生物的工业化带来了新的规模，随之而来的是新的治疗方法、更健康的生活方式、新的制造以及减少气候变化影响的建筑等等。生物因此成为新的制造革命，每个人都将注意力、投资、教育和努力倾注于此：无论是为了安全和健康、国家安全还是更大的繁荣。

[Bio thus becomes the new manufacturing revolution, where everyone pours their attention, investment, education, and efforts: Whether for safety and health, national security, or greater prosperity.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to play a transformative role here. As with previous revolutions, this technology platform shift will impact industries differently.  

Notably, international scholar Carlota Perez has [illustrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital) how the technologies of the next industrial revolutions are not necessarily an aid to the previous; for example, the tech revolution of the 1970s did not majorly impact the industrialization of 1940s and 1950s goods.  

Similarly, AI ironically will _not_ have its greatest impact on the tech revolution. For areas where “compute” already dominates–that are already riding [Moore’s Law](https://a16z.com/tag/moores-law/)–AI can be overhyped; and as Casado and Bornstein explain, AI [does not](https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/) necessarily make a massive contribution to those business models.  

(It is tempting to label AI itself as an industrial revolution, but as Perez further notes, the technologies themselves are not revolutions.  

Rather, industrial revolutions reflect the _combination_ of multiple, transformative technologies into a specific, large potential market.)  

人工智能 (AI) 将继续在这里发挥变革性作用。与之前的革命一样，这种技术平台转变将对行业产生不同的影响。值得注意的是，国际学者卡洛塔·佩雷斯 (Carlota Perez) 已经说明了下一次工业革命的技术不一定是对前一次工业革命的帮助；例如，1970 年代的科技革命并未对 1940 年代和 50 年代商品的工业化产生重大影响。同样，具有讽刺意味的是，人工智能不会对技术革命产生最大的影响。对于“计算”已经占据主导地位的领域——已经遵循摩尔定律——人工智能可能被夸大了；正如 Casado 和 Bornstein 解释的那样，AI 不一定会对这些商业模式做出巨大贡献。 （人们很容易将 AI 本身标记为工业革命，但正如 Perez 进一步指出的那样，技术本身并不是革命。相反，工业革命反映了多种变革性技术与特定的、巨大的潜在市场的结合。）

In the bio and healthcare market, which is largely dominated by _services_, we would expect to see potentially massive gains from AI–at least to the extent that AI can transform services into “compute.” AI is not always as useful [in enterprise](https://a16z.com/tag/on-the-economics-of-ai-ml-data-businesses/) because it is slower than the status quo, more expensive in terms of unit economics, etc.  

But in bio, AI can be extremely helpful: It helps turn the things that used to be expensive, human-labor intensive, less efficient, and less accessible, into less costly, more efficient, and even more effective “compute.”  

在主要由服务主导的生物和医疗保健市场中，我们预计会看到人工智能带来的潜在巨大收益——至少在人工智能可以将服务转化为“计算”的范围内。人工智能在企业中并不总是那么有用，因为它比现状慢，在单位经济方面更昂贵等。但在生物领域，人工智能可能非常有用：它有助于将过去昂贵的东西，人类 -劳动密集型、效率低下且不易获得，转变为成本更低、效率更高甚至更有效的“计算”。

Once that happens, technology can penetrate into the industries that previously did not benefit from the IT revolution.  

In fact, economists and innovators have long wondered why we haven’t seen the kinds of massive gains we’ve seen in other industries, in healthcare–aka [Baumol’s Cost Disease](https://future.com/podcasts/cost-disease-healthcare-baumol/)–because when technology successfully penetrates industries, it transforms formerly expensive services into much more affordable goods.  

(And frees up human labor to work on more meaningful work, which is where it could help in healthcare. In other words, technology can make human healthcare more _human_.)   

一旦发生这种情况，技术就可以渗透到以前没有从 IT 革命中受益的行业。事实上，经济学家和创新者长期以来一直想知道为什么我们没有看到我们在其他行业、医疗保健领域看到的那种巨大收益——又名 Baumol 成本病——因为当技术成功渗透到各个行业时，它将以前昂贵的服务转变为更多更实惠的商品。 （并解放人类劳动以从事更有意义的工作，这正是它可以在医疗保健方面提供帮助的地方。换句话说，技术可以使人类医疗保健更加人性化。）

We are poised on this cusp today. Until now, healthcare and biotechnology have been heavily dominated by services–provided by expertly trained scientists and [doctors](https://a16z.com/2019/06/13/ai-doctor-deep-medicine-topol/)–that algorithms could not replace, let alone add enough value, to make sense for companies to adopt them. But now, we are at the very beginning of a revolution where [AI is](https://a16z.com/2019/11/19/ai-industrializing-discovery-biology-healthcare/) _industrializing_ biopharma and healthcare, and it is being applied to everything from [drug design](https://a16z.com/2020/05/26/investing-insitro/) and [diagnostics](https://a16z.com/2017/03/01/going-deeper-into-freenome/) to [healthcare delivery](https://a16z.com/2021/07/12/investing-in-bayesian-health/) and [back-office functions](https://a16z.com/2021/02/09/administration-healthcare-back-office-innovation/). (As for concerns or challenges that often come up with discussions of applying AI in bio, I address the “black box” of AI in healthcare [here](https://a16z.com/2018/02/28/black-box-problem-ai-healthcare/); and address what’s needed for us to get smart \[vs. “dumb”\] AI in bio, [here](https://a16z.com/2021/06/15/ai-is-too-dumb-for-now-2/).)  

我们今天正处于这个风口浪尖。到目前为止，医疗保健和生物技术一直主要由受过专业训练的科学家和医生提供的服务主导，算法无法取代，更不用说增加足够的价值，使公司采用它们有意义。但现在，我们正处于一场革命的开端，AI 正在使生物制药和医疗保健产业化，并且它被应用于从药物设计和诊断到医疗保健交付和后台功能的方方面面。 （至于在生物领域应用人工智能的讨论中经常出现的担忧或挑战，我在这里解决了人工智能在医疗保健中的“黑匣子”；并解决了我们需要什么才能变得聪明\[与“愚蠢”\]生物领域的人工智能， 这里 。）

[But now, we are at the very beginning of a revolution where AI is industrializing biopharma and healthcare, and it is being applied to everything from drug design and diagnostics to healthcare delivery and back-office functions.  

但现在，我们正处于一场革命的开端，AI 正在使生物制药和医疗保健产业化，并且它正在应用于从药物设计和诊断到医疗保健交付和后台功能的方方面面。](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2023/05/17/the-new-industrial-revolution-bio-x-ai/&text=But%20now%2C%20we%20are%20at%20the%20very%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution%20where%20AI%20is%20industrializing%20biopharma%20and%20healthcare%2C%20and%20it%20is%20being%20applied%20to%20everything%20from%20drug%20design%20and%20diagnostics%20to%20healthcare%20delivery%20and%20back-office%20functions.&via=vijaypande&related=vijaypande)[Click To Tweet  点击鸣叫](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://a16z.com/2023/05/17/the-new-industrial-revolution-bio-x-ai/&text=But%20now%2C%20we%20are%20at%20the%20very%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution%20where%20AI%20is%20industrializing%20biopharma%20and%20healthcare%2C%20and%20it%20is%20being%20applied%20to%20everything%20from%20drug%20design%20and%20diagnostics%20to%20healthcare%20delivery%20and%20back-office%20functions.&via=vijaypande&related=vijaypande)

In all these areas (and others yet to be seen), the industrialization of biopharma and healthcare can go a long way.  

Instead of a person training in an apprenticeship-like way to do something, for instance, the machine learns those things.  

We can make copies trivially, which lets us scale expertise in the same manner as we spin up cloud-based servers: Immediately, cheaply (compared to expert labor), and at immense scale.  

And this is not limited purely to compute: Automation and robotics similarly enables scale, as well as further enabling true [reproducibility](https://a16z.com/2018/11/12/how-to-engineer-biology/) of biology in a way not previously possible–thus addressing one of the greatest weaknesses of “pre-industrialized” bio.  

在所有这些领域（以及其他有待观察的领域），生物制药和医疗保健的产业化大有可为。例如，机器学习这些东西，而不是像学徒一样训练一个人去做某事。我们可以简单地制作副本，这让我们可以像启动基于云的服务器一样扩展专业知识：立即、廉价（与专家劳动力相比），并且规模巨大。这不仅限于计算：自动化和机器人技术同样可以实现规模化，并以前所未有的方式进一步实现生物学的真正可重复性——从而解决“工业化前”生物的最大弱点之一。

Bio can now scale, massively.    

Bio 现在可以大规模扩展。

## **Where and** **_how_** **do we go from here?**  

我们怎么走？

Drawing on lessons from the last two decades in _tech_, what would we expect to see for the next two decades in _tech x bio_? What happens as we move even more so into [engineering biology](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/a16z-guide-science-becomes-engineering/), and what are the consequences of two mega trends–the industrialization of bio, plus the post-WW2/post-Covid effect–coming together?   

吸取过去二十年科技领域的经验教训，我们期望在未来二十年的科技 x 生物领域看到什么？当我们更深入地进入工程生物学时会发生什么？两大趋势——生物工业化，加上二战后/新冠疫情后的影响——结合在一起的结果是什么？

Consider for instance the last decade of mobile, and the [cycles](https://a16z.com/tag/innovation-curves/) of how innovation happens in technology.  

Referencing Carlota Perez’s influential work again: Mobile, like many technologies before it, had an “installation” phase that preceded a “deployment” phase.  

Perez’s concepts are summarized well [here](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html) by Jerry Neumann, but basically, in the **installation phase**, capital flows to building the infrastructure that technological revolution needs; this installation phase also requires more push than pull, which is where go-to-market, [partnerships](https://a16z.com/2021/09/08/platform-partnership-fit-for-bio-startups/), and other business development especially matters for bio startups here.  

例如，考虑移动的最后十年，以及技术创新发生的周期。再次引用 Carlota Perez 的有影响力的工作：移动和之前的许多技术一样，在“部署”阶段之前有一个“安装”阶段。 Jerry Neumann 在这里很好地总结了 Perez 的概念，但基本上，在安装阶段，资金流向建设技术革命所需的基础设施；这个安装阶段也需要更多的推动而不是拉动，这是进入市场、合作伙伴关系和其他业务发展对这里的生物初创公司尤为重要的地方。

Then, in the **deployment phase** of a particular technological revolution–which [mobile reached after](https://youtu.be/3d7zZz_niTc) we passed 2.5+ billion smartphones on earth–companies often move towards expanding and consolidating their existing markets, not just _creating_ them. In this phase, companies begin competing even more so on cost, usability, and scale; for mobile, the shift led to new [questions](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/12/8/mobile-is-eating-the-world), such as “what can we build as we stand on the shoulders of giants”? (The giants in that case being companies like Apple and Google.)  

然后，在特定技术革命的部署阶段——我们在地球上拥有超过 25 亿部智能手机后移动达到了这一阶段——公司通常会扩大和巩固他们现有的市场，而不仅仅是创造它们。在此阶段，公司开始在成本、可用性和规模方面展开更多竞争；对于移动端，这种转变引发了新的问题，例如“站在巨人的肩膀上，我们可以构建什么”？ （在这种情况下，巨头是苹果和谷歌等公司。）

I expect tech x bio to follow a similar path.  

Right now, we are at the juncture of realizing we need the ability to engineer bio, and a fuller ability to engineer it (i.e., we’re still in the installation phase).  

In the tech industry, the analog period for the web led to the creation of massive companies like Amazon and Google.  

Given the power of the combined trends–and the scale of the challenges and massive market of healthcare–we should expect to similarly see the rise of a few potentially trillion-dollar companies at scale: the equivalent of a **Bio GAFA**, finally.   

我希望 tech x bio 遵循类似的路径。现在，我们正处于意识到我们需要设计生物的能力，以及更全面的设计它的能力的关键时刻（即，我们仍处于安装阶段）。在科技行业，网络的模拟时期催生了亚马逊和谷歌等大型公司。鉴于综合趋势的力量——以及挑战的规模和庞大的医疗保健市场——我们应该期望类似地看到一些规模可能达到万亿美元的公司的崛起：最终相当于 Bio GAFA。

For tech x bio founders, this means their ambitions can be bigger and more attainable than ever, if they are able to execute.  

For the industry, it means ways to address the systemic and structural problems of healthcare, which are currently fragmented or consolidated in all the wrong ways (not to mention entrenched in legacy silos and structures that technology can re-route around).  

Most importantly, for all of us, the gains of the Industrial Bio Complex should lead to healthier, longer, and richer lives through greatly improved care and access, at lower cost.   

对于 tech x bio 的创始人来说，这意味着如果他们能够执行，他们的抱负可以比以往任何时候都更大、更容易实现。对于行业而言，这意味着解决医疗保健系统性和结构性问题的方法，这些问题目前以各种错误的方式分散或整合（更不用说根深蒂固的遗留孤岛和技术可以重新路由的结构）。最重要的是，对于我们所有人来说，工业生物综合体的收益应该能够以更低的成本大大改善护理和获取，从而带来更健康、更长寿和更丰富的生活。

Although it’s still early, there are a few tell-tale signs at this early-stage of what an emerging, future Bio GAFA company would look like:   

虽然现在还早，但在这个早期阶段有一些迹象表明未来的 Bio GAFA 公司会是什么样子：

### **Full stack companies 全栈公司**

The rise of [full stack](https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/) companies–which build a complete, end-to-end product or service–can bypass incumbents and other competitors, if executed well. An analogy that is [often used](https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/) on the consumer side is ridesharing, where many companies had previously tried to build and sell software directly to the taxi/limo industry, but those companies were not set up to assess let alone absorb such software.  

It was only when companies like Lyft and Uber came along and asked what the industry could look like if it were rebuilt from scratch that using technology for ridesharing finally arrived.  

如果执行得当，全栈公司的崛起——构建完整的端到端产品或服务——可以绕过现有企业和其他竞争对手。消费者方面经常使用的一个类比是拼车，许多公司以前曾尝试直接向出租车/豪华轿车行业开发和销售软件，但这些公司并没有评估，更不用说吸收此类软件了。只有当像 Lyft 和 Uber 这样的公司出现并询问如果从头开始重建这个行业会是什么样子时，使用拼车技术的技术才终于到来。

Similarly, incumbents in healthcare are not prepared to absorb advanced technology.  

Merely adding AI or other technology on top of an existing organization will not have as great an impact as redesigning the entire organization from the ground up to utilize that technology, natively, as you can only do in a startup.   

同样，医疗保健领域的从业者也不准备吸收先进技术。仅仅在现有组织之上添加 AI 或其他技术所产生的影响不如从头开始重新设计整个组织以在本地利用该技术，因为你只能在初创公司中这样做。

In healthcare, there are many business models for this, but one framework for scalable business models to use here is “compete or connect,” which Vineeta Agarwala [has written](https://a16z.com/2021/06/15/compete-or-connect-scalable-business-models-in-bio-2/) about.  

Bio companies that “compete” aim to become full-stack competitors to existing players in the big three bio-enterprise categories (life sciences, provider, or payor)–as opposed to selling into those industries (“connect” to customers via others).  

This compete-or-connect [framework](https://a16z.com/2021/06/15/compete-or-connect-scalable-business-models-in-bio-2/) could also help founders and investors assess which bio companies, out of thousands of startups, are likely to have the greatest impact and scale, and which business models will endure the test of time.   

在医疗保健领域，有许多商业模式，但这里使用的可扩展商业模式的一个框架是“竞争或联系”，Vineeta Agarwala 已经写过。 “竞争”的生物公司旨在成为三大生物企业类别（生命科学、供应商或付款人）现有参与者的全栈竞争对手——而不是向这些行业销售（通过其他行业“连接”客户） .这种竞争或联系的框架还可以帮助创始人和投资者评估在数千家初创公司中哪些生物公司可能产生最大的影响和规模，以及哪些商业模式将经受住时间的考验。

### **Government as buyer, not builder 政府作为买家，而不是建设者**

The Manhattan Project, in its early forms, was formed by the U.S. president and government right before and during World War II, combining–and coordinating–various research and technology efforts to help fight the war.  

Vannevar Bush, the Director of the then-Office of Scientific Research & Development that administered the Manhattan Project early on, later also wrote the famous “[Science, the Endless Frontier](https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm)” report–which led to the creation of the National Science Foundation. However, I do not see a Manhattan Project for healthcare (or for the environment) emerging from the U.S. political system today, which is not structurally set up for this scale of coordination and technological innovation.  

Take just for one example [how we struggled](https://future.com/podcasts/uncontrolled-spread-gottlieb-book-science-policy-institutions-technology-infrastructure-public-private-pandemic-emergency-beyond/) with the scale and coordination required for implementing testing, as compared to the private sector response, technological capabilities elsewhere, and who has the ability to innovate faster/better.   

早期形式的曼哈顿计划是由美国总统和政府在第二次世界大战之前和期间成立的，它结合并协调了各种研究和技术努力，以帮助打仗。早期负责管理曼哈顿计划的时任科学研究与发展办公室主任万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 后来还撰写了著名的“科学，无尽的前沿”报告，该报告促成了国家科学基金会的成立。然而，我没有看到今天的美国政治体系出现医疗保健（或环境）曼哈顿计划，该计划在结构上不是为这种规模的协调和技术创新而设立的。仅举一个例子，与私营部门的反应、其他地方的技术能力以及谁有能力更快/更好地创新相比，我们如何在实施测试所需的规模和协调方面苦苦挣扎。

But government does have an enormously consequential role as a buyer.  

In particular, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have long been a locus and driver of innovation for healthcare–whether it’s through the Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs; policies incentivizing [data sharing](https://a16z.com/2020/03/14/16mins-hhs-data-rules-onc-cms-patients-providers-payers-startups-incumbents/), [pricing](https://a16z.com/2020/07/15/marty-makary-price-transparency-healthcare/), and [transparency](https://a16z.com/2020/11/20/16mins-transparency-in-coverage-rules-cms-hhs-healthcare-pricing-cost-patients-payers-hospitals-comparison-competition/); utilizing alternative [site-of-care](https://a16z.com/2021/01/08/new-tech-stack-virtual-first-care/); and adopting [value-based](https://a16z.com/2019/09/08/value-based-healthcare-outcomes-conway/) payment schemes.  

CMS tends to be the tip of the spear to the broader payor market, especially in terms of reimbursement–when they implement new reimbursement policies and value-based payment programs, the commercial payors tend to follow suit.  

Julie Yoo often [observes that](https://twitter.com/julesyoo/status/1418305801337278464) government-sponsored healthcare payment programs are “the tail that wags the dog” on not just the ~$1.5 trillion spent under Medicare and Medicaid every year, but also the $1.2 trillion spent in the private health insurance market.   

但政府作为买家确实发挥着极其重要的作用。特别是，医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心 (CMS) 是卫生与公共服务部 (HHS) 的一部分，长期以来一直是医疗保健创新的中心和推动力——无论是通过医疗保险和医疗补助保险计划；激励数据共享、定价和透明度的政策；利用替代护理地点；采用基于价值的支付方案。 CMS 往往是更广泛的付款人市场的矛头，尤其是在报销方面——当他们实施新的报销政策和基于价值的支付计划时，商业付款人往往会效仿。 Julie Yoo 经常观察到，政府资助的医疗支付计划是“摇尾巴”，不仅是每年在 Medicare 和 Medicaid 下花费的约 1.5 万亿美元，而且也是在私人医疗保险市场花费的 1.2 万亿美元。

As such, in the coming Industrial Bio Complex, the winners will inevitably embrace working with federal and local government programs to tap into the massive payment rails, once they get to population-level scale.  

Current category leaders are already doing this by leveraging their platforms–which are lower cost and more nimble–to be the technology “execution arm” for many of CMS’s new value-based care initiatives, focusing on senior-citizen and low-income patient populations.  

It often plays out, Yoo [observes](https://a16z.com/2020/08/07/healthcare-technology-great-unlock/), in the form of [advanced primary care models](https://a16z.com/2020/04/22/primary-care-new-operating-system/) or full-stack tech-enabled carriers.   

因此，在即将到来的 Industrial Bio Complex 中，一旦达到人口规模，获胜者将不可避免地接受与联邦和地方政府项目的合作，以利用大规模的支付渠道。目前的类别领导者已经通过利用他们的平台——成本更低、更灵活——成为 CMS 许多新的基于价值的护理计划的技术“执行臂”来做到这一点，重点是老年公民和低收入患者群体. Yoo 观察到，它经常以先进的初级保健模式或全栈技术支持的运营商的形式发挥作用。

### **Bridges and builds from both sides  

双方的桥梁和建筑**

While the ambitions of the next Bio GAFA companies will be huge, and necessarily visionary–the companies that achieve this will be more grounded in reality.  

To succeed, they will recognize the challenges of applying bio and technology, that in practice very much still remain.   

虽然下一个 Bio GAFA 公司的抱负将是巨大的，而且必然是有远见的——实现这一目标的公司将更加立足于现实。为了取得成功，他们将认识到应用生物和技术的挑战，这些挑战在实践中仍然存在。

A drug company that assumes biology is “easy” or as predictable as in other areas of tech will fail in its attempts to engineer biology, even with the most powerful AI.  

A healthcare delivery company that likewise underestimates the complexity and challenges of the U.S. healthcare system will also fail.  

The successful companies will not only bring a healthy dose of reality, but bring together experts from _both_ sides–tech and bio–and from the ground up, in building their companies.  

假设生物学与其他技术领域一样“简单”或可预测的制药公司将无法尝试设计生物学，即使使用最强大的人工智能也是如此。同样低估美国医疗保健系统的复杂性和挑战的医疗保健服务公司也将失败。成功的公司不仅会带来健康的现实，还会汇集技术和生物两方面的专家，从头开始建设他们的公司。

Along these lines, tech, biopharma, and healthcare are often treated in startup-land as separate worlds, with different sets of investors for each.  

But we are already seeing these lines blur: Therapeutics take on more of healthcare delivery, as we’ve [seen](https://a16z.com/2020/02/07/car-t-therapy-company-building-cancer-cure/) in engineered cell therapies. Drug [companies](https://a16z.com/2020/01/12/why-were-investing-in-eqrx/) go directly to payors. And diagnostic [companies](https://a16z.com/2017/03/01/going-deeper-into-freenome/) seek to change the very nature of care.  

沿着这些思路，科技、生物制药和医疗保健在创业领域通常被视为独立的世界，每个世界都有不同的投资者群体。但我们已经看到这些界限变得模糊：正如我们在工程细胞疗法中看到的那样，治疗学承担了更多的医疗保健服务。制药公司直接与付款人联系。诊断公司寻求改变医疗的本质。

### **Assets  →  Platforms  →  Channels  

资产 → 平台 → 渠道**

In biopharma, we are already seeing companies go from focusing on _assets_ to _platforms_ (as Jorge Conde [outlines](https://a16z.com/tag/bio-platforms-series/))–thanks to AI, automation, and other engineering that turns bespoke craftsmanship into industrialized drug development. However, the trajectory can go even further: These _companies can also become channels_. This is another potential indicator of the companies that will realize Bio GAFA.  

在生物制药领域，我们已经看到公司从关注资产转向平台（正如 Jorge Conde 概述的那样）——这要归功于人工智能、自动化和其他将定制工艺转化为工业化药物开发的工程。然而，轨迹可以走得更远：这些公司也可以成为渠道。这是将实现 Bio GAFA 的公司的另一个潜在指标。

Traditional biotech companies are often so-called single-asset companies–developing, testing, and commercializing a single therapeutic coming from discovery–in what was a somewhat serendipitous search for some drug that actually worked in the complex context of biology.  

Now, new age platform companies can engineer subsequent therapeutics from _earlier_ designs, building on knowledge in an iterative way, given the ability to derive and replicate via technology (often [very quickly](https://future.com/podcasts/moderna-covid-vaccine-mrna-technology/)).  

AI in drug discovery companies can use industrialized processes–automating biology and chemistry experiments that feed into advanced machine learning technologies–to turn what was formerly manual and had a low hit-rate into something that is more repeatable, predictable, and mass-industralizable.  

And even in its misses, these technologies allow us to learn even from failures, improving (in general) through successive iterations; we are already [starting to see](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johncumbers/2021/03/31/a-new-approach-to-crisprscribe-therapeutics-engineers-novel-crispr-molecules/?sh=6cf11f8243fa) this in CRISPR and CAR T.   

传统的生物技术公司通常是所谓的单一资产公司——开发、测试和商业化一种来自发现的单一疗法——在某种程度上偶然发现一些在生物学的复杂背景下实际起作用的药物。现在，新时代的平台公司可以根据早期设计设计后续疗法，以迭代方式构建知识，并具有通过技术推导和复制的能力（通常非常快）。药物发现公司中的 AI 可以使用工业化流程——将生物学和化学实验自动化，将其输入到先进的机器学习技术中——将以前的手工操作和低命中率变成更可重复、可预测和可大规模工业化的东西。即使在失误中，这些技术也能让我们从失败中吸取教训，通过连续的迭代改进（通常）；我们已经开始在 CRISPR 和 CAR T 中看到这一点。

As [bio platforms](https://a16z.com/2021/01/08/bio-platform-companies/) become more productive than ever before (able to deliver on the promise of multiple new therapeutics), the bottleneck shifts from _discovery_ to _development_.  

So early-stage startups with finite resources will need to prioritize and pace the diseases their (otherwise broadly applicable) platform can address, and then interrogate and advance the promising drug candidates through clinical development hurdles (either in-house or via [partnerships](https://a16z.com/2021/09/08/platform-partnership-fit-for-bio-startups/)). But the productive platform that also figures out _distribution_ for itself can now become the channel for many others, further leveraging what they’ve built: They can sell multiple products into the market, much like Amazon used its marketplace and commercial infrastructure to go beyond selling books to selling, well, everything.   

随着生物平台变得比以往任何时候都更有效率（能够兑现多种新疗法的承诺），瓶颈从发现转移到开发。因此，资源有限的早期创业公司需要优先考虑和调整他们（否则广泛适用）平台可以解决的疾病，然后通过临床开发障碍（内部或通过合作伙伴关系）询问和推进有前途的候选药物。但是这个也为自己解决分销问题的生产平台现在可以成为许多其他人的渠道，进一步利用他们已经建立的东西：他们可以向市场销售多种产品，就像亚马逊利用其市场和商业基础设施超越销售一样卖书，嗯，一切。

And, naturally, this won’t be limited to biopharma. Technology-enabled [approaches](https://a16z.com/2018/10/16/devoted/) to Medicare–assembling patients, [providers](https://a16z.com/2018/10/16/devoted/), and [payors](https://a16z.com/author/sean-duffy/)–creates channels for other applications (such as telemedicine and novel diagnostics), all aligned by value-based reimbursement rails.  

Companies can now more effectively help patients by becoming a single, direct point of contact with patients, enabling a broad range of technologies that can decrease costs and impact patient lives.  

而且，自然地，这不会仅限于生物制药。技术支持的 Medicare 方法——汇集患者、提供者和付款人——为其他应用程序（如远程医疗和新诊断）创建渠道，所有这些都与基于价值的报销轨道保持一致。公司现在可以通过成为与患者的单一直接联系点来更有效地帮助患者，从而实现能够降低成本并影响患者生活的广泛技术。

## **Building the bio economy 建设生物经济**

There’s greater potential than ever to engineer biology into huge markets beyond just pharma and health–manufacturing, construction, durable goods, etc.–especially in ways that combat, rather than exacerbate, climate change.  

There’s growing consumer demand for all this, but to date, there haven’t been many strong places (in bio) to satisfy it.   

现在比以往任何时候都更有潜力将生物学工程引入巨大的市场，而不仅仅是制药和健康——制造、建筑、耐用品等——尤其是在对抗而不是加剧气候变化的方面。消费者对这一切的需求不断增长，但迄今为止，还没有很多强大的地方（在生物领域）可以满足它。

Furthermore, such technologies applied to bio could raise the prosperity of many more countries and workers around the world.  

For instance, just by replacing the costly, inaccessible logistics cold chain through which we get our fruits and vegetables with [applied material-science advances](https://a16z.com/author/james-rogers/), entire countries could advance–much like mobile phones enabled countries to leapfrog into the modern era.  

We’re seeing similar advances in the engineering of food itself for health and global sustainability.   

此外，应用于生物的此类技术可以促进世界上更多国家和工人的繁荣。例如，只要用应用材料科学的进步取代我们获取水果和蔬菜的昂贵、难以进入的物流冷链，整个国家都可以进步——就像手机使国家能够跨越到现代时代一样。我们在食品本身的健康和全球可持续发展工程方面看到了类似的进步。

Another huge potential opportunity along these lines is the ability to replace petroleum-based plastics infrastructure with biomaterials, including even those that can sequester carbon from the air, allowing near zero (or even negative, given cap-and-trade) cost of goods.  

While these advances have not fully arrived into consumer’s hands yet, the roadmap for building them is clear, as is the power of consumers who want to transform the status quo.  

These forces may finally lead us into a more bio-based, than petroleum-based, economy.  

沿着这些路线的另一个巨大的潜在机会是能够用生物材料取代基于石油的塑料基础设施，甚至包括那些可以从空气中吸收碳的材料，从而使商品成本接近于零（或者甚至为负，考虑到限额与交易）。虽然这些进步尚未完全到达消费者手中，但构建它们的路线图是明确的，想要改变现状的消费者的力量也是如此。这些力量可能最终会带领我们进入一个更加以生物为基础而非以石油为基础的经济体。

With bio, an unprecedented era of innovation awaits.   

有了 bio，一个前所未有的创新时代正在等待着我们。

## Conclusion

The Covid pandemic, even when it ends, will have lasting consequences: Not only in accelerating several trends (we [wrote about 16](https://a16z.com/2021/01/08/time-to-heal-16-trends-driving-future-bio-healthcare/)) that transform biology, medicine, and healthcare, but in other industries, too. While I believe it is [our generation’s world war](https://future.com/podcasts/uncontrolled-spread-gottlieb-book-science-policy-institutions-technology-infrastructure-public-private-pandemic-emergency-beyond/), whether or not you agree that’s the correct analogy, there are undeniable parallels to the pre- vs. post-world war waves of technology innovation here.    

Covid 大流行，即使结束，也会产生持久的影响：不仅会加速改变生物学、医学和医疗保健的几种趋势（我们写了大约 16 个），而且还会影响其他行业。虽然我认为这是我们这一代人的世界大战，但无论您是否同意这是正确的类比，这里都与世界大战前后的技术创新浪潮有着不可否认的相似之处。

We haven’t yet recovered from, let alone ended, this Covid war, but when we do, we’ll usher in an era of _bio-based_ development that should lead to massive, tech-like Bio GAFA companies. What are we going to build? And what are we going to learn from the lessons of the past?   

我们还没有从这场 Covid 战争中恢复过来，更不用说结束了，但当我们恢复过来时，我们将迎来一个以生物为基础的发展时代，这个时代应该会催生出大规模的、类似技术的 Bio GAFA 公司。我们要建造什么？我们将从过去的教训中吸取什么教训？

Given then-President Eisenhower’s warning of the Military Industrial Complex post World War II, the more obvious WW2 analog here could be a _Bio Industrial Complex_–a ramping up of government’s interaction with Bio in the way we saw with Defense post WW2 (with both positive and negative connotations, because it’s certainly true that any powerful technology has the potential for both good and harm).  

But my point here is that is not something government can create–even if it could, we would likely end up with the equivalent of a $700B/year bio budget 20 years from now, buying tech nobody wants or needs, while creating more problems than solving them.   

考虑到当时的艾森豪威尔总统对二战后军事工业综合体的警告，这里更明显的 WW2 类比可能是生物工业综合体——政府与生物体互动的增加，就像我们在二战后看到的国防一样（两者都是积极的和负面含义，因为任何强大的技术都有可能带来好处和坏处，这当然是真的）。但我的意思是，这不是政府可以创造的东西——即使它可以，从现在起 20 年后，我们最终可能会得到相当于 700B 美元/年的生物预算，购买没人想要或不需要的技术，同时制造更多问题而不是解决它们。

The difference between the Bio Industrial Complex, then, and the Industrial Bio Complex–which leads with the industrialization of bio and comes to fruition with Bio GAFA–rewards the best of the 1000 experiments that can bloom in the marketplace of startups.  

These companies can’t be made, but are born.  

And the only way we can solve or even materially address the enormously challenging and consequential problems of our time is through such forces and scale.  

In the end, choosing to harness these forces for good is what will allow us to build the Industrial Bio Complex–something that takes the benefit of scale, for a better world.  

Bio Industrial Complex 与 Industrial Bio Complex 之间的区别——引领生物工业化并通过 Bio GAFA 取得成果——奖励了 1000 个可以在初创公司市场上开花结果的实验中最好的。这些公司不是建立的，而是天生的。我们能够解决甚至实质性地解决我们这个时代极具挑战性和后果严重的问题的唯一方法就是通过这种力量和规模。最后，选择善用这些力量将使我们能够建立工业生物综合体——利用规模优势，创造一个更美好的世界。

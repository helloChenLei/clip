_“To your grave there’s no use taking any gold,  

"在你的坟墓里，带任何金子都没用、_  

_You cannot use it when it’s time for hands to fold,  

您不能在弃牌时使用它、_  

_When you leave this earth for a better home someday,  

当你有一天离开这个世界，前往更好的家园时、_  

_The only thing you’ll take is what you gave away.”  

"你唯一能带走的，就是你送出的东西"_  

_– Grandpa Jones   

\- 琼斯爷爷_

While most girls my age were content to go to the mall and get mani pedis, at 17 years old, I wanted to enter the religious life.  

与我同龄的大多数女孩都满足于逛商场和修指甲，而 17 岁的我却想过宗教生活。  

I went to an all girls Catholic high school in the South, and I come from a very devout Polish Catholic family.   

我上的是一所位于南部的天主教女子高中，我来自一个非常虔诚的波兰天主教家庭。

And while the joke is that every good Catholic kid wants to enter the religious life at some point, I think my vocational yearning was the misplaced desire to generally do good in my community.  

虽然有人开玩笑说，每个优秀的天主教孩子都想在某个时候进入宗教生活，但我认为我对职业的渴望是错位的，我只是想在我的社区里做一些好事。  

Albeit, my faith encouraged me to do things that other teenagers might have been too uncertain to do.  

尽管我的信仰鼓励我去做一些其他青少年可能不敢去做的事情。

But one of those spiritual quests ended up providing the basis for the rest of my adult life, with or without a nun’s habit. 

  

但其中的一项精神追求最终为我成年后的生活奠定了基础，无论是否穿上修女服。

As part of our graduation requirements, we had to participate in service learning my junior year of high school during the time slot allotted for our theology class.  

作为毕业要求的一部分，我们必须在高三时利用神学课的时间参加服务学习。  

We were given a list of places in our city to volunteer and told to pick one that we’d be interested in.  

我们拿到了一份本市志愿服务地点的清单，并被告知挑选一个自己感兴趣的地点。  

Of course, dozens of girls selected the animal shelter, the park, the library, and daycares.  

当然，几十个女孩选择了动物收容所、公园、图书馆和托儿所。  

My eyes fell to the bottom of the list, a location with 0 volunteers — our local Hospice.   

我的目光落在了名单的最下面，一个没有志愿者的地方--我们当地的临终关怀机构。

Even at 17, I wasn’t deterred by death.  

即使 17 岁，我也没有被死亡吓倒。  

I’d already experienced several significant losses in my life — cherished pets, my grandparents who helped raise me, and my youngest brother, as well as countless friends.  

在我的生命中，我已经经历过几次重大损失--我珍爱的宠物、帮助抚养我长大的祖父母、我最小的弟弟以及数不清的朋友。  

I figured that if anyone in my class was equipped with the skills to serve the dying, it was probably me.   

我想，如果班里有人具备为临终者服务的技能，那可能就是我了。

Unsurprisingly, during the next class period the teacher confirmed that I would be serving at Hospice three times a week for the semester.  

不出所料，在下一堂课上，老师确认我将在本学期每周到临终关怀中心服务三次。  

But to my surprise, one of my other classmates and friends had signed up with me, a girl named Katy.  

但出乎我意料的是，我的另一位同学和朋友也和我一起报了名，她叫凯蒂。  

We both became known as “The Katies of Death” in our theology class.   

我们俩在神学课上被称为 "死亡凯蒂"。

When Katy and I showed up to Hospice, we filled out the usual paperwork and had our volunteer badges made before being taken to the front desk, where we would receive the patient roster from the old, grandmotherly nurse.  

当我和凯蒂来到安宁疗护中心时，我们填写了常规的文件并制作了志愿者徽章，然后被带到前台，在那里我们将从年迈的祖母级护士手中接过病人名册。  

Each sheet had a patient’s name, gender, age, any conditions, how long they had been there, any notes or requests from the patient, and whether or not any family was present.  

每张花名册上都有病人的姓名、性别、年龄、病情、住院时间、病人的备注或要求，以及是否有家属在场。  

Some patients had huge families with them at all hours, but that’s not who I was there to serve.  

有些病人有一大家子人全天候陪护，但这不是我的服务对象。  

Katy and I often spent our first few weeks going to each room together as a pair, getting to know patients.   

凯蒂和我经常在最初的几周里结伴去每个病房，了解病人。

Not everyone goes to Hospice to die — some patients had been in Hospice for months.  

并不是每个人去安宁疗护都是为了死亡--有些病人已经在安宁疗护中度过了几个月。  

Some patients would go in and out of Hospice for years.  

有些病人在安宁疗护中进进出出好几年。  

Some were there on the day we visited, and they were gone the next.   

有些病人在我们探访的当天还在，第二天就走了。

Some of the patients that we met were very colorful and knew that they weren’t going to die just yet.  

我们遇到的一些病人非常丰富多彩，他们知道自己还不会死。  

One was Mr. K, a very crotchety veteran that the nurses generally dreaded tending to.  

其中一位是 K 先生，他是一位非常古怪的退伍军人，护士们一般都很害怕照顾他。  

They warned us before we went in that he was anything but a ray of sunshine.  

他们在我们进去之前就警告我们，他不是一缕阳光。  

I didn’t feel too deterred — I had helped care for my senile grandmother in her final years, and figured it would be nothing new.   

我并没有感到害怕，因为我曾在我年迈的祖母晚年时帮助照顾过她，我想这并不是什么新鲜事。

Mr. K was gruff and pessimistic.  

K 先生脾气暴躁、悲观厌世。  

He spent most of his time complaining about everything that crossed his mind.  

他大部分时间都在抱怨他想到的一切。  

He complained about the weather. He complained about his ex wife, whom he hadn’t seen in decades.  

他抱怨天气。他抱怨几十年未见的前妻。  

He complained about sports, politics, religion, and everything in between.  

他抱怨体育、政治、宗教，以及介于两者之间的一切。  

He seemed delighted, though, that I didn’t try to hinder his complaining, and was pleased that I attentively listened to his advice about not marrying someone from a different political or religious background.  

不过，他似乎很高兴我没有试图阻止他的抱怨，也很高兴我认真听取了他关于不要和政治或宗教背景不同的人结婚的建议。  

I knew a lot of this was the musings of a frustrated old man, but I realized that he hadn’t had someone who would just _listen_ to him.  

我知道这很多都是一个沮丧的老人的胡思乱想，但我意识到，他还没有一个愿意倾听他的人。  

He soon revealed to us that he used to play basketball and rugby in the Midwest (he and Katy had the same favorite basketball team), that he didn’t like the snow, and that he grew up doing a lot of farming.   

他很快向我们透露，他曾经在美国中西部打篮球和橄榄球（他和凯蒂最喜欢的篮球队是同一个），他不喜欢下雪，而且他从小就经常务农。

The nurses were puzzled at Mr. K’s changing demeanor.  

护士们对 K 先生举止的变化感到困惑。  

We were told that he asked about us on the days we didn’t come by, and that he had become nicer to the nurses.  

有人告诉我们，在我们没来的日子里，他都会问起我们，而且他对护士们也变得更好了。

Then, one day, we opened the door to his room — we were on such good terms that we didn’t even bother knocking — and it was empty.  

后来有一天，我们打开了他房间的门--我们关系很好，甚至都懒得敲门--里面空无一人。  

The bed was made with fresh linens, the open blinds letting the afternoon light pour in, the room overlooking the busy street below.   

床上铺着崭新的床单，打开的百叶窗让午后的阳光倾泻进来，房间里可以俯瞰楼下繁忙的街道。

“Where’s Mr. K?”  

"K先生在哪儿？"

A gruff nurse at the desk spoke, offering neither clue nor answer.   

服务台一位粗声粗气的护士开口了，既没有提供线索，也没有回答。

“He’s gone.”  

"他走了。"

Katy and I exchanged looks. I scoured the obituaries but couldn’t find his name.  

凯蒂和我交换了一下眼神。我翻遍了讣告，却找不到他的名字。  

I asked a friendlier nurse about it a few days later. He laughed.  

几天后，我向一位更友善的护士询问此事。他笑了

“Oh, he’s not _gone_ gone,” he said. “He comes and goes. I don’t know where he goes, but he’ll come back at some point.  

"哦，他还没走，"他说。"他来来去去。我不知道他去了哪里，但他总会回来的。  

But this time was different. He spoke very highly of you two.  

但这次不一样。他对你们俩评价很高。  

He’s usually eager to get out of here, but he almost seemed hesitant to leave.”  

他通常都很想离开这里，但这次他似乎犹豫不决。"

**\*\*\***

One of my more shocking moments at Hospice was a week-long affair that started on a Monday.  

我在安宁疗护中最令人震惊的时刻之一是在星期一开始的为期一周的事件。  

Katy and I visited with a new patient, Robbie.  

凯蒂和我去探望了一位新病人罗比。  

We were initially puzzled after talking with Robbie for a little while.  

在与罗比交谈了一会儿后，我们起初感到很困惑。  

He walked from one side of the room to the other, put some folded laundry away, made himself a cup of coffee, put his yoga mat up, and grabbed a book.  

他从房间的一侧走到另一侧，把叠好的衣服放好，给自己冲了一杯咖啡，铺上瑜伽垫，拿起一本书。  

His brother offered to help Robbie around, but Robbie waved him off.  

他哥哥想帮罗比四处走走，但罗比挥手拒绝了。

Katy finally wondered aloud. “Are you sure you’re in the right place?”  

凯蒂最后大声问道"你确定来对地方了吗？"

Robbie chuckled. “They said I’ll be dead in a week.”  

罗比笑着说"他们说我一周内就会死"

Katy and I audibly gasped in disbelief.  

凯蒂和我难以置信地喘着气。  

Robbie had neither the countenance nor the demeanor of a man on his deathbed.  

罗比既没有临终前的表情，也没有临终前的举止。  

He seemed vibrant and spry. “I’ve got stage four liver cancer.”  

他看起来充满活力，精神矍铄。"我得了第四期肝癌"

Still in disbelief, we both managed our apologies and well wishes, talking with him about his background and hometown.  

我们仍然难以置信，但还是向他表达了歉意和祝福，并和他聊了聊他的背景和家乡。  

We returned on Wednesday and found him in his bed.  

周三，我们回到医院，发现他躺在床上。  

He was less talkative, and had a general tiredness about him.  

他不太爱说话，整个人疲惫不堪。  

We dimmed his shades and spoke softly to him. We didn’t keep him for long.  

我们把他的窗帘调暗，轻声和他说话。我们没有让他久留。  

On Friday, he was largely unresponsive in his bed.  

星期五，他躺在床上基本没有反应。  

As we walked by his room, his brother and nurse were gently turning him onto his side, his breathing shallow.  

当我们路过他的房间时，他的哥哥和护士正轻轻地把他翻到一边，他的呼吸很浅。  

We gently poked into the doorway and gave his brother a sad little wave, taking a final look at Robbie.   

我们轻轻地探进门口，向他的哥哥悲伤地挥了挥手，最后看了一眼罗比。

On Monday, his room was empty, the bed made with fresh linens, the open blinds letting the afternoon light pour in, the room overlooking the busy street below.  

周一，他的房间空无一人，床上铺着崭新的床单，打开的百叶窗让午后的阳光倾泻进来，房间里可以俯瞰楼下繁忙的街道。

**\*\*\***

As Katy and I became more confident in our volunteering abilities, we would split up to visit different patients.  

随着凯蒂和我对自己的志愿服务能力越来越有信心，我们会分头去探望不同的病人。  

One patient in particular seemed immensely troubled, based on her patient entry.  

从病人的记录来看，有一位病人似乎遇到了很大的麻烦。  

Her notes column read something to the effect of “!!!ALWAYS RESUSCITATE!!!”  

她的备注栏里写着"！！！总是要抢救！！！"

We were hesitant to visit this patient, afraid that we might do more harm than good.  

我们犹豫着要不要去看望这位病人，生怕弊大于利。  

I asked the grandmotherly head nurse about the patient. She sighed.  

我向那位祖母级的护士长打听病人的情况。她叹了口气。

“Some folks come here, and they’re in complete denial.  

"有些人来到这里，他们完全拒绝接受治疗。  

They have to fast-track working through all of the emotional baggage that usually takes years to process.  

他们必须快速处理所有的情感包袱，而这些情感包袱通常需要数年才能处理完毕。  

They’ve resuscitated her several times already, and it did more harm than good.”  

他们已经抢救过她好几次了，但弊大于利。"

The nurse told me that this patient had confided in them that she was very wealthy, and that her wealth had bred greed amongst family members.  

护士告诉我，这位病人曾向他们吐露，她非常富有，而她的富有在家庭成员中滋生了贪婪。  

Her children and grandchildren only called to ask about their inheritance, instead of the woman’s condition.  

她的儿孙们只打电话来询问他们的遗产，而不是这位妇女的病情。

I was pulled out of my melancholic thoughts by the elderly nurse’s voice: “She’d probably like your company.”  

年长护士的声音把我从忧郁的思绪中拉了回来："她可能会喜欢你的陪伴。"

I must have been a strange sight to behold to the woman in denial.  

对于那个拒绝接受治疗的女人来说，我一定是个奇怪的人。  

Even though my parochial school already had modest uniforms, I found a way to make it even more modest, with dark leggings, and a large black headband that covered most of my hair.  

尽管我所在的教会学校已经有了简朴的校服，但我还是想办法让它变得更加简朴，我穿上了深色的紧身裤，戴上了黑色的大头巾，遮住了大部分头发。  

I entered the dimmed room uncertainly, and suddenly felt fear.  

我不确定地走进昏暗的房间，突然感到恐惧。  

It was a difficult sight to take in — the woman was in her late 80s with late stage mouth and throat cancer.  

眼前的景象让人难以接受--这位妇女已年过八旬，患有晚期口腔癌和喉癌。  

Most of her face from the nose down was covered and bandaged.  

她从鼻子以下的大部分脸部都被覆盖和包扎着。  

It was hard to tell where the body stopped and where machines and tubing began.  

很难分清身体在哪里停止，机器和管道在哪里开始。  

Her sunken eyes regarded me miserably, and she watched me with the fear of a wounded animal; it was hard to tell who was more uncertain about the other.  

她凹陷的眼睛凄苦地看着我，她像受伤的动物一样恐惧地看着我；很难分辨出谁对谁更不确定。  

I gently sat beside her bed, gazing at the elaborate rings that adorned her frail fingers.  

我轻轻地坐在她的床边，凝视着她纤弱手指上精致的戒指。  

Struggling to find something to say, I spoke softly.  

苦于找不到话说，我轻轻地开口了。

“I like your rings. They’re really pretty.”  

"我喜欢你的戒指它们真的很漂亮。"

She managed a faint, raspy, “Thank you.”  

她淡淡地说了声 "谢谢"

I whispered. “Are you scared?”  

我低声说"你害怕吗？"

She nodded.   

她点了点头

I managed back. “You’re not alone.”  

我又点了点头"你并不孤单"

While I originally intended for those words to imply that I was physically there in the present with her, I think that in that moment, they ended up meaning a lot more.  

虽然我原本想用这些话来暗示我和她在一起，但我觉得在那一刻，这些话的意义远不止于此。  

I was scared too. I was scared of a lot of things. My present and high school were scary.  

我也很害怕。我害怕很多事情。我的现在和高中都很可怕。  

My future and trying to figure out where I was going to go to college (and how I was supposed to pay for it) was scary.  

我的未来和我要去哪里上大学（以及如何支付学费）让我害怕。  

My past and seeing the faces of my dying loved ones transposed onto the faces of Hospice patients was scary.   

我的过去，看到我濒临死亡的亲人的脸被移植到临终关怀病人的脸上，这让我感到恐惧。

I didn’t realize that tears were dripping down my face until the frail, boney hand appeared in my line of sight, offering a crumpled tissue.  

直到一只瘦骨嶙峋的手出现在我的视线中，递给我一张皱巴巴的纸巾，我才意识到眼泪已经淌了下来。  

I graciously took it, quietly apologizing to her.  

我亲切地接过纸巾，低声向她道歉。  

We sat in silence together for some time, feeling one another’s contemplative presence.  

我们一起默默地坐了一会儿，感受着彼此的沉思。  

In saying very little, all that was needed had been said.  

说得很少，但该说的都说了。  

With a trembling hand, she took the pen from my volunteer clipboard.  

她用颤抖的手从我的志愿者剪贴板上拿起笔。  

Next to her name on the patient sheet, she wrote in shaky letters: “DNR.”  

在病历上她的名字旁边 她用颤抖的字体写道："DNR"。

Do not resuscitate.  

不要进行人工呼吸。

The next day when we returned, her room was empty, the bed made with fresh linens, the open blinds letting the afternoon light pour in, the room overlooking the busy street below.   

第二天，当我们回来时，她的房间空无一人，床上铺着崭新的床单，打开的百叶窗让午后的阳光倾泻进来，房间里可以俯瞰楼下繁忙的街道。

**\*\*\***

On one of my last days visiting Hospice, as the promise of summer encroached on the academic demands of the late spring, Katy and I were puzzled to find a large gathering outside of one of the patient rooms. A large group of disheveled individuals were gathered in a room and nearly blocking the hallway.   

在我访问临终关怀医院的最后几天里，当夏天的希望渐渐逼近暮春的学业需求时，凯蒂和我困惑地发现在一间病房外有一大群人聚集在一起。一大群衣衫不整的人聚集在一个房间里，几乎堵住了走廊。

As we drew closer, we found nearly two dozen homeless people crowding around an elderly man as he laid in his hospital bed.  

我们走近一看，发现近二十多名流浪汉正围着一位躺在病床上的老人。  

His breathing was raspy, shallow, and watery, making an almost knocking sound.  

他的呼吸急促、浅薄、含水，发出近乎敲击的声音。  

It was the death rattle common amongst individuals hours away from the end.  

这是人在临终前几小时常发出的 "嗒嗒 "声。  

The nurse in the hallway must have seen our furrowed brows at the sight of the crowd and spoke.  

走廊里的护士一定是看到了我们在人群中皱起的眉头，于是开口说道。

“He’s a local homeless man. He’s helped a lot of the other homeless folks in the neighborhood.  

"他是当地的流浪汉。他帮助了很多附近的流浪汉。  

They’ve been outside the hospital everyday asking if we knew where he was,” the nurse said.  

他们每天都在医院外面问我们是否知道他在哪里，"护士说。  

“When I told them he was here, they were heartbroken. He’s had dozens of visitors ever since.”  

"当我告诉他们他在这里时，他们都很伤心。从那以后，有几十个人来看他。"

Katy and I watched quietly from the hallway, as members of the homeless community fluffed the man’s pillow, brought him extra blankets, held his hands and cleaned his face.  

凯蒂和我在走廊里静静地看着，流浪汉社区的成员们给他的枕头弄松软，给他送去额外的毯子，握着他的手，给他擦脸。  

Some of them sang hymns softly.  

有些人还轻声唱起了赞美诗。

We exchanged a look, and I realized Katy and I both had the same observation.  

我们交换了一个眼神，我意识到凯蒂和我都有同样的看法。  

Sometimes, the people who have everything in life have nothing in death.  

有时候，生前拥有一切的人死后却一无所有。  

But sometimes the people who have nothing in life have everything that they could ever want in their final hours.  

但有时，生命中一无所有的人，在临终前却拥有了他们想要的一切。

**\*\*\***

So many patients and families shared with me their deepest desires, their darkest fears, and their sorest regrets that semester.  

在那个学期，许多病人和家属与我分享了他们最深切的渴望、最阴暗的恐惧和最痛心的遗憾。  

Even today, I’ve learned to take vacations while I still can.  

即使到了今天，我也学会了趁早度假。  

I’ve traveled to places I never would have imagined, and I’m about to complete my master’s degree in public service.  

我去了很多从未想象过的地方旅行，我即将完成我的公共服务硕士学位。  

I never go to bed angry.  

我从不生气地上床睡觉。  

I always say, “I love you,” to family and friends before hanging up the phone, just in case it’s the last time we talk.   

我总是在挂断电话前对家人和朋友说 "我爱你"，以防这是我们最后一次通话。

Ultimately, I didn’t enter the religious life.  

最终，我没有进入宗教生活。  

I’m still a devout Catholic, but I’m engaged to a devout Protestant.  

我仍然是一个虔诚的天主教徒，但我和一个虔诚的新教徒订婚了。  

Politically, we don’t always see eye to eye (sorry Mr. K).  

在政治上，我们并不总是意见一致（对不起，K 先生）。  

But we cherish our time together, and I cherish my time with those around me.  

但我们珍惜在一起的时光，我也珍惜与身边人相处的时光。  

I choose my words wisely with both friend and foe.  

无论是对朋友还是对敌人，我都会明智地选择言辞。  

There have been times that I’ve turned in a less than perfect assignment in order to spend more time with my family instead, because I saw first hand that when people are lying in their deathbeds, they remember their parents and siblings and spouses and children and pets — not their high school geometry assignment or that one bad day at work 30 years ago.  

有好几次，我为了花更多的时间陪伴家人，交了一份不那么完美的作业，因为我亲眼看到，当人们躺在病床上时，他们记得的是自己的父母、兄弟姐妹、配偶、孩子和宠物，而不是高中的几何作业或 30 年前工作中糟糕的一天。  

I eat my cake today, because I might not be there to eat it tomorrow.  

我今天吃我的蛋糕，因为明天我可能就吃不到了。

I’ve learned that it is so important not to get lost in the weeds of everyday life.  

我已经明白，不要迷失在日常生活的杂草中是多么重要。  

If today sucked, oh well. There’s always tomorrow.  

如果今天很糟糕，没关系。明天总会到来。  

And at least on our bad days, we still have people around us who love us, help us, and want the best for us.  

至少在糟糕的日子里，我们身边还有爱我们、帮助我们、希望我们过得最好的人。  

I’ve learned to savor each moment, and I’ve learned to be thankful, because things can very quickly change.    

我学会了品味每一刻，学会了感恩，因为一切都会瞬息万变。

But most importantly, I’ve learned that when I leave this earth for a better home someday, the only thing I’ll take is what I gave away.  

但最重要的是，我学会了，当我有一天离开这个世界，前往一个更好的家园时，我唯一要带走的就是我所付出的一切。

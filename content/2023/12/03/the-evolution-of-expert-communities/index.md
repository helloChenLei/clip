Much has been written about the usual evolution of general-interest online communities.  

关于一般兴趣在线社区的演变已经有很多文章写过。  

Less attention has been paid to the dynamics of more specialized, expert-led forums — and the unique if ultimately destructive role of expertise.  

对于更专业、由专家领导的论坛的动态以及专业知识的独特但最终具有破坏性的作用，人们关注较少。

Over the past 25 years, I participated in dozens of such groups.  

在过去的25年里，我参与了数十个这样的群体。  

The forums ranged from 200 to 200,000 members, have been hosted on a variety of platforms, and have dealt with topics ranging from electronic circuit design, to emergency preparedness, to collectible antiques.  

这些论坛的成员人数从200人到20万人不等，托管在各种平台上，涉及的主题从电子电路设计到应急准备再到收藏古董等各种各样。  

In almost every instance, they followed the same trajectory — so today, I’d like to put forward a general lifecycle model for expert-led communities.  

几乎每一个例子都遵循相同的轨迹，因此今天，我想提出一个专家领导的社区的一般生命周期模型。

Most online communities begin the same way: as an offshoot of another, less specialized online group, or as an ad-hoc forum for local hobbyists.  

大多数在线社区都以相同的方式开始：作为另一个不太专业的在线群体的分支，或者作为本地爱好者的临时论坛。

At the first stage of growth, this new community is defined mainly by the hunger for knowledge.  

在成长的第一阶段，这个新社区主要以对知识的渴望为特征。  

Its members are excited to compare notes and share what they learn.  

社区成员们兴奋地交流心得并分享所学。  

There is no well-defined pecking order and there are no stupid questions; all newcomers are greeted with open arms and patiently tutored along the way.  

这里没有明确的等级制度，也没有愚蠢的问题；所有新人都受到热情的欢迎，并耐心地指导他们前进。

Within the first couple of months, the group’s epistemological consensus begins to emerge, often dictated by the group’s most active or most knowledgeable participants.  

在最初的几个月内，群体的认识共识开始形成，通常由群体中最活跃或最有知识的成员主导。  

The consensus defines the correct way to learn the craft, outlines a set of technology preferences, and perhaps demands loyalty to specific brands.  

这个共识定义了学习技艺的正确方式，概述了一套技术偏好，并可能要求对特定品牌的忠诚。  

At this point, dissenting views begin to be marginalized, although usually in a subtle and jovial way.  

此时，持不同意见的观点开始被边缘化，尽管通常以微妙而欢快的方式。

Successful online communities usually don’t plateau at stage 1. Instead, the group eventually reaches a threshold of visibility that triggers a prolonged period of explosive growth.  

成功的在线社区通常不会停留在第一阶段。相反，群体最终会达到一个能触发持续爆炸性增长的能见度阈值。  

The exposure can happen organically or can be triggered by external events; for example, the _/r/preppers_ community on Reddit quintupled in size in the wake of COVID-19.  

这种曝光可以自然发生，也可以由外部事件触发；例如，在COVID-19疫情爆发后，Reddit上的/r/preppers社区的规模增加了五倍。

The uncontrolled growth is initially welcomed, but it soon becomes a liability: the never-ending stream of repetitive beginner questions wears down the core contributors to the group.  

不受控制的增长最初受到欢迎，但很快变成了一个负担：源源不断的重复初学者问题使核心贡献者疲惫不堪。  

Some leave; others inevitably pen diatribes decrying the decline in discussion quality and calling for a new set of norms.  

一些人离开；其他人不可避免地写下长篇抨击，谴责讨论质量的下降，并呼吁建立新的规范。

The next stage begins with the development of elaborate rules meant to restore order in the community.  

下一个阶段开始时，制定了复杂的规则，旨在恢复社区秩序。  

To further this goal, seasoned members develop lengthy FAQs and create strict, multi-page posting guidelines.  

为了实现这个目标，经验丰富的成员制定了详尽的常见问题解答和严格的多页发布指南。

These good-faith measures usually fail.  

这些善意的措施通常失败。  

Many newcomers are disinclined to scroll through pages of fine print; others find the canned answers unsatisfying or hard to parse.  

许多新手不愿意浏览几页的细则；其他人发现标准答案令人不满意或难以理解。  

Core members of the forum usually take such defiance as a slight.  

论坛的核心成员通常会将这种抵抗视为一种轻蔑。  

So begins the period of “noob sniping:” the ridiculing and summary punishment of good-faith participants who do not follow the protocol.  

于是开始了“新手狙击”的时期：对善意参与者进行嘲笑和总结性惩罚，因为他们没有遵守协议。  

The tone shifts palatably; gatekeeping, snide remarks, and permanent bans for minor offenses become commonplace.  

氛围明显变得不好，守门人行为、讽刺的言辞以及对轻微违规的永久封禁变得司空见惯。

Under siege, key members of the forum close ranks.  

在围困之下，论坛的核心成员紧密团结起来。  

The tolerance for dissent decreases; those with a different vision for the group are driven away.  

对异议的容忍度降低，那些对团体有不同愿景的人被驱逐出去。  

Schisms and purges within the administrator community commonly happen at this point, too.  

在管理员社区内部，分裂和清洗现象通常也会在这个时候发生。

The crackdowns usually succeed in stemming the flow of inexperienced participants — but they also deal a fatal blow to meaningful growth.  

镇压通常能够成功地遏制经验不足的参与者的涌入，但同时也对有意义的增长造成了致命打击。  

The reduction in noise soon exposes an uncomfortable truth: several years in, there are relatively few important topics left for the core participants to discuss.  

噪音的减少很快暴露出一个令人不悦的事实：几年过去了，核心参与者所能讨论的重要话题相对较少。  

Industry headlines and product announcements provide momentary relief, but aren’t enough to give a sense of purpose to the group.  

行业头条和产品发布提供了暂时的缓解，但无法给团体带来目标感。

In response to the continued attrition of long-time members, the community begins to lean more heavily on esoteric tangents, meta discussions, and insider humor — sometimes of the offensive variety.  

为了应对长期成员的持续流失，社区开始更加依赖深奥的离题讨论、元话题和内部幽默，有时还涉及冒犯性内容。  

The phenomenon can be thought of as trying to save a marriage by spicing things up.  

这种现象可以被看作是通过增加情趣来挽救婚姻。

Eventually, the forum reaches its end state.  

最终，论坛达到了它的终结状态。  

Stuck on a now-outmoded platform, it is no longer a natural destination for those seeking expert advice.  

陷入了一个已经过时的平台，它不再是寻求专家建议的自然去处。  

Most of the less committed participants drop out, leaving a small core team of folks who have known each other for a decade or more.  

大多数不太投入的参与者退出了，只剩下一个小团队，他们已经认识彼此十年甚至更久了。

Off-topic banter takes center stage: the most active threads deal with politics, health issues, divorces, and deaths.  

离题的闲聊成为主角：最活跃的帖子涉及政治、健康问题、离婚和死亡。  

When on-topic conversations happen, they usually revolve around the supposed ignorance of the new breed of experts and the superiority of the old way of doing things.  

当有关主题的对话发生时，它们通常围绕着新一代专家的所谓无知和旧的做事方式的优越性展开。

I dread to call it a decline: it’s a metamorphosis that reflects the shifting priorities of the members of the community — and naturally makes room for new communities to thrive.  

我不敢称之为衰落：这是一种变形，反映了社区成员的优先事项的转变，并自然地为新的社区腾出了空间。

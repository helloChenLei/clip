A few months ago, I wrote a piece about creating a [power down sequence](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/how-to-power-down-to-reclaim-your-life) to separate your work from your personal life each evening. The idea was to create a fixed sequence of events that mentally and physically mark the end of your professional day (and your transition into your personal time).  

几个月前，我写了一篇关于创建一个断电序列以在每晚将您的工作与个人生活分开的文章。这个想法是创造一个固定的事件序列，在精神上和身体上标志着你职业一天的结束（以及你向个人时间的过渡）。

I received hundreds of replies from readers who had implemented the strategy with great success—most had found real value in establishing a ritual around shutting down their professional mindset at the end of each day.  

我收到了成百上千的读者回复，他们实施了该策略并取得了巨大成功——大多数人发现在每天结束时建立一种围绕关闭他们的专业思维的习惯是真正有价值的。

Around the time of that post, having seen the value of the power down sequence in my own life, I started experimenting with creating its mirror image: The Boot Up Sequence.  

在那篇文章的前后，我看到了断电序列在我自己生活中的价值，开始尝试创建它的镜像：启动序列。

In today's piece, I'd like to talk about the Boot Up Sequence—what it is, why it will 10x your productivity, and how to build your own.  

在今天的文章中，我想谈谈启动序列——它是什么，为什么它会使您的工作效率提高 10 倍，以及如何构建您自己的序列。

## The Boot Up Sequence  

启动顺序

If you're like me, when you turn on your computer, you stare at the screen impatiently while it loads to your home screen.  

如果你像我一样，当你打开电脑时，当它加载到你的主屏幕时，你会不耐烦地盯着屏幕。

But under the surface, the computer is doing something very important: It's running a boot up sequence, which is simply a fixed set of operations that the computer performs when it is switched on to initiate and prepare the operating system for use.  

但在表面之下，计算机正在做一些非常重要的事情：它正在运行启动序列，这只是计算机在开机时执行的一组固定操作，以启动和准备操作系统以供使用。  

This sequence ensures the operating system is engaged appropriately and ready for the onslought of task processing that the user is likely to put it through during the upcoming session.  

此顺序确保操作系统适当参与并准备好迎接用户可能在即将到来的会话期间完成的任务处理。

We are really no different than this computer—to function optimally as we process important tasks, we need to prime and prepare our operating system for use.  

我们实际上与这台计算机没有什么不同——为了在处理重要任务时发挥最佳功能，我们需要准备好我们的操作系统以供使用。

We need a Boot Up Sequence!  

我们需要启动序列！

The Boot Up Sequence is a fixed set of actions and environmental cues that mentally and physically mark the start of your work session.  

启动顺序是一组固定的动作和环境提示，在精神上和身体上标志着您工作会议的开始。

While it can be used for any work session, I find it particularly impactful and valuable in priming for a deep work session (daily focused work on the "most important thing").  

虽然它可以用于任何工作会议，但我发现它在启动深度工作会议（每天专注于“最重要的事情”）方面特别有影响力和价值。

The sequence becomes a doorway to the "flow" that we all want to enter.  

序列成为我们都想进入的“流程”的门户。

An effective, repeatable Boot Up Sequence will allow you to 10x your productivity by enabling you to quickly and consistently enter your flow state and execute deep, focused work on your most important projects.  

有效、可重复的启动顺序将使您能够快速、持续地进入心流状态，并在最重要的项目上执行深入、专注的工作，从而使您的工作效率提高 10 倍。

Let's talk about how to build your Boot Up Sequence (alongside an illustrative example of mine)...  

让我们谈谈如何构建您的启动序列（以及我的说明性示例）...

## The 5 Senses of the Sequence  

序列的 5 种感觉

When _craft_ing my Boot Up Sequence, I decided to build it around the five core senses that would be engaged:  

在制作我的启动序列时，我决定围绕将要参与的五种核心感官来构建它：

-   Touch: What movement/body action you engaged in prior to start.  
    
    触摸：开始之前您进行了哪些运动/身体动作。
-   Taste: What you're drinking, chewing on, or snacking on.  
    
    味道：您正在喝什么、咀嚼什么或吃什么。
-   Sight: What you see in your environment.  
    
    视线：您在环境中看到的东西。
-   Sound: What you hear in your environment.  
    
    声音：您在环境中听到的声音。
-   Smell: What you smell in your environment.  
    
    气味：您在环境中闻到的气味。

Using this simple framing, I built a Boot Up Sequence that looks like this:  

使用这个简单的框架，我构建了一个如下所示的启动序列：

-   Touch: Prior to sitting down for a deep work session, I either (a) go for a 5-minute walk outside or (b) take a 3-minute ice bath. Both of these actions unlock my creative energy and prime my system.  
    
    触摸：在坐下来进行深度工作之前，我要么 (a) 到户外散步 5 分钟，要么 (b) 洗个 3 分钟的冰浴。这两个动作都释放了我的创造力并启动了我的系统。
-   Taste: I always have a large black cold brew coffee (preferably Dunkin' Donuts!) that I will sip on prior to the start of the session and have next to me during the session. The caffeine helps, but it's mostly psychological, as I rarely finish the drink.  
    
    口味：我总是喝一大杯黑色冷萃咖啡（最好是 Dunkin' Donuts！），我会在课程开始前喝一口，并在课程期间放在我旁边。咖啡因有帮助，但主要是心理作用，因为我很少喝完。
-   Sight: My writing desk faces a window with dark walls on my sides, some plants, and neutral art.  
    
    视线：我的写字台面向一扇窗户，两侧是深色墙壁、一些植物和中性艺术。
-   Sound: I listen to a Spotify playlist called Classical Essentials or an app called BrainWave Binaural Programs.  
    
    声音：我听一个名为 Classical Essentials 的 Spotify 播放列表或一个名为 BrainWave Binaural Programs 的应用程序。
-   Smell: I love the smell of wood, so my writing nook has cedarwood/sandalwood candles or oils. Both have been shown to help with focus.  
    
    气味：我喜欢木头的味道，所以我的写作角落里有雪松/檀香蜡烛或油。两者都被证明有助于集中注意力。

I typically go through this sequence twice each day—once first thing in the morning (around 530am) when I start my first deep creative session and once in the afternoon after lunch when I start my second deep work session.  

我通常每天两次完成这个序列——一次是在早上的第一件事（早上 530 点左右）开始我的第一次深度创意会议时，一次是在午饭后的下午开始我的第二次深度工作会议时。  

Going through this sequence has become an incredibly effective routine that gets me into the appropriate state to enter my flow.  

完成这个序列已经成为一个非常有效的例行程序，它让我进入适当的状态以进入我的流程。

To build your sequence, sit down and walk through each of the five senses.  

要构建您的序列，请坐下来并通过五种感官中的每一种。

For each sense, think about a time when you were truly in flow: How was that sense engaged during (or before) that session? Write down all of the different ways these senses were engaged in prior periods of flow to give you a sense of the range of options at your disposal.  

对于每一种感觉，想一想您真正处于心流状态的时间：在该会话期间（或之前），这种感觉是如何参与的？写下这些感官在之前的心流阶段的所有不同方式，让您了解可供您选择的选项范围。

Select the option for each sense that is most actionable and repeatable. If you were in flow state while sitting at a cafe overlooking Positano, Italy while sipping $20 espresso, that's probably not repeatable (if it is, please trade lives with me!).  

为每种感觉选择最可操作和可重复的选项。如果你坐在一家俯瞰意大利波西塔诺的咖啡馆里喝着 20 美元的浓咖啡时处于心流状态，那可能是不可重复的（如果是，请和我交换生活！）。  

If you were in flow state while sitting at your local coffee shop and listening to your favorite house track, that's probably quite repeatable.  

如果你坐在当地的咖啡店里听你最喜欢的 house 曲目时处于心流状态，那可能是很容易重复的。

Once you've established your actionable, repeatable options for each of the five senses, write down your full Boot Up Sequence. Until it becomes a habit, check the items off the list as you "boot up" for a deep work session.  

一旦你为五种感官中的每一种建立了可操作的、可重复的选项，写下你的完整启动顺序。直到它成为一种习惯，在你“启动”深度工作会议时，从列表中勾选项目。

## The 3/5 Rule  

3/5规则

In our perfect world, we establish this Boot Up Sequence and are able to do it every single day.  

在我们的完美世界中，我们建立了这个启动序列并且能够每天都这样做。

Unfortunately, we don't always live in our perfect world. Sometimes life gets in the way—maybe it's work or personal travel, family challenges, or something random that throws you out of your routine. The point is that we need a way to execute despite imperfect circumstances.  

不幸的是，我们并不总是生活在完美的世界中。有时生活会遇到阻碍——也许是工作或个人旅行、家庭挑战，或者是一些随机事件让你脱离了日常生活。关键是我们需要一种在不完美的情况下执行的方法。

Enter my 3/5 Rule:  

输入我的 3/5 规则：

If you aren't able to execute your full, ideal Boot Up Sequence, simply aim to nail 3 out of the 5 senses of the sequence.  

如果您无法执行完整、理想的启动序列，只需瞄准序列的 5 种感官中的 3 种。  

My experience suggests that 3 out of 5 is achievable under a variety of circumstances, and it's enough to create the mental and physical entryway into your flow.  

我的经验表明，在各种情况下，5 分之 3 是可以实现的，这足以为你的心流创造精神和身体的入口。

For example, say I'm on the road for an unexpected work trip that my boss forced me to take at the last minute. I'm in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and need to get an important presentation done.  

例如，假设我正在路上进行意外的工作旅行，我的老板在最后一刻强迫我去。我在一个偏僻的旅馆里，需要完成一个重要的演示。

There are several things that are clearly out of my control, but let's play by the 3/5 Rule:  

有几件事显然是我无法控制的，但让我们按照 3/5 规则来玩：

-   Touch: I probably can't do an ice bath, but I can definitely do a quick 5-minute walk outside to engage my body and get my creative energy flowing.  
    
    触摸：我可能无法进行冰浴，但我绝对可以在室外快速步行 5 分钟，让我的身体活动起来，让我的创造力流动起来。
-   Taste: I may not be able to get my favorite coffee, but I can definitely get some form of coffee (and pour it over some ice) to simulate it.  
    
    味道：我可能无法得到我最喜欢的咖啡，但我绝对可以得到某种形式的咖啡（并倒在一些冰上）来模拟它。
-   Sight: My options are ugly wallpapered hotel room or crowded hotel lobby. Neither one is great.  
    
    视线：我的选择是贴着丑陋壁纸的酒店房间或拥挤的酒店大堂。没有一个是伟大的。
-   Sound: As long as I have my phone and headphones with me, I can hit the sounds.  
    
    声音：只要我有手机和耳机，我就能发出声音。
-   Smell: "Old Hotel Must" is not on the list of most successful perfumes for a reason.  
    
    气味：“Old Hotel Must”不在最成功的香水名单上是有原因的。

Sight and Smell are out, but I am in control of Touch, Taste, and Sound. I have 3 out of 5 and am able to make it work. It's not my perfect Boot Up Sequence, but it's good enough.  

视觉和嗅觉都消失了，但我可以控制触觉、味觉和声音。我有 5 个中的 3 个并且能够使它工作。这不是我完美的启动顺序，但已经足够好了。

The point of the 3/5 Rule is simple: It's not always going to be perfect, but if you focus on the controllables, you can make the most of every deep work session.  

3/5 法则的要点很简单：它并不总是完美的，但如果你专注于可控因素，你就可以充分利用每一次深度工作。

## Booting Up  

开机

As I began working on my [book project](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1576559947852427264?s=20) this year, I needed a way to consistently find my flow. The Boot Up Sequence has allowed me to quickly, and consistently enter that mode and produce higher quality output than I imagined possible.  

当我今年开始着手我的图书项目时，我需要一种方法来始终如一地找到我的心流。启动顺序让我能够快速、持续地进入该模式，并产生比我想象的更高质量的输出。

If you're searching for a way to make more progress on your "most important thing", I'd encourage you to try building out and executing on a Boot Up Sequence. I'm confident it will become a cheat code in your arsenal.  

如果您正在寻找一种在“最重要的事情”上取得更多进展的方法，我鼓励您尝试构建并执行启动序列。我相信它会成为您武器库中的作弊代码。

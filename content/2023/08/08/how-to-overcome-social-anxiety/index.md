## Need to know 需要了解

A bright, hardworking student is doing poorly in his communications class. Participation counts for 25 per cent of his grade, but he hasn’t spoken up in class since the semester started because he’s worried he’ll sound stupid.  

一名聪明、勤奋的学生在通信课上成绩很差。课堂参与占他成绩的 25%，但自从学期开始，他就没有在课堂上发言过，因为他担心自己的发言会很愚蠢。

What unites each of these people? Social anxiety. If any of these descriptions resonate with you, perhaps you too live with social anxiety.  

是什么将这些人联系在一起？社交焦虑。如果这些描述能引起你的共鸣，也许你也有社交焦虑症。  

This Guide will help you understand this condition and learn how to address it.  

本指南将帮助您了解这种情况，并学习如何应对。

**Understand the causes of social anxiety  

了解社交焦虑的原因**

At its core, social anxiety is a fear of negative evaluation and rejection.  

社交焦虑的核心是害怕负面评价和拒绝。  

When you feel socially anxious, you worry about what others think of you and hope you are making a good impression.  

当你感到社交焦虑时，你会担心别人对你的看法，希望自己给别人留下好印象。

Like most emotions, anxiety tries to help you. Anxiety is your brain’s way of alerting you to a looming threat. Think: snake slithering up your arm.  

与大多数情绪一样，焦虑也试图帮助你。焦虑是大脑提醒你面临威胁的一种方式。想想：蛇在你的手臂上滑行。  

Social anxiety is designed to do the same thing: alert you to _social_ threats. Social threats are anything that involves you being rejected, such as being made fun of or ousted from a group.  

社交焦虑的目的也是一样的：提醒你注意社交威胁。社交威胁是指任何涉及你被拒绝的事情，比如被取笑或被赶出某个团体。  

When social anxiety bubbles up, it says: ‘Hey, there’s a good chance you might be rejected right now.’ To minimise the chances of rejection, you tune in to your situation.  

当社交焦虑出现时，它会说：'嘿，你现在很有可能被拒绝。为了把被拒绝的几率降到最低，你要调整好自己的状态。  

You scan the room looking for disapproving faces; you analyse how people are acting; you hyperfocus on your posture, speech and facial expressions.  

你会扫视房间，寻找不赞同的面孔；你会分析别人的行为举止；你会过度关注自己的姿势、言语和面部表情。  

After this quick assessment, you try to match your behaviour to fit in and avoid rejection. Voilà! Thank you, social anxiety.  

在快速评估之后，你会努力调整自己的行为，以适应环境，避免被拒绝。就是这样！谢谢你，社交焦虑症。

If social anxiety were a person, you could say they have good intentions. But sometimes, social anxiety gets it wrong.  

如果社交焦虑是一个人，你可以说他们是出于好意。但有时，社交焦虑症也会出错。  

This happens when social anxiety sends alarm bells for social threats that are not actually there – or worse, it’s a nonstop alarm bell everywhere you go.  

当社交焦虑为实际上并不存在的社交威胁敲响警钟时，就会出现这种情况--更糟糕的是，你走到哪里，它都会不停地敲响警钟。

You might be thinking: ‘I don’t socialise much, but I’m not bothered by it. I just prefer to be alone.’ This is introversion and it’s different from social anxiety.  

你可能会想：'我不太喜欢社交，但我并不为此烦恼。我只是喜欢独处。这就是内向，与社交焦虑不同。  

Introversion is a personality trait that is more about your _preference_ for socialising: how often, with whom, big or small groups, and so on. In contrast, social anxiety is about the _fear_ of socialising. You can be introverted with or without social anxiety, and you can have social anxiety with or without introversion.  

内向是一种性格特征，更多的是指你对社交的偏好：社交的频率、社交对象、大群体还是小群体等等。相比之下，社交焦虑则是对社交的恐惧。你可以内向，也可以没有社交焦虑；你可以有社交焦虑，也可以没有内向。  

Social anxiety is also different from shyness, which is when you feel some uneasiness or reservation in a social setting.  

社交焦虑也不同于害羞，害羞是指在社交场合感到不安或有所保留。  

It is common to feel shy occasionally, such as when you meet new people or perform in front of others.  

偶尔感到害羞是很正常的，比如当你遇到新朋友或在别人面前表演时。  

If you don’t struggle with social anxiety, you can usually adapt quickly when shyness shows up and still enjoy the social interaction.  

如果你没有社交焦虑症，当害羞出现时，你通常可以很快适应，并仍然享受社交互动。

Social anxiety gets in the way of building strong social relationships, performing to the best of your ability at school and work, and feeling comfortable in your own skin.  

社交焦虑会妨碍你建立稳固的社交关系，妨碍你在学校和工作中尽情发挥自己的能力，妨碍你感到自在。  

It can also lead to other mental health conditions, such as substance abuse, depression and even suicide.  

它还可能导致其他心理健康问题，如药物滥用、抑郁甚至自杀。

People who feel very anxious in many social situations might be struggling with social anxiety disorder (SAD).  

在许多社交场合都感到非常焦虑的人可能患有社交焦虑症（SAD）。  

SAD involves persistent and distressing anxiety in numerous social situations, such as:  

SAD 包括在许多社交场合中持续存在的令人痛苦的焦虑，例如：

-   giving a presentation; 发表演讲；
-   performing in front of others;  
    
    在别人面前表演
-   interacting with strangers;  
    
    与陌生人交流
-   going on a date; 去约会
-   small talk; or 闲聊；或
-   eating or drinking in front of others.  
    
    在他人面前吃喝。

When you have SAD, these everyday social situations feel like opportunities to fail.  

当你患有 SAD 时，这些日常的社交场合就会让你觉得是失败的机会。  

Interacting with a stranger opens the door to saying something foolish; going on a date skyrockets your chances of getting rejected; small talk could lead to an awkward silence or stumbling on your words; and eating and drinking in front of others feels like a performance where your every sip and chew is under a magnifying glass.  

与陌生人打交道容易说傻话；约会会增加被拒绝的几率；闲聊可能导致尴尬的沉默或说话磕磕绊绊；在别人面前吃喝感觉就像一场表演，你的每一口咀嚼都在放大镜下。

As a result of this anxiety, people with SAD avoid initiating or participating in social interactions – even if the situations are important to them.  

由于这种焦虑，SAD 患者会避免发起或参与社交互动，即使这些场合对他们很重要。  

To be diagnosed with SAD according to formal psychiatric criteria, you must endorse each of the following symptoms:  

要根据正式的精神病学标准被诊断为 SAD，您必须认可以下每一项症状：

-   marked, persistent fear of social situations;  
    
    明显、持续地害怕社交场合；
-   feared social situations almost always elicit anxiety;  
    
    可怕的社交场合几乎总是会引起焦虑；
-   fear about the situation is out of proportion to the actual threat;  
    
    对局势的恐惧与实际威胁不成比例；
-   the situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety;  
    
    在这种情况下，他们会回避或带着强烈的焦虑去忍受；
-   your anxiety and/or avoidance causes impairment in important life areas; and  
    
    您的焦虑和/或回避导致您在重要的生活领域受到损害；以及
-   symptoms have been present for at least six months.  
    
    症状出现至少六个月。

SAD is one of the most common mental illnesses in the world. Roughly 4 per cent of people around the world will meet these diagnostic criteria at some point in their lives. Based on current population estimates of 8 billion, this is roughly 320 million people!  

自闭症是世界上最常见的精神疾病之一。全世界大约有 4% 的人在一生中的某个阶段会符合这些诊断标准。根据目前 80 亿人口的估计，这大约是 3.2 亿人！

Here’s the good news: social anxiety is very treatable. Even if social anxiety bubbles up only occasionally or impacts a single area of your life, there are effective tools to combat it.  

好消息是：社交焦虑是可以治疗的。即使社交焦虑只是偶尔出现，或者只影响到你生活中的一个方面，也有有效的方法来对付它。

During my years as a clinician, including a year-long rotation at Harvard Medical School’s McLean psychiatric hospital, I worked with many teens and adults with social anxiety.  

在我担任临床医生的这些年里，包括在哈佛医学院麦克莱恩精神病院轮转一年期间，我曾与许多患有社交焦虑症的青少年和成年人共事。  

I was often struck by the uniqueness of each person’s situation – the origins of their social anxiety, how it showed up for them, and the ways they coped.  

我常常被每个人的独特情况所震撼--他们社交焦虑的起源、他们是如何表现出来的，以及他们应对的方法。  

But I was even more struck by how quickly people got better using the same tried-and-true treatment tools.  

但更让我印象深刻的是，人们使用同样的屡试不爽的治疗工具后，病情很快就好转了。  

Even for those with social anxiety so devastating that they were no longer leaving their home, they got better. To be clear, addressing social anxiety is no walk in the park.  

即使是那些社交焦虑严重到足不出户的人，他们的情况也有所好转。需要明确的是，解决社交焦虑并不是一件轻而易举的事情。  

It takes courage to face your fears head-on.  

直面恐惧需要勇气。  

But with a little effort and support, you might be surprised by how quickly you start to feel better – and start living the life you want to live.  

但是，只要付出一点努力并得到支持，你可能会惊讶地发现自己很快就会感觉好起来，并开始过上自己想要的生活。

## What to do 该怎么做

**Identify your goals 确定目标**

Goals will guide you as you work through your social anxiety, so a good place to start is to think about what matters to you.  

在你克服社交焦虑的过程中，目标会给你指引方向，所以一个好的开始就是想想什么对你来说是最重要的。  

Identify areas of your social life that you want to improve, such as:  

确定您想要改善的社交生活领域，例如

-   finding a romantic partner;  
    
    寻找浪漫伴侣
-   making more friends; 交更多的朋友
-   speaking up more in group settings;  
    
    在集体场合多发言；
-   being more assertive; or 更加自信；或
-   meeting new people. 认识新朋友

Reminding yourself of your ‘why’ (your goals) helps you stay motivated and keep at it.  

提醒自己 "为什么"（你的目标）有助于你保持动力并坚持下去。

**Break unhelpful thinking habits  

打破无益的思维习惯**

Social anxiety tricks you into believing that certain _situations_ cause anxiety, but in reality, your _thoughts_ about the situations drive your anxiety. The next step is therefore to consider and challenge your fearful thoughts.  

社交焦虑会欺骗你，让你相信某些情况会导致焦虑，但实际上，是你对这些情况的想法导致了你的焦虑。因此，下一步就是思考并挑战你的恐惧想法。

Imagine that you’re about to meet a co-worker for lunch:  

想象一下，您正准备与同事共进午餐：

> Scenario 1. You think: ‘I’m eager to get to know them better!’ When you walk into the restaurant, you feel excited. You update each other on new happenings in your lives.  
> 
> 情景 1.你想："我渴望更好地了解他们！"。当你们走进餐厅时，你们感到很兴奋。你们向对方介绍自己生活中发生的新鲜事。  
> 
> You leave feeling grateful.  
> 
> 你离开时会心存感激。

> Scenario 2. You think: ‘I have nothing interesting to say.’ When you walk into the restaurant, you feel anxious. You hold back during the conversation.  
> 
> 情景 2.你想："我没有什么有趣的话要说。当你走进餐厅时，你感到焦虑不安。在交谈过程中，你会有所保留。  
> 
> You leave feeling embarrassed.  
> 
> 你离开时觉得很尴尬。

In these scenarios, the situation (lunch with a co-worker) is identical, but your thoughts about the event drastically differ.  

在这些情景中，情况（与同事共进午餐）是相同的，但你们对事件的想法却大相径庭。  

These thoughts drive your behaviour (what you said during the conversation), and your feelings during and after.  

这些想法会驱动你的行为（你在谈话中说了什么），以及你在谈话中和谈话后的感受。

When you’re struggling with social anxiety, your social outings tend to resemble Scenario 2. You might view social events as unequivocally awful (‘Nothing went right’) or view ambiguous situations as catastrophes (‘My classmates must hate me because they didn’t include me in a group chat’).  

当你在社交焦虑中挣扎时，你的社交活动往往与情景 2 相似。你可能会把社交活动看得非常糟糕（"没有一件事是顺利的"），或者把模棱两可的情况视为灾难（"我的同学一定很讨厌我，因为他们没有让我参加群聊"）。

These negative thinking patterns can occur before, during and after social situations.  

这些负面思维模式可能出现在社交场合之前、期间和之后。  

Even if your negative thoughts are sometimes factually correct, playing them on repeat usually just amplifies your anxiety and keeps you stuck in a cycle of avoidance.  

即使你的消极想法有时在事实上是正确的，但重复播放这些想法通常只会放大你的焦虑，让你陷入逃避的恶性循环。  

Here’s how to break them:  

下面介绍如何破解它们：

-   **Describe a social situation in which you felt anxious.** Be specific by detailing who, what, when and where, such as: _Party with Sarah at Bentley’s Bar on Friday night. I am standing alone in the corner sipping my drink._  
    
    描述你感到焦虑的社交场合。请具体描述谁、做什么、何时何地，例如周五晚上和莎拉在本特利酒吧聚会。我独自站在角落里喝着饮料。
-   **Describe your negative thoughts.** _I’m going to make a fool of myself._  
    
    描述你的消极想法。我要出丑了。
-   **Question the evidence.** Be honest with yourself: what data supports or contradicts your negative thoughts?  
    
    质疑证据。诚实地面对自己：哪些数据支持或反驳了你的消极想法？  
    
    Tip: recalling how you navigated similar situations in the past helps you more objectively weigh the evidence of your current situation.  
    
    小贴士：回忆一下你过去是如何处理类似情况的，有助于你更客观地权衡当前情况的证据。

> Evidence that supports the thought ‘I’m going to make a fool of myself’: _People have made fun of me before._ Or, _When I’m nervous, I have a hard time expressing myself._  
> 
> 支持'我会出丑'这一想法的证据：以前有人取笑过我。或者，当我紧张时，我很难表达自己。

> Evidence that contradicts the thought ‘I’m going to make a fool of myself’: _I don’t know for sure if I will do something foolish because I don’t have a crystal ball. Anything could happen._ Or: _I’m in control of my actions. I can choose to say or do certain things that might land well._ Or: _I’ve handled similar social situations well in the past._  
> 
> 与'我会出丑'的想法相矛盾的证据：我不确定自己是否会做傻事，因为我没有水晶球。任何事情都有可能发生。或者：我能控制自己的行为。我可以选择说某些话或做某些事，这样可能会有好结果。或者：我过去曾很好地处理过类似的社交场合。

-   **Generate a balanced alternative.** How else could you think about this situation? Come up with balanced thoughts that take into account the evidence you listed above and what you want to achieve from the situation.  
    
    提出一个平衡的替代方案。你还可以如何看待这种情况？提出平衡的想法，考虑到你上面列出的证据以及你想从这种情况中实现的目标。  
    
    Tip: be realistic. The quickest way for this to fail is by lying to yourself. _I might say something awkward, which would be really embarrassing. But even if I make a few awkward comments, I could also say something funny or interesting.  
    
    It’s certainly possible that I make a complete fool of myself. If that happened, it would be painful, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world.  
    
    当然，我也有可能出丑。如果那样的话，我会很痛苦，但不会是世界末日。  
    
    This one night doesn’t define who I am, and I’ll have other opportunities to make friends.  
    
    这一夜并不能决定我是谁，我还会有其他机会结交朋友。  
    
    Regardless, it’s not helpful to keep worrying about making a fool of myself – doing so will just keep me stuck in my head and make it harder to make friends tonight.  
    
    不管怎么说，老是担心自己出丑是没有用的，这样做只会让我闷在心里，让我今晚更难交到朋友。_  
    
    提示：现实一点。自欺欺人是导致失败的最快方法。我可能会说一些令人尴尬的话，那会非常尴尬。但即使我说了几句尴尬的话，我也可能会说一些有趣或好玩的话。

**Level up your conversational skills  

提高你的对话技巧**

If you’re avoiding social interactions, your conversational skills might be a little rusty.  

如果你回避社交互动，那么你的谈话技巧可能有点生疏。

Levelling up your social skills is just as important as any other tactic for addressing your social anxiety because here’s the hard truth: social anxiety can actually increase the very thing you fear – rejection.  

提高你的社交技巧和其他解决社交焦虑的策略一样重要，因为这里有一个硬道理：社交焦虑实际上会增加你所害怕的东西--拒绝。

Imagine you’re on a date, and you’re worrying about the dreaded awkward silence. Before the date, you generate a list of conversation topics and rehearse some answers.  

想象一下，你正在约会，你正在担心可怕的尴尬沉默。在约会前，你列出了一系列谈话话题，并排练了一些回答。  

When you get to the date, you’re trembling with fear about the conversation dying. You pepper your date with questions.  

约会时，你战战兢兢，生怕谈话就此结束。你向约会对象提出各种问题。  

They are speaking and then pause, and you jump in to squash the silence – and you accidentally interrupt them. You do this a few times. The conversation has a staccato flow.  

他们正说着话，然后停顿了一下，你跳出来打破沉默--你不小心打断了他们。你这样做了好几次。谈话就这样 "噔噔噔 "地进行着。

Your date might misinterpret your behaviour and think that you want to dominate the conversation or feel like you don’t care what they have to say.  

你的约会对象可能会误解你的行为，认为你想主导谈话，或者觉得你不在乎他们想说什么。  

Of course, these interpretations are not true, but your social anxiety is telling them otherwise.  

当然，这些解释都不是真的，只是你的社交焦虑告诉他们不是这样的。

Here’s how to improve three social skills that will help build your social confidence:  

下面介绍如何提高三种社交技巧，帮助你建立社交自信：

_**Starting conversations 开始对话**_

Initiating a conversation shows someone you’re interested in them and what they have to say. But you might be worried that you don’t know what to say or how to say it.  

主动与人交谈，表明你对他和他想说的话感兴趣。但你可能会担心不知道该说什么或怎么说。  

You can take the pressure off: there is no secret codeword to start a conversation.  

您可以减轻压力：没有什么秘密暗语可以开始对话。

Instead of perseverating on _how_ to start a conversation, focus on _why_ you are starting it. What are you hoping to gain from the conversation? From there, decide on your opening volley. It’s often easiest to keep it simple.  

与其锲而不舍地考虑如何开始对话，不如集中精力考虑为什么要开始对话。你希望从谈话中获得什么？由此决定你的开场白。通常最简单的方法就是保持简单。  

Aim for areas of common ground, such as a recent cultural event, a shared experience, or, yes, the weather.  

寻找共同点，比如最近的文化活动、共同经历，或者天气。

_**Reading the room 阅读室**_

Knowing how to read the room will help you navigate all types of social situations, including knowing when and how to jump into a conversation.  

懂得如何察言观色将有助于你在各种社交场合中游刃有余，包括知道何时以及如何进入谈话。

For example, in Western cultures, eye contact generally conveys interest.  

例如，在西方文化中，眼神交流通常表示兴趣。  

Is someone gazing at you to show interest in what you’re saying, or are their eyes drifting to the surrounding environment (perhaps indicating boredom) or their watch (indicating they might want to wrap it up)?  

有人注视着你是为了表示对你所说的内容感兴趣，还是他们的视线飘向了周围的环境（可能表示无聊）或手表（表示他们可能想结束谈话）？  

Similarly, an open body posture, warm smile or nodding head might indicate that they are interested in you or your conversation, whereas a closed-off stance or frown might indicate a lack of interest.  

同样，开放的身体姿态、热情的微笑或点头可能表示他们对你或你的谈话感兴趣，而封闭的姿态或皱眉可能表示缺乏兴趣。

An important caveat here: people’s moods and interest are not always decipherable, and you don’t want to hyper-analyse a person’s every muscle movement.  

这里有一个重要的注意事项：人们的情绪和兴趣并不总是可以解读的，你不希望过度分析一个人的每一个肌肉动作。  

Rather, use a person’s body language as a general guide for determining whether you should initiate and continue a conversation or redirect your efforts elsewhere.  

相反，应将一个人的肢体语言作为总体指南，以确定您是应该发起并继续对话，还是将精力转移到别处。

_**Asking good questions 提出好问题**_

Asking good questions is key to keeping the conversation going. Try the AAA method:  

提出好问题是保持对话的关键。试试 AAA 法：

-   _Attend_: aim to be an ‘active listener’ – what are the main topics the person is mentioning? Are there certain topics that they seem excited about or want input on?  
    
    倾听：目标是成为一名 "积极的倾听者"--对方提到的主要话题是什么？他们是否对某些话题感到兴奋或希望提供意见？
-   _Answer_: when they stop speaking, show them you were listening by responding to something they said.  
    
    回答：当他们停止说话时，回应他们说的话，表示你在听。  
    
    It is usually better to respond to a main point instead of a tangential detail, but don’t worry about picking the ‘correct’ thing to respond to (this doesn’t exist).  
    
    通常情况下，回应一个要点比回应一个无关紧要的细节要好，但不要担心选择 "正确 "的回应（这是不存在的）。  
    
    Pick whatever feels easiest or most natural to you.  
    
    选择你觉得最容易或最自然的方式。
-   _Ask_: follow up with a question to show that you want to learn more about them.  
    
    问：跟进一个问题，表明你想更多地了解他们。  
    
    The question could be a simple follow-up (‘What was your favourite part of your trip?’) or something more personal (‘How did you feel when they said that to you?’).  
    
    问题可以是一个简单的后续问题（"您在旅行中最喜欢的部分是什么？  
    
    The AAA method is one tool to ask good questions, but it is not meant to be formulaic. It doesn’t matter if you lose track of the conversation (some people like to ramble!).  
    
    AAA 法是提出好问题的一种工具，但它并不意味着公式化。如果你失去了谈话的方向（有些人喜欢滔滔不绝！），也没有关系。  
    
    If you are caught up on remembering every word a person said, you’ll probably sound distracted or inauthentic when it’s your time to speak.  
    
    如果你只顾着记住别人说的每一个字，那么当你发言的时候，你可能会听起来心不在焉或不真实。  
    
    The most rewarding conversations are usually those that flow naturally. The idea here is to do your best to listen and respond to the main gist of what someone is saying.  
    
    最有收获的对话通常是那些自然流畅的对话。这里的意思是尽你所能倾听并回应别人所说的主要内容。

**Exposure: do the things that scare you  

接触：做让你害怕的事**

Exposure involves intentionally and repeatedly engaging in the social situations that you fear.  

暴露是指有意地、反复地接触你所恐惧的社交场合。  

Think about exposures as behavioural experiments to test out whether your dreaded Worst Case Scenario will come true. _Spoiler alert_: exposures work by showing you that your Worst Case Scenario probably won’t happen and that the situations you dread are probably not as bad as you thought.  

把 "暴露 "看作是一种行为实验，用来测试你害怕的 "最坏情况 "是否会成真。剧透：暴露的作用是让你知道你最坏的情况可能不会发生，你害怕的情况可能没有你想象的那么糟糕。

One frustrating part about social anxiety is that it’s rarely cured with a one-and-done exposure. Instead, you have to keep practising.  

社交焦虑令人沮丧的地方在于，它很少能通过一次又一次的暴露而治愈。相反，你必须不断练习。  

The more exposures you do, the better you will feel.  

曝光次数越多，感觉就越好。

To get started, list all the social situations that make you anxious, such as:  

开始时，请列出所有让你焦虑的社交场合，例如

-   messaging someone on a dating app;  
    
    在交友软件上给某人发信息
-   introducing myself to a stranger;  
    
    向陌生人介绍自己
-   attending a work happy hour by myself;  
    
    一个人参加工作欢乐时光
-   raising my hand in class; or  
    
    在课堂上举手发言；或
-   giving a co-worker critical feedback.  
    
    向同事提出批评意见。

Don’t filter; write down as many situations as come to mind.  

不要筛选，想到多少就写多少。

Next, rate each situation from 0 (_no anxiety_) to 100 (_maximum anxiety_), and then rank-order each from least to most anxiety-provoking.  

然后，对每种情况从 0（不焦虑）到 100（最焦虑）打分，再从最不焦虑到最焦虑排序。  

When it comes to choosing your first attempt at exposure, start with one of the situations that is lower on your anxiety thermometer; later, work your way up the list gradually.  

在选择第一次尝试暴露的情境时，先从焦虑温度计上较低的情境开始；之后再逐步往上尝试。

For each exposure, follow the step-by-step process below.  

对于每次曝光，请按照以下步骤进行。

Before your exposure: 曝光前

-   _Identify your biggest fear(s)._ What are you most afraid will happen in this specific situation? This could be something like being told you are stupid or getting laughed at.  
    
    找出你最大的恐惧。在这种特定情况下，你最害怕发生什么？可能是别人说你笨，也可能是别人嘲笑你。
-   _Make a plan._ Where will you do the exposure? With whom? Sort out some details ahead of time, and then schedule a time to do the exposure.  
    
    制定计划。在哪里曝光？与谁？提前理清一些细节，然后安排时间进行曝光。  
    
    Planning makes it more likely that you’ll follow through.  
    
    有计划才更有可能坚持到底。
-   _Set an achievable goal._ Identify one thing you want to accomplish during the exposure. Pick an objective behaviour, such as ‘ask two questions’ or ‘invite them to coffee’. Avoid goals based on feelings (eg, ‘don’t get anxious’) because they are difficult to measure and don’t tell you whether an exposure was successful. You can feel very anxious and have a successful interaction!  
    
    设定一个可实现的目标。确定您希望在接触过程中完成的一件事。选择一个客观的行为，如 "问两个问题 "或 "请他们喝咖啡"。避免基于感觉的目标（如 "不要焦虑"），因为这些目标很难衡量，也无法告诉您暴露是否成功。你可以感到非常焦虑，但也可以有一次成功的互动！  
    
    You also want to avoid goals about other people’s perceptions (eg, ‘appear smart’) because you’re not a mind reader and never _really_ know what others think.  
    
    你也要避免把别人的看法作为目标（如 "显得聪明"），因为你不是读心者，永远无法真正了解别人的想法。

During your exposure: 曝光期间

-   _Monitor and eliminate what psychologists call ‘safety behaviours’._ [Safety behaviours](https://psyche.co/ideas/how-to-tell-whether-youre-being-careful-or-giving-in-to-anxiety) are subtle things you do to feel more comfortable and avoid facing your fears head-on, such as checking your phone to avoid having a conversation, tightly gripping a drink to occupy trembling hands, or averting eye contact to avoid getting asked a question.  
    
    监控并消除心理学家所说的 "安全行为"。安全行为是你为了感觉更舒适、避免直面恐惧而做的一些微妙的事情，比如查看手机以避免交谈，紧握饮料以控制颤抖的双手，或转移视线以避免被问到问题。  
    
    Sometimes, people use substances such as alcohol or cannabis to feel more comfortable in social situations.  
    
    有时，人们会使用酒精或大麻等物质，以便在社交场合感觉更自在。  
    
    For example, the phrase ‘liquid courage’ refers to the increased social confidence people feel when they drink alcohol.  
    
    例如，"液体勇气 "一词指的是人们在饮酒时会增强社交自信。  
    
    Using substances to feel less anxious can facilitate a problematic pattern where a person increasingly feels like they _need_ substances to participate or enjoy a social situation. For exposures to work, you must _fully_ encounter the situation – which means dropping your safety behaviours. If not, you teach yourself that you can get through the situation only if you avoid certain aspects of it.  
    
    使用药物来减轻焦虑会助长一种有问题的模式，即一个人越来越觉得他们需要药物来参与或享受社交场合。要使暴露有效，你必须完全面对这种情况--这意味着放弃你的安全行为。否则，你就会让自己明白，只有避免某些方面的情况，你才能度过难关。

After your exposure: 曝光之后

-   _Debrief._ Answer two questions. First, did your biggest fear come true? Majority of the time, it won’t (or you simply don’t have enough evidence to determine if it did!).  
    
    汇报。回答两个问题。第一，你最大的恐惧成真了吗？大多数情况下，它不会成真（或者你根本没有足够的证据来确定它是否成真！）。  
    
    Second, what did you learn from the situation? Jot down a few insights.  
    
    第二，你从中学到了什么？记下几点启示。  
    
    You might find, for example, that you felt less anxious than you anticipated or that you enjoyed some moment(s) of the interaction.  
    
    例如，你可能会发现自己的焦虑感比预期的要少，或者你很享受互动的某些时刻。  
    
    Over time, as you repeat these exposures, you will ‘unlearn’ the terrifying aspects of socialising and ‘relearn’ new ones – including how wonderful social interactions can be.  
    
    随着时间的推移，当你重复这些接触时，你会 "解除 "社交中可怕的一面，并 "重新学习 "新的一面--包括社交是多么美妙。
-   _Reward yourself._ You were brave enough to face your fears, and you’re probably a bit exhausted from it. You’ve earned a treat.  
    
    奖励自己。你有足够的勇气面对恐惧，你可能已经为此筋疲力尽了。你赢得了犒赏。  
    
    Pick a reward that’s reinforcing as an extra dose of motivation for your next exposure.  
    
    选择一种具有强化作用的奖励，作为下一次接触的额外动力。
-   _Plan for the next exposure._ Keep up the momentum by planning for the next exposure. Avoidance is anxiety’s best friend – the longer the gap between exposures, the harder it will be to get going again.  
    
    计划下一次曝光。为下一次暴露做好计划，以保持动力。逃避是焦虑最好的朋友--暴露的间隔时间越长，就越难重新开始。  
    
    Make exposure a habit. And if you’re really struggling to get going with these exposure exercises, jump to the Learn More section below for some additional tips.

In sum, you can successfully tackle your social anxiety with three strategies: brushing up your conversational skills, catching and correcting your unhelpful thinking habits, and intentionally participating in scary social situations.  

总之，你可以通过三种策略成功地解决社交焦虑：提高你的对话技巧，抓住并纠正你的不良思维习惯，以及有意识地参与可怕的社交场合。  

As you work through your social anxiety, be sure to remind yourself why you’re doing this – and what your life might look like on the other side of your efforts.  

在你克服社交焦虑的过程中，一定要提醒自己为什么要这样做--以及努力的另一面你的生活会是什么样子。

### Key points – How to overcome social anxiety  

要点--如何克服社交焦虑

1.  **Understand the causes of social anxiety.** At its core, social anxiety concerns a fear of rejection. When you feel socially anxious, you worry about what others think of you and hope you are making a good impression.  
    
    了解社交焦虑的原因。社交焦虑的核心是害怕被拒绝。当你感到社交焦虑时，你会担心别人对你的看法，希望自己给别人留下好印象。
2.  **Identify your goals.** Identify areas of your social life that you want to improve, such as making more friends or speaking up in meetings – these goals will guide you as you work through your social anxiety.  
    
    确定目标。确定你在社交生活中想要改善的方面，如结交更多朋友或在会议上大胆发言--这些目标将指导你克服社交焦虑。
3.  **Break unhelpful thinking habits.** Your negative thoughts about social situations drive your anxiety. Question the evidence for these thoughts and generate a more balanced perspective.  
    
    打破无益的思维习惯。你对社交场合的消极想法会驱使你产生焦虑。对这些想法的证据提出质疑，并形成更平衡的观点。
4.  **Level up your conversational skills.** Three social skills can improve your social confidence: starting conversations, reading the room, and asking good questions.  
    
    提高对话技巧。有三种社交技巧可以提高你的社交自信：开始对话、阅读房间和提出好问题。
5.  **Exposure: do the things that scare you.** Gradually and systematically participate in different social situations so you can practise socialising, learn that your Worst Case Scenario probably won’t happen, and enjoy the beauty of social relationships.  
    
    接触：做让你害怕的事情。逐步、有计划地参与不同的社交场合，这样你就可以练习社交，了解最坏的情况可能不会发生，并享受社交关系的美好。

**Overcoming exposure roadblocks  

克服曝光障碍**

Intentionally putting yourself in anxiety-provoking social situations (practising ‘exposures’) is key to overcoming social anxiety but, as I said before, it can often be challenging (and scary!) to get going.  

有意识地让自己置身于令人焦虑的社交场合（练习 "暴露"）是克服社交焦虑的关键，但正如我之前所说，要开始这样做往往会很有挑战性（而且很可怕！）。  

Let me help you get ahead of some of the common roadblocks that people encounter when doing exposures so you’ll be prepared when they arise.  

让我来帮你解决人们在进行曝光时遇到的一些常见障碍，以便在出现这些障碍时做好准备。

-   Roadblock 1: you don’t know how to do the exposure.  
    
    路障 1：你不知道如何进行曝光。

Try an _imaginal exposure_, where you vividly imagine the feared situation. Walk through exactly how the situation could go and what you could say and do.  

尝试想象暴露，即生动地想象害怕的情况。想象一下当时的情景，你会说什么，会做什么。  

Go through a few iterations so you’re prepared for whatever comes up.  

经过几次反复，这样你就能做好准备，应对任何可能出现的情况。  

This helps you practise facing your fears in a safer environment and generate ideas for when you do the exposure in real life.  

这可以帮助你在更安全的环境中练习面对恐惧，并为你在现实生活中进行暴露时产生想法。

-   Roadblock 2: you feel too anxious to start the exposure.  
    
    拦路虎 2：您对开始接触感到过于焦虑。

Anxiety is accompanied by a host of physical sensations such as a racing heart, trembling, muscle tension and sweating.  

焦虑会伴随一系列身体感觉，如心跳加速、颤抖、肌肉紧张和出汗。  

Relaxation techniques can reduce the discomfort and intensity of these physical symptoms before you enter a social interaction. Here are three relaxation techniques:  

放松技巧可以在您参加社交活动之前减轻这些生理症状的不适感和强度。以下是三种放松技巧：

_Paced breathing_. Anxiety causes fast, shallow breathing. Paced breathing is a surprisingly effective and quick way to reduce anxiety.  

呼吸急促。焦虑会导致呼吸过快、过浅。有节奏的呼吸是一种令人惊讶的有效而快速的缓解焦虑的方法。  

Slowly inhale through your nose for five seconds, then slowly exhale through your mouth for five seconds. Try six to eight cycles of paced breathing.  

用鼻子慢慢吸气 5 秒钟，然后用嘴慢慢呼气 5 秒钟。尝试六到八个周期的有节奏呼吸。  

When you breathe in, fill up your stomach with air (not your chest) so it expands like a balloon. When you breathe out, imagine slowly deflating the balloon.  

吸气时，将空气注入腹部（而不是胸部），这样腹部就会像气球一样膨胀。呼气时，想象气球慢慢地瘪下去。

_Progressive muscle relaxation_. This technique involves slowly alternating between tensing and relaxing specific muscles. Make a fist by squeezing your hand tightly. Notice the tension in your hand.  

渐进式肌肉放松。这种技巧包括缓慢地交替绷紧和放松特定的肌肉。握紧拳头。注意手部的紧张感。  

After five seconds, slowly open your fist and notice the tension leaving your hand. Repeat this process with different muscles.  

五秒钟后，慢慢打开拳头，注意手部的紧张感。用不同的肌肉重复这一过程。

_Engage your senses._ The ‘54321’ technique engages your five senses to shift your focus away from negative thoughts and to the present moment. Name 5 things you _see_, 4 things you _feel_, 3 things you _hear_, 2 things you _smell_, and 1 thing you _taste_. You can also try extreme changes in your senses, such as changing your body temperature drastically by dipping your face in ice-cold water.  

调动你的感官54321 "技巧可以调动你的五种感官，将你的注意力从负面想法转移到当下。说出你看到的 5 件事、感觉到的 4 件事、听到的 3 件事、闻到的 2 件事和尝到的 1 件事。你还可以尝试极端的感官变化，比如将脸浸入冰水中，从而大幅改变体温。  

This can slow your heart rate and calm you down.  

这可以减缓心率，让你平静下来。

-   Roadblock 3: you completed some exposures, but you don’t feel less anxious.  
    
    路障 3：你完成了一些曝光，但并没有减少焦虑感。

Remember: it takes repetition and consistency for exposures to work. Change is not linear; your anxiety, motivation and exposure progress will all fluctuate.  

记住：暴露需要重复和坚持才能奏效。变化不是线性的；你的焦虑、动机和暴露进展都会波动。  

Unsteady progress does not mean you are not improving. Setbacks are an inevitable part of the road to getting better.  

进展不稳定并不意味着你没有进步。挫折是进步道路上不可避免的一部分。

When you lose motivation, remind yourself why you are doing this work. Anchor yourself to your values. What is important to you? What gives you a sense of purpose and meaning?  

当你失去动力时，提醒自己为什么要做这项工作。用你的价值观来支撑自己。什么对你很重要？是什么给了你目标感和意义感？  

What do you want your life to look like?  

你希望自己的生活是什么样的？

When you feel discouraged, practise realistic self-compassion. Treat yourself fairly and embrace yourself with kindness – just like you would a loved one.  

当你感到灰心丧气时，请进行现实的自我同情。公平地对待自己，善意地拥抱自己--就像对待亲人一样。

-   Roadblock 4: you need support  
    
    路障 4：你需要支持

Working on your mental health can feel isolating, and exposure is hard work. Asking for help is a sign of courage, not weakness. Try recruiting help from a friend or family member.  

为心理健康而努力可能会让人感觉孤立无援，暴露自己也是一项艰苦的工作。寻求帮助是勇气的象征，而不是软弱。试着寻求朋友或家人的帮助。  

They can help you plan an exposure, model one for you, or even do an exposure with you.  

他们可以帮你计划曝光，为你做模特，甚至和你一起曝光。

It might also be helpful to work with a mental health professional who can be a consistent source of support and guide you through the exposure process.  

与心理健康专业人士合作也可能会有帮助，他们可以为你提供持续的支持，并指导你完成暴露过程。  

You could also consider trying group therapy, where you work together on exposures and other social anxiety tools with a small group of people who also struggle with anxiety.  

您还可以考虑尝试团体治疗，与一小群同样有焦虑症的人一起练习暴露和其他社交焦虑工具。  

If you feel like you could benefit from medication, which can also be helpful for anxiety, consider a consultation with a psychiatrist or your primary care physician.  

如果您觉得药物治疗对焦虑症也有帮助，可以考虑咨询精神科医生或主治医生。

Humans would not be here but for pregnancy and childbirth. It is true for each of us and, more importantly, true for all of us, collectively.  

如果不是因为怀孕和分娩，人类就不会在这里了。这对我们每个人来说都是真实的，更重要的是，对我们所有人来说都是真实的，集体的。  

These uncomfortable, protracted and wonderful challenges not only shepherd us into the world, but also shape our behaviour, social structure and the trajectory of our evolution itself.  

这些不舒服的、旷日持久的、奇妙的挑战不仅将我们牧养到这个世界，而且还塑造了我们的行为、社会结构和我们进化本身的轨迹。  

The surprising part is that, while pregnancy and childbirth are fundamental and defining traits of mammals, they have driven us humans to be very un-mammalian indeed.  

令人惊讶的是，虽然怀孕和分娩是哺乳动物的基本和决定性特征，但它们促使我们人类确实变得非常不像哺乳动物。

Popular notion often has it that natural selection works by seizing on fundamental traits and processes, and optimising them with each new beat of the generations and species.  

流行的观念常常认为，自然选择是通过抓住基本的特征和过程，并在每一代和每一个物种的新节拍中对其进行优化。  

But that’s not always true.  

但这并不总是真的。  

Instead of functioning as a refining, perfecting tool, evolution in the real world is all about trade-offs: life has limitations, and big changes in one area often mean sacrifices in others.  

现实世界中的进化不是作为一种精炼、完善的工具，而是关于权衡：生活有局限性，一个领域的巨大变化往往意味着其他领域的牺牲。  

We humans are the smartest, most complex animals on the planet, but we do not have the best or most optimised biology by any stretch, especially not when it comes to reproduction.  

我们人类是地球上最聪明、最复杂的动物，但无论如何我们都没有最好或最优化的生物学，尤其是在繁殖方面。

Witnessing our fellow mammals give birth, experiencing the rawness of sight, smell and sound, lays bare the biology before us.  

目睹我们的哺乳动物伙伴分娩，体验视觉、嗅觉和听觉的原始性，使我们面前的生物学变得赤裸裸。  

On the one hand is the disgust born of our evolutionary predilection to avoid blood and fluids of other animals – a necessary impulse in pre-sanitary times.  

一方面是我们在进化过程中倾向于避免其他动物的血液和液体而产生的厌恶感--这是前卫生时代的必要冲动。  

No matter one’s willingness to embrace a positive view of bodily function, the stomach requires training against the mind when any human, for example a doctor, engages this evolutionary apparatus.  

无论人们是否愿意接受对身体功能的积极看法，当任何人类，例如医生，接触到这个进化的机器时，胃部都需要针对心灵的训练。  

The shame and avoidance we feel with all forms of bodily discharge are a sound and healthy part of our subconscious.  

我们对各种形式的身体排放感到羞耻和回避，是我们潜意识中健全和健康的一部分。

There is, however, a deeper discomfort that arises from watching our fellow mammals give birth – one notices a nonchalance compared with our own elaborate, painful and sacramental experience.  

然而，在观看我们的哺乳动物同伴分娩时，有一种更深层次的不适感--与我们自己精心设计的、痛苦的和神圣的经历相比，人们注意到一种无所谓的态度。  

A cow moos and lows in mild discomfort, as one might when feeling full after a good meal, but it does not compare with the suffering of a birthing human mother.  

一头牛在轻微的不适中呻吟，就像人们在饱餐一顿后感到饱腹一样，但这并不能与人类母亲分娩时的痛苦相比。  

The calf is birthed quickly, practically dropping to the ground after a short push – nothing compared with our day or more of arduous labour.  

小牛很快就生出来了，在短暂的用力后几乎掉到了地上--与我们一天或更长时间的艰苦劳动相比，这不算什么。  

For our survival, and the core of our family happiness, our species must endure pain and risk. We are _alone_ in this, and it troubles us.  

为了我们的生存，以及我们家庭幸福的核心，我们的物种必须忍受痛苦和风险。在这一点上我们是孤独的，这让我们感到烦恼。

We are alone because, though we are a mammal like the cow, and like our nearest cousins the chimps and other apes, we do not act like a mammal, hardly ever.  

我们是孤独的，因为尽管我们是像牛一样的哺乳动物，也像我们最近的表亲黑猩猩和其他猿类一样，我们的行为不像哺乳动物，几乎没有。  

Our blood is warm, our skin has hair, our brain is well-integrated across its hemispheres – and there the similarities end.  

我们的血液是温暖的，我们的皮肤有毛发，我们的大脑在各半球之间很好地结合在一起--相似之处也就到此为止。  

For a mammal, we live too long, we are too smart for our size, and we are too faithful to our partners. In these particulars, we are decidedly not alone – but, rather, alone in our class.  

对于哺乳动物来说，我们的寿命太长，我们的体型太聪明，我们对我们的伙伴太忠诚。在这些方面，我们绝对不是孤独的--而是在我们的等级中孤独。

The other post-reptilian, warm-blooded, big-brained class of animals – only distantly related to us – share far more of what makes us human than do our hairy near-cousins.  

另一类后爬行动物、温血动物、大脑袋动物--与我们只有远亲关系--与我们的毛茸茸的近亲相比，分享了更多使我们成为人类的因素。  

To understand humans – and our reproduction – we have to start with birds.  

要了解人类--以及我们的繁殖--我们必须从鸟类开始。

More specifically, we begin with the kiwi.  

具体而言，我们从猕猴桃开始。  

This unusual New Zealand bird is one of the handful of surviving ratites – the group of large, flightless birds that include the ostrich, emu, cassowary and rhea.  

这种不寻常的新西兰鸟类是少数幸存的鼠类之一--这类大型、不会飞的鸟类包括鸵鸟、鸸鹋、袋鼠和鼠妇。  

There is much to be interested in about kiwis, but the most consequential of their many oddities is their extreme approach to eggs. Kiwis lay the largest egg, relative to their body size, of any bird.  

关于猕猴桃有很多值得关注的地方，但在它们众多的怪癖中，最重要的是它们对蛋的极端态度。相对于它们的身体大小，猕猴桃是所有鸟类中产蛋最多的。  

They usually produce only one such egg per season, and it typically weighs about a quarter of the weight of the mother.  

它们通常每季只产一个这样的蛋，而且通常重约为母体重量的四分之一。  

To frame a more easily grasped comparison: kiwis are similar in size to a domestic chicken, but lay an egg six times larger. Corresponding to this enormous egg is an equally enormous incubation period.  

用一个更容易掌握的对比来说明：猕猴桃的大小与家鸡相似，但产下的蛋却比家鸡大六倍。与这个巨大的蛋相对应的是一个同样巨大的孵化期。

Whereas a chicken will sit on its egg for 21 days to hatch a chick, and a duck typically 28-35 days, depending on the species, the kiwi sits a record-setting average of about 85 days to hatch its single, massive egg.  

鸡要在蛋上坐21天才能孵出小鸡，鸭子一般要坐28-35天，这取决于物种，而猕猴桃要坐85天左右才能孵出它那颗巨大的蛋，创下了历史记录。

The kiwi is engaging in an evolutionary compromise with egg-laying itself. To humans, with our long pregnancies and painful childbirth, eggs might seem enviable.  

猕猴桃正在与产蛋本身进行进化上的妥协。对人类来说，由于我们怀孕时间长，分娩痛苦，卵子似乎令人羡慕。  

Instead of an exhausting pregnancy, a massive egg would mean no swollen feet, no acid reflux and, importantly, a ‘pregnancy’ that could be shared; anyone can keep an egg warm for a few hours if the mother needs a break.  

一个巨大的鸡蛋将意味着没有肿胀的脚，没有胃酸倒流，重要的是，一个可以分享的 "怀孕"；如果母亲需要休息，任何人都可以将鸡蛋保温几个小时。

By laying enormous eggs, and incubating them so long, the kiwi gives its babies the maximum development time  

通过产下巨大的蛋，并孵化这么长时间，猕猴桃给它的孩子提供了最大的发育时间。

But it is important to remember why mammalian pregnancy was such a successful adaptation in the first place, and the kiwi points at the reasons.  

但重要的是要记住，为什么哺乳动物的怀孕首先是一种成功的适应，而猕猴桃指出了其中的原因。  

When a mammal (other than a human) is pregnant, time is on her side. Take the [elephant](https://aeon.co/essays/if-elephants-arent-persons-yet-could-they-be-one-day), with the longest pregnancy of any mammal: about two years.  

当哺乳动物（除人类外）怀孕时，时间是站在她这边的。以大象为例，它是所有哺乳动物中怀孕时间最长的：大约两年。  

The elephant calf, though huge by human standards, is smaller compared with the mother than our human infants – and even more importantly, is much smaller compared with the mother’s hips.  

小象虽然以人类的标准来看是巨大的，但与母亲相比，它比我们人类的婴儿要小--更重要的是，与母亲的臀部相比要小得多。  

This long pregnancy might sound a bit of a drag, but for the elephant, who has a relatively easy birth to look forward to, and a relatively smaller baby causing her minimal discomfort, it is a huge advantage over an egg.  

这种漫长的妊娠期听起来可能有点拖沓，但对于大象来说，她可以期待一个相对容易的分娩，而且一个相对较小的婴儿给她带来的不适最小，这比鸡蛋有很大的优势。  

First, she remains entirely mobile, not bound to a nest and to a physically separate offspring that could tempt a predator or that might need to be abandoned if danger strikes.  

首先，她保持完全的流动性，而不是被束缚在一个巢穴和一个物理上独立的后代身上，因为这可能会引诱捕食者，或者在危险来临时可能需要被抛弃。  

Moreover, she can take her time growing her baby to a much more mature and capable age before it is birthed and must be looked after.  

此外，她可以慢慢地把孩子培养到更成熟、更有能力的年龄，然后再把孩子生下来，必须照顾好。  

All she needs to do to look after her baby while pregnant is to look after herself, eat well, and stay safe. She can keep ‘feeding’ the baby (via the placenta) simply by feeding herself.  

她在怀孕期间需要做的就是照顾好自己，吃好，并保持安全。她可以通过喂养自己来继续 "喂养 "婴儿（通过胎盘）。

The kiwi has a very different problem. Laying an egg means giving your baby all the nutrients it will need to develop from fertilised embryo to hatched baby, all at once.  

猕猴桃有一个非常不同的问题。产卵意味着给宝宝提供从受精胚胎到孵化宝宝所需的所有营养物质，而且是一次性的。  

At the moment the egg is laid, it has all the nutrients it will ever have – a very different proposition from the constant feeding the elephant baby gets in the womb.  

在产蛋的那一刻，它拥有它将拥有的所有营养--这与象宝宝在子宫里得到的持续喂养是完全不同的命题。  

That means that eggs place a fundamental limit on how long a baby can grow before it hatches, which mammals (other than the egg-laying monotremes) do not face.  

这意味着鸡蛋对婴儿在孵化前能生长多久有一个基本限制，而哺乳动物（除产蛋的单体动物外）并不面临这种限制。  

The kiwi is living right at the edge of that limit.  

猕猴桃就生活在这个极限的边缘。  

By laying such enormous eggs, and incubating them so long, the kiwi is giving its babies the maximum amount of development time it can before the babies hatch out and have to face the world.  

通过产下如此巨大的蛋，并孵化如此之久，猕猴桃在婴儿孵化出来并不得不面对世界之前，给了它的婴儿最大的发育时间。  

Achieving that maximum is not without its costs. Laying eggs is fairly draining for any bird, and the kiwi more than most.  

实现这一最大值并非没有代价。产蛋对任何鸟类来说都是相当耗费精力的，而猕猴桃比大多数鸟类更耗费精力。  

She must eat as much as three times her normal intake for the full month in which the egg develops, and is left significantly weakened by the experience.  

在卵子发育的整整一个月里，她必须吃多达她正常摄入量三倍的东西，并因这一经历而明显变弱。  

Moreover, the size of the kiwi egg is about as large as a bird of her size can safely grow and lay – it takes up a great deal of the space in her body by the time it is ready to be laid.  

此外，猕猴桃蛋的大小与她这种体型的鸟儿能够安全成长和产蛋的大小差不多--在准备产蛋的时候，它占据了她身体的大量空间。  

And, for all this compromise, the kiwi ekes out a three-month gestation. The elephant, with little compromise at all, sails on happily for another 19 months.  

而且，由于所有这些妥协，猕猴桃的妊娠期只有三个月。大象几乎没有任何妥协，快乐地继续航行了19个月。

Either way, both egg-tending and pregnancy are easier for the mother kiwi and the elephant than for us.  

无论如何，对于猕猴桃母亲和大象来说，照料卵子和怀孕都比我们容易。  

The evolutionary incentive is to gestate as long as possible, so that childrearing will be less onerous.  

进化的动力是尽可能地延长妊娠期，这样养育孩子的负担就会减轻。  

The elephant pulls this off entirely, with a baby that is born, wobbles to its legs, and can, within the day, walk behind its mother, nurse when it needs to, and feed itself with supplementary food.  

大象完全可以做到这一点，婴儿出生后，摇摇晃晃地走到腿上，并能在一天之内走到母亲身后，在需要的时候哺乳，并以补充食物喂养自己。  

The kiwi manages to achieve much the same result; the babies can walk, feed themselves, and follow their mother within a few hours of birth.  

猕猴桃设法取得了大致相同的结果；婴儿在出生后几小时内就能走路、自己进食并跟随母亲。

But while elephants represent the typical mammal experience, kiwis are a very unusual bird.  

但是，虽然大象代表了典型的哺乳动物体验，但猕猴桃是一种非常不寻常的鸟类。  

The overwhelming majority of other birds are born extremely underdeveloped: little, blind, pink, nearly featherless infants that can barely move on their own for the first several weeks of life, and are confined to the nest for months, assiduously cared for by their harried parents.  

绝大多数其他鸟类出生时发育极不完善：小的、盲的、粉红色的、几乎没有羽毛的婴儿，在出生后的头几周几乎不能独立行动，而且被限制在巢中数月，由其辛苦的父母辛勤照料。  

This is true even of birds with similarly large eggs and similarly long incubation periods as the kiwi, like albatrosses (where the young hatch with a good coat of soft feathers) and are a bit more capable than, say, a songbird like a wren or crow.  

即使是和奇异鸟有类似的大蛋和类似的长孵化期的鸟类也是如此，比如信天翁（幼鸟在孵化时有一层很好的柔软的羽毛），比起像鹪鹩或乌鸦这样的鸣禽来说，能力更强一些。

For most birds, eggs force a difficult compromise on the mother: the size of a bird’s body limits the size of its eggs; the size of the eggs limits how much nutrition they can contain; the nutrition in the egg limits the length of incubation; and the length of incubation limits the maturity of the offspring at hatching.  

对于大多数鸟类来说，鸟蛋迫使母亲做出艰难的妥协：鸟类身体的大小限制了鸟蛋的大小；鸟蛋的大小限制了鸟蛋所能容纳的营养；鸟蛋中的营养限制了孵化的时间；孵化的时间限制了孵化时后代的成熟度。  

This means that most birds are trapped with a long, arduous period of childrearing after hatching, because their young do not have time in the egg to become mature enough to look after themselves.  

这意味着大多数鸟类在孵化后会被困于漫长而艰巨的育儿期，因为它们的幼鸟在蛋中没有时间变得足够成熟以照顾自己。

The birds that have more mature, or ‘nidifugous’, young are few and far between.  

有更多成熟的，或 "nidifugous "的幼鸟是很少的。  

They include ratites, ducks and other waterfowl, chickens and landfowl like pheasants, along with a few others scattered throughout the evolutionary tree.  

它们包括鼠类、鸭子和其他水禽、鸡和野鸡等陆生动物，以及散落在进化树上的其他一些动物。  

What all these more mature avian offspring have in common is that they are not the birds generally thought to be most intelligent, and none of them are songbirds: the great big crown group of modern birds that represent more than half of avian species today.  

所有这些比较成熟的鸟类后代的共同点是，它们不是一般认为最聪明的鸟类，而且它们都不是鸣禽：现代鸟类的大冠群，代表了今天一半以上的鸟类物种。  

None belong to the largest-brained, most intelligent avian groups like [parrots](https://aeon.co/ideas/pigs-parrots-and-people-the-problem-of-animal-personality), corvids and [pigeons](https://aeon.co/videos/heated-rivalries-and-pigeon-sex-the-passionate-world-of-scottish-doo-fleein), which are universally ‘altricial’ – giving rise to immature, demanding young. This makes sense – an animal that is going to have a highly developed, complex brain [needs](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2121467120) a longer time to construct that brain, and so needs a longer development time.  

它们都不属于大脑最大、最聪明的鸟类，如鹦鹉、鸟类和鸽子，它们普遍是 "无性繁殖"--生出不成熟、要求高的幼鸟。这是有道理的--一个将拥有高度发达、复杂的大脑的动物需要更长的时间来构建这个大脑，因此需要更长的发展时间。  

With the pre-hatching development limited by egg size, a lot of that brain development has to happen after hatching, which means raising young with a still developing brain.  

由于孵化前的发育受到鸡蛋大小的限制，大量的大脑发育必须在孵化后进行，这意味着要抚养大脑仍在发育的幼鸟。  

Small wonder it is hard work.  

难怪它是一项艰苦的工作。

Our big brain has to pass through a set of narrow hips. That means we have to be born young – very young  

我们的大脑袋必须通过一组狭窄的臀部。这意味着我们必须年轻出生--非常年轻

If this is all sounding a bit familiar, it’s because it feels human.  

如果这一切听起来有点熟悉，那是因为它感觉像人一样。  

A long childhood; demanding newborns; and parents needing to do nearly everything for the offspring for a protracted period of infant helplessness are what we as humans expect in our reproduction.  

漫长的童年；要求苛刻的新生儿；以及父母需要为后代做几乎所有的事情，以获得长期的婴儿无助感，这是我们人类在繁衍后代时的期望。  

Yet, given the advantages mammals gained in the evolution of pregnancy, why do we humans, too, not bear children much more like the elephant – a long, cruisy pregnancy and an easy, cooperative, capable child at the end of it?  

然而，鉴于哺乳动物在怀孕的进化过程中获得的优势，为什么我们人类也不像大象那样生孩子呢--漫长、残酷的怀孕，以及在怀孕结束后的轻松、合作、有能力的孩子？  

Evolution is always a game of compromises, and in pursuing our own key evolutionary advantage – our brain power – we have inadvertently given up the advantages of pregnancy and ended up back with the constraints of eggs.  

进化总是一个妥协的游戏，在追求我们自己的关键进化优势--我们的脑力--的过程中，我们无意中放弃了怀孕的优势，最终回到了卵子的限制。

Our brains are our most important adaptation.  

我们的大脑是我们最重要的适应。  

Human intelligence has no comparison in any other animal, and is the single trait that has allowed us to completely dominate this planet, shaping its ecology to our will.  

人类的智慧是任何其他动物都无法比拟的，这也是使我们能够完全主宰这个星球的唯一特征，按照我们的意愿塑造其生态。  

This intelligence works in tandem with another game-changing adaptation, our hands. We (and, indeed, other [primates](https://aeon.co/essays/how-clint-the-chimp-revised-theories-of-language-and-cognition)), have fantastically precise and manipulable hands. Our intelligence allows us to think up new tools and new processes to build, make and destroy, but our hands give us the dexterity to pull it off.  

这种智能与另一种改变游戏规则的适应性协同工作，即我们的手。我们（实际上还有其他灵长类动物）有一双非常精确和可操作的手。我们的智慧使我们能够想出新的工具和新的过程来建造、制造和破坏，但我们的手使我们能够灵巧地完成这些工作。  

Our reliance on our hands has driven two evolutionary changes in humans.  

我们对双手的依赖推动了人类的两种进化变化。  

First, it forms a virtuous cycle with our brains – agile hands need a lot of brain power to control them (as any robotics expert will lamentingly tell you).  

首先，它与我们的大脑形成了一个良性循环--敏捷的双手需要大量的脑力来控制它们（任何机器人专家都会感叹地告诉你）。  

Over time, the ability to be more precise and dextrous with our hands has driven the enlargement of our brains, in order to provide that computing power.  

随着时间的推移，用我们的手更精确、更灵巧的能力推动了我们大脑的扩大，以提供这种计算能力。  

Then, with bigger brains, and bigger ideas, we have used our hands in even more dextrous and complex ways – which in turn drives more brain power. The two [enrich](https://neurosciencenews.com/hand-dexterity-16696/) each other.  

然后，有了更大的大脑和更大的想法，我们以更加灵活和复杂的方式使用我们的双手--这反过来又推动了更多的大脑力量。两者相互促进。

The other hand-related adaptation is much less of a win-win.  

另一个与手有关的适应性就更不可能是双赢了。  

Since we rely so greatly on our hands for our evolutionary advantage, we have, over time, stopped using them to help with walking, balance and stability – that is, we evolved to walk upright.  

由于我们在进化过程中非常依赖我们的双手，随着时间的推移，我们已经不再使用它们来帮助行走、平衡和稳定--也就是说，我们进化成了直立行走。  

This keeps our hands free and ready for action, unlike even our close relatives, the chimps, and other great apes, who maintain our ancestral, hunched-over gait, and use their hands and arms to help walk, climb and balance.  

这使我们的双手保持自由并随时准备行动，甚至不像我们的近亲黑猩猩和其他类人猿，它们保持着我们祖先的驼背步态，用手和手臂帮助行走、攀爬和平衡。  

Our straight-as-a-ramrod stance has had two less positive outcomes. First: [backpain](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/press-centre/science-press-releases/27-04-2015). Second, and more importantly, it changed the angle and size of our hips.  

我们直来直去的姿态有两个不太积极的结果。第一：背痛。第二，更重要的是，它改变了我们臀部的角度和大小。  

Having our legs directly below our hips, rather than to the back and sides, and torso directly above, has required our pelvis to become narrower, and the opening in the middle to shrink as well.  

我们的腿在臀部的正下方，而不是在后面和两侧，躯干在正上方，这要求我们的骨盆变得更窄，中间的开口也缩小了。  

This narrowing is how we [end up](https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Abstract/2007/11000/The_Evolutionary_Origins_of_Obstructed_Labor_.23.aspx) with pregnancies more like eggs.  

这种缩小是我们如何最终获得更像鸡蛋的怀孕。

We have big brains and narrow hips. In order to be born, our big brain needs to pass through a set of narrow hips. And that means we have to be born young – very young.  

我们有大的大脑和狭窄的臀部。为了出生，我们的大脑袋需要通过一组狭窄的臀部。而这意味着我们必须在年轻时出生--非常年轻。  

Indeed, we have to be born underdeveloped. To chance a pregnancy any longer than our roughly 40 weeks is to risk death to the mother, baby or both, as a too-big head transits too-small hips.  

的确，我们必须在出生时就发育不良。如果怀孕时间超过40周，就有可能导致母亲、婴儿或双方死亡，因为太大的头穿过太小的臀部。  

Even with our current compromise, we suffer from rates of death in childbirth, for mother and infant, not found in other mammals.  

即使在我们目前的妥协下，我们的母亲和婴儿在分娩时的死亡率是其他哺乳动物所没有的。  

From our brains to our hands to our hips, we cannot rear children like elephants. Our [pregnancies](https://aeon.co/essays/why-pregnancy-is-a-biological-war-between-mother-and-baby) are fundamentally limited in length by our physiology, just like birds’ incubations. In birds, the ultimate limit is egg size through hips, and in humans it is head size through hips.  

从我们的大脑到我们的手到我们的臀部，我们不能像大象一样养育孩子。我们的怀孕从根本上受到我们生理学的限制，就像鸟类的孵化。在鸟类中，最终的限制是通过臀部的鸡蛋大小，而在人类中则是通过臀部的头部大小。  

And so, our babies are helpless, unlike other mammals and very much like birds.  

因此，我们的婴儿是无助的，与其他哺乳动物不同，非常像鸟类。

After birth, or hatching, comes rearing, and here too we are more bird than mammal, at least behaviourally. As a rule, mammal mothers raise their offspring without the involvement of the father.  

在出生或孵化之后，就是养育，在这里我们也是鸟类多于哺乳动物，至少在行为上是如此。通常情况下，哺乳动物的母亲在没有父亲参与的情况下抚养其后代。  

Or at least, without the deep involvement of the father. There are species, like lions, that breed in a harem structure.  

或者至少，没有父亲的深度参与。有一些物种，如狮子，是以后宫结构繁殖的。  

A pride of lions consists of up to a dozen related females, their dependent offspring, and a coalition of two or three resident males, all of whom breed together, and cooperatively hunt, rear offspring and protect the group.  

一个狮群由多达十几只有血缘关系的雌狮、它们所抚养的后代和两到三只常驻雄狮组成的联盟组成，它们一起繁殖，合作狩猎，抚养后代，保护群体。  

Young males reaching maturity leave the pride to start their own.  

达到成熟的年轻雄性离开狮群，开始自己的生活。

Elephants and many [whales](https://aeon.co/videos/a-whale-can-live-50-75-years-its-afterlife-is-equally-long-and-spectacular) live in similar structures of cooperative [females](https://psyche.co/ideas/grey-whales-taught-me-how-to-mother-how-to-endure-how-to-live), with roving males that live alone, mate with the females, and move on.  

大象和许多鲸鱼生活在类似的结构中，雌性合作，雄性游荡，单独生活，与雌性交配，然后继续前进。  

For other mammals, life is even more solitary, with males and females meeting to mate, then the males leaving the female to rear the offspring by herself, as in the case of most [bears](https://aeon.co/videos/how-do-polar-bears-find-their-love-match-flirty-play-in-the-snow-till-they-drop).  

对于其他哺乳动物来说，生活甚至更加孤独，雄性和雌性相遇交配，然后雄性留下雌性自己抚养后代，就像大多数熊的情况。

This reflects the ease of mammalian child-rearing. A mammal mother gives birth to a fairly capable baby that can follow her, walk on its own and supplement its own diet.  

这反映了哺乳动物养育孩子的便利性。哺乳动物的母亲生下一个相当有能力的婴儿，可以跟随她，自己行走，并补充自己的饮食。  

Even the more helpless mammal young, like carnivore cubs or primate babies, which are far less precocious than, say, a baby herd animal like a cow or wildebeest, are far more capable than human newborns.  

即使是更无助的哺乳动物幼崽，如食肉动物幼崽或灵长类动物幼崽，它们远没有像牛或羚羊这样的群居动物幼崽那么早熟，它们的能力也远比人类新生儿强。  

Raising any other mammal is a manageable task for a single parent – and all the more manageable in cooperative breeding structures like lions have.  

养育任何其他哺乳动物对单亲来说都是可控的任务--在狮子这样的合作繁殖结构中更可控。

This also means that male mammals are evolutionarily incentivised to seek as many mating partners as possible.  

这也意味着雄性哺乳动物在进化过程中被激励着去寻求尽可能多的交配伙伴。  

A male elephant is not needed in the rearing of his offspring, so his genes are most effectively reproduced by having as many partners and as many offspring as possible, and investing very little time or effort into each.  

雄象在养育后代的过程中不需要，所以它的基因最有效的繁殖方式是拥有尽可能多的伴侣和尽可能多的后代，并且对每个伴侣投入很少的时间和精力。

He is incentivised to [polygyny](https://aeon.co/essays/how-monotheists-modelled-god-on-a-harem-keeping-alpha-male) – mating with multiple females – and this is exactly what a successful bull elephant does.  

它被激励着进行一夫多妻制--与多只雌象交配--而这正是一头成功的公象所做的。

Not so for humans. Humans are, with exceptions, culturally and socially monogamous.  

人类则不然。除了例外情况，人类在文化和社会上都是一夫一妻制的。  

Frequently sexually monogamous as well – though cheating, or ‘extra-pair copulation’, does certainly happen and has its own evolutionary complexities.  

通常也是一夫一妻制--尽管作弊或 "对外交配 "肯定会发生，而且有其自身的进化复杂性。  

The existence of cheating has led some to argue that human sexuality is naturally disposed to [multiple partners](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-explore-ethical-non-monogamy-with-care-and-kindness) – to polygyny and polyandry – or even to the polygynandry (multiple mating of both sexes) of our close relatives, the chimps and bonobos.  

作弊行为的存在导致一些人认为，人类的性行为自然倾向于多个伴侣--多妻制和一夫多妻制--甚至倾向于我们的近亲黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩的一夫多妻制（两性的多次交配）。

Parents in the smartest avian species stick together to care for their young  

最聪明的鸟类物种的父母粘在一起照顾他们的孩子

They are wrong. Cheating is just that, a manipulation to individual advantage of the default system, and it can survive only in a population of monogamous animals when it is rare.  

他们是错的。作弊就是这样，是对默认系统的个人优势的操纵，它只能在一夫一妻制的动物群体中生存，当它是罕见的。  

If it becomes common, the equilibrium is broken, and the system falls apart entirely.  

如果它变得普遍，平衡就会被打破，系统就会完全崩溃。

Birds are overwhelmingly monogamous. Like humans, many of them do [engage](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/14/4/283) in sporadic extra-pair copulation, though strict monogamy is also common.  

鸟类绝大多数都是一夫一妻制的。像人类一样，许多鸟类确实有零星的对外交配，尽管严格的一夫一妻制也很常见。  

Most species of birds practise at least serial monogamy, staying with one partner for several seasons at a time, before re-pairing.  

大多数种类的鸟类至少实行连续的一夫一妻制，每次与一个伙伴呆上几个季节，然后再重新配对。  

Mating for life is common across many bird groups, but especially so in parrots, songbirds and other intelligent groups.  

终身交配在许多鸟类群体中都很常见，但在鹦鹉、鸣禽和其他智能群体中尤其如此。  

Where non-monogamy occurs, it tends to be in the same groups of nidifugous birds that have easier childrearing – ducks, chickens, ratites and so on.  

在发生非一夫一妻制的地方，往往是在那些更容易养育子女的同一类飞禽中--鸭子、鸡、鼠类等等。

Monogamy is so common in birds because, unlike in mammals, the father can significantly increase his reproductive fitness by taking an active part in the incubation of eggs and the rearing of young.  

一夫一妻制在鸟类中非常普遍，因为与哺乳动物不同，父亲可以通过积极参与孵化蛋和养育幼鸟来大大增加其生殖能力。  

The female bird has to make the bigger investment in gametes: the egg itself is a draining thing for her to produce from her body.  

雌鸟必须对配子进行更大的投资：鸡蛋本身对她来说是一个耗费体力的东西，要从她的身体中产生。  

But once it is laid, there is little difference in its being sat on by a mother or a father.  

但是，一旦下了蛋，它被母亲或父亲坐在上面，就没有什么区别。  

In some birds, like the common pigeon (or ‘rock dove’), this incubation is shared straightforwardly: the mother and father split the day, with one sitting on the eggs in the morning while the other forages, then swapping in the afternoon.  

在一些鸟类中，如普通鸽子（或 "岩鸽"），这种孵化是直接分享的：母亲和父亲分担一天的工作，其中一个在上午坐在蛋上，另一个则在下午进行觅食，然后交换。  

They keep up this even split throughout the egg incubation and the several months afterwards of looking after the helpless hatchling. Others, like swans or some parrots, make a different bargain.  

他们在整个蛋的孵化过程中和之后照顾无助的雏鸟的几个月里，一直保持着这种平均分配。其他人，如天鹅或一些鹦鹉，则做了不同的交易。  

Here, the female will do all the egg-sitting, while the male stands by, on guard to ward off predators, watch the nest when she needs to make short foraging trips and, in some species, bring her food and feed her.  

在这里，雌鸟会做所有的坐蛋工作，而雄鸟则站在一旁，守候着抵御天敌，在雌鸟需要短途觅食的时候看着鸟巢，在某些物种中，还会给雌鸟带来食物，给它喂食。  

Once the young hatch, both parents gather food and feed the babies. Either way, parents in the smartest avian species stick together to care for their young.  

一旦幼鸟孵化，父母双方都会收集食物并喂养幼鸟。无论是哪种方式，最聪明的鸟类的父母都会粘在一起照顾他们的孩子。  

Helpless babies require biparental care, and biparental care requires monogamous mating to work.  

无助的婴儿需要双亲的照顾，而双亲的照顾需要一夫一妻制的交配才能发挥作用。

Humans are no different. Of course, in the modern world, a combination of technology, government assistance and social structures makes single-parenting possible.  

人类也不例外。当然，在现代世界，技术、政府援助和社会结构的结合使单亲家庭成为可能。  

In pre-modern societies, and especially in our evolutionary history, trying to raise a child as a single mother was a sentence of extreme poverty or much worse.  

在前现代社会，特别是在我们的进化史上，试图以单身母亲的身份抚养孩子是一种极端贫困或更糟糕的判决。  

(Human babies are so much work that one theory holds that menopause exists to provide [grandmothers](https://aeon.co/essays/why-childhood-and-old-age-are-key-to-our-human-capacities) for assistance in raising the young. In other mammals, females remain fertile up until shortly before their death – a grandmother elephant cannot babysit her daughter’s children: she is likely to have her own.)  

(人类的婴儿是如此之多的工作，以至于有一种理论认为，绝经期的存在是为了让祖母们协助抚养孩子。在其他哺乳动物中，雌性动物直到死亡前不久仍有生育能力--大象祖母不能照看她女儿的孩子：她很可能会有自己的孩子）。

As with birds, human monogamy is the evolutionary response to our need for biparental care of children.  

与鸟类一样，人类的一夫一妻制是对我们需要双亲照顾孩子的进化反应。  

A baby human needs a father around in order to have enough parental support to get it through our extraordinarily long childhood. Monogamy keeps that father around.  

一个人类婴儿需要一个父亲在身边，以便有足够的父母支持，让他度过我们超长的童年。一夫一妻制使这个父亲留在身边。

This is why exceptions to monogamy tend to cluster around the wealthy and elite – economic or social power offers other solutions to the problem of childrearing, among them a harem or polygamous marriage, nannies or, indeed, slaves.  

这就是为什么一夫一妻制的例外情况往往集中在富人和精英身上--经济或社会权力为抚养孩子的问题提供了其他解决方案，其中包括后宫或一夫多妻制的婚姻、保姆或实际上的奴隶。  

With these artificial sources of childrearing help, men of wealth and status could break from nature in a way that others could not.  

有了这些人为的育儿帮助，有财富和地位的人可以以一种其他人无法做到的方式脱离自然。  

The complexity of human society has allowed us to depart from the behaviours we evolved to practise, but our underlying biology, and the forces that shaped it, remain.  

人类社会的复杂性使我们能够偏离我们进化后的行为，但我们的基本生物学，以及塑造它的力量，仍然存在。  

We are a monogamous species like our doppelgängers, the birds.  

我们是一个一夫一妻制的物种，就像我们的二重奏--鸟类。

All of this comes back to the fundamental idea of trade-offs in evolution. No adaptation is free, and every area of exceptional ability is equal parts benefit and limitation.  

所有这些都回到了进化中权衡的基本思想。没有任何适应是免费的，每个领域的特殊能力都是利益和限制并存的。  

Dinosaurs had evolved the great advantages of massive size and heavy, robust build: huge advantages, no doubt.  

恐龙进化出了巨大的体型和沉重、健壮的身材的巨大优势：毫无疑问，是巨大的优势。  

But they traded them both away when they became birds, exchanging them for the contradictory but still more revolutionary benefit of [flight](https://aeon.co/videos/flight-manifest-from-take-off-to-landing-a-birds-eye-introduction-to-flying). Humans have done much the same with our original, game-changing mammalian pregnancy.  

但是当他们成为鸟类时，他们把这两样东西都换走了，用它们来换取飞行这一矛盾但更具有革命性的好处。人类对我们最初的、改变游戏规则的哺乳动物怀孕也做了同样的事情。  

Easy, well-developed, self-sufficient offspring were a great boon to our ancestors, but lost out in the trade-off for big, world-changing brains.  

轻松、发育良好、自给自足的后代是我们祖先的一大福音，但在与改变世界的大脑袋的交换中失去了。  

We have come full circle, shedding the evolutionary advantages of pregnancy and easy childrearing for a very egglike set of constraints on our gestation.  

我们已经绕了一圈，摆脱了怀孕和容易养育孩子的进化优势，换来了一套非常像鸡蛋的对我们妊娠的限制。  

With our pregnancies turned egglike, it is no surprise that our behaviours and our families have turned birdlike as well.  

随着我们的怀孕变得像鸡蛋一样，我们的行为和我们的家庭也变得像鸟一样，这一点也不奇怪。

This February marks five years since quitting my corporate 9-5 job and jumping into [indie hacking](https://www.indiehackers.com/start) full time.  

今年2月是我辞去公司朝九晚五的工作，全身心投入独立黑客事业的5年。

Five years always felt like an important benchmark for my journey. Therefore, I wanted to take time to share the three biggest things I've learned so far, as well as reflect on my progress.  

五年来，我总觉得是我旅程中的一个重要基准。因此，我想花时间分享我迄今为止学到的三个最大的东西，以及反思我的进步。

## **Lessons Learned**

### **Passion is a Double-Edged Sword  

激情是一把双刃剑**

My original foray into indie hacking was the result of my passion project, [Fantasy Congress](https://fantasycongress.com/). Without my strong love for this idea, I would have never taken the jump to pursue entrepreneurship.  

我最初进入独立黑客领域是我的激情项目《幻想大会》的结果。如果没有我对这个想法的强烈热爱，我就不会跳出来追求创业。

Alas, in many ways, I feel my passion for this project also prevented it from being more successful.  

唉，在许多方面，我觉得我对这个项目的热情也妨碍了它的成功。

Passion is an _internal_ experience. But building a successful business relies heavily on _external_ stimuli, like customer feedback. If you're consumed by passion, you will inoculate yourself to the feedback and needs of the outside world.  

激情是一种内部体验。但建立一个成功的企业在很大程度上依赖于外部刺激，如客户反馈。如果你被激情所吞噬，你就会使自己对外界的反馈和需求免疫。

Like a mad scientist, I was committed to _my vision_ for Fantasy Congress in the beginning. I had a one track mind, and this prevented me from course correcting or honestly reflecting on my circumstances.  

就像一个疯狂的科学家，我一开始就致力于我对幻想国会的愿景。我有一个单线思维，这使我无法纠正方向或诚实地反思我的情况。

I spent a whole year building the wrong product. Eventually I realized if I wanted to see this idea succeed, my vision and desires had to be set aside.  

我花了整整一年时间来打造错误的产品。最终我意识到，如果我想看到这个想法成功，我的愿景和欲望就必须放在一边。

This changed some things. Most of all my motivation. I lost some of my gusto for the project, and eventually burned out.  

这改变了一些事情。最重要的是我的动力。我失去了对这个项目的一些热情，并最终烧毁了。

This isn't to say passion is bad. On the contrary, you need _some_ amount of passion or delusion to motivate you to start a business. It's fucking hard! _Especially_ without funding or co-founders.  

这并不是说激情是不好的。相反，你需要一定量的激情或妄想来激励你创业。这他妈的太难了!特别是在没有资金或联合创始人的情况下。

But passion alone won't sustain you.  

但光有激情是无法支撑你的。

Moreover, intense passion is probably more of a hindrance than an asset.  

此外，强烈的激情可能是一种阻碍，而不是一种财富。

In my opinion, the indie projects most likely to succeed are the ones where founders _aren't_ wildly passionate about the product or its subject matter (aka, "boring businesses"). It helps them maintain objectivity and flexibility as their problem, product, and market evolve.  

在我看来，最有可能成功的独立项目是那些创始人对产品或其主题并不狂热的项目（也就是 "无聊的生意"）。这有助于他们在问题、产品和市场的演变中保持客观性和灵活性。

### **You Can't Get Away From People  

你离不开人**

Many are drawn to bootstrapping as a way to "maximize" their freedom. In my particular case, I was looking to free myself from others.  

许多人被吸引到自导自演，作为一种 "最大化 "他们自由的方式。在我的特殊情况下，我想把自己从别人那里解放出来。

After a few years working in the corporate world, I longed for hyper-independence.  

在企业界工作了几年后，我渴望获得超强的独立性。

The illusion of meritocracy had faded. I realized water-cooler politics had a bigger effect on my day-to-day tasks and overall career than I expected. There was so much more to work than _just doing the work_. And I hated it.  

任人唯贤的假象已经消失了。我意识到水冷政治对我的日常工作和整个职业生涯的影响比我预期的要大。工作中除了做工作之外，还有很多东西。而我却讨厌这样。

I thought the fix would be working by myself, for myself. And this is where my interest in bootstrapping came from.  

我认为解决的办法是自己为自己工作。这就是我对引导的兴趣的来源。

Using my skills, if I had enough time and money to support myself, couldn't I just build a successful product all on my own?  

利用我的技能，如果我有足够的时间和金钱来养活自己，难道我就不能自己建立一个成功的产品吗？  

I imagined solitary days happily chipping away at features and bugs, free from the pressure and politics of corporate culture.  

我想象着独处的日子，快乐地削除功能和错误，摆脱企业文化的压力和政治。

But I soon realized that building a business harbors its own form of social pressures. In many ways, you become _more_ involved with people when you work for yourself.  

但我很快意识到，建立一个企业蕴藏着自己的社会压力。在许多方面，当你为自己工作时，你会更多地与人交往。

Much of this comes in the form of relationships. Relationships with customers, vendors, contractors, industry influencers, competitors, and if you're lucky, eventually employees.  

这其中大部分是以关系的形式出现的。与客户、供应商、承包商、行业影响者、竞争对手的关系，以及如果你幸运的话，最终与员工的关系。

Starting out, I thought bootstrapping meant freedom from the messy complications of building and maintaining relationships. Turns out, it's just the opposite.  

开始时，我以为自举意味着从建立和维护关系的混乱复杂中获得自由。结果发现，情况恰恰相反。

One of the biggest struggles I faced on my journey was "you don't know what you don't know." That is to say, you might _know_ you're missing a piece to the puzzle, but you _don't know_ what that piece looks like yet.  

在我的旅程中，我面临的最大的挣扎之一是 "你不知道你不知道的事情"。这就是说，你可能知道你缺少一块拼图，但你还不知道那块拼图是什么样子。

As a true beginner, I didn't know where or how to gather information on building a business. I had Google, but I didn't know what to search, or which information was trustworthy.  

作为一个真正的初学者，我不知道在哪里或如何收集关于建立一个企业的信息。我有谷歌，但我不知道该搜索什么，或者哪些信息是值得信赖的。

There's an iconic scene from HBO's Silicon Valley where the main character is trying to learn how to write a business plan, and the camera pans to him staring blankly at the Wikipedia page for "Business Plan." I snickered at that scene initially.  

HBO的《硅谷》中有一个标志性的场景，主角正试图学习如何写一份商业计划书，镜头转到他茫然地盯着维基百科上的 "商业计划书 "页面。最初我对这个场景嗤之以鼻。  

Then, I lived it. 💀  

然后，我就活了下来。💀

The turning point occurred when I stumbled upon some Twitter users who were also trying to build self-funded businesses (or "bootstrapping" as they called it).  

转折点发生在我偶然发现一些Twitter用户也在尝试建立自筹资金的企业（或他们称之为 "自营"）。

Following these people introduced me to relevant podcasts, influential books, and a host of other credible creators to follow. Finally, I started to learn the lingo and concepts of business building.  

跟随这些人，我看到了相关的播客、有影响力的书籍，以及许多其他可信的创作者，可以跟随。最后，我开始学习业务建设的行话和概念。  

But most importantly, I learned _why_ many of my initial choices were mistakes.  

但最重要的是，我了解到为什么我最初的许多选择是错误的。

Surrounding myself with people doing the thing I wanted to do, helped me learn even when I wasn't trying.  

与做我想做的事情的人在一起，帮助我学习，即使在我不努力的时候。

Just listening to someone's story or general banter about their project, might expose me to a new marketing tactic, or a better on-boarding strategy, or a tool to help speed up my development workflow.  

仅仅听一个人的故事或关于他们项目的一般性戏谑，就可能让我发现一个新的营销策略，或一个更好的入职策略，或一个帮助我加快开发工作流程的工具。  

It also gave me a wider breadth of experience to draw on when I faced new problems.  

这也让我在面临新问题时有了更广泛的经验可以借鉴。

For a long time, I thought the benefits of "community" were purely social. The past five years taught me that a community is actually a valuable learning resource.  

长期以来，我认为 "社区 "的好处是纯粹的社交。过去的五年告诉我，社区实际上是一种宝贵的学习资源。  

Sometimes, your peers are the best teachers.  

有时，你的同龄人是最好的老师。

## **Was it worth it?  

这值得吗？**

Though I've spent five years working on my own businesses, they still don't make a substantial income.  

虽然我已经花了五年时间在自己的企业上工作，但它们仍然没有赚取可观的收入。

With the launch of my second business last July (a programmatic SEO tool called [PageFactory](https://pagefactory.app/)), I _finally_ started generating enough consistent revenue to pay myself a meager salary. After five long years, I now make $1k/month.  

随着去年7月我的第二项业务（一个名为PageFactory的程序化搜索引擎工具）的推出，我终于开始产生足够的稳定收入，以支付自己微薄的工资。经过漫长的五年，我现在每月能挣到1千美元。

And this realization is...disappointing.  

而这种认识是......令人失望的。

My brain knows that starting a business is not a linear journey. That 99% percent of people are not overnight successes.  

我的大脑知道，创业不是一个线性旅程。99%的人不是一夜之间就能成功的。  

And that most people take many years, and many failed ventures, to eventually build a sustainable, profitable business.  

大多数人花了很多年时间，经历了很多失败的冒险，最终建立了一个可持续的、可盈利的企业。

But my heart is...a little crushed. Five years is a long time! I gave up a lot in my life to keep pursuing the indie hacker dream, and so far the monetary results _have not_ been worth it! 😆  

但我的心......有点崩溃了。五年是一段很长的时间！我放弃了我生命中的很多东西来继续追求独立黑客的梦想！为了继续追求独立黑客的梦想，我放弃了生活中的很多东西，到目前为止，金钱上的结果并不值得！ 😆

And yet, am I ready to give up?  

然而，我准备放弃了吗？

No.

There's definitely a lot of things I wish I'd done differently. For instance, I wouldn't encourage anyone to quit their job until they've made at least _one dollar_ selling a product or service online. Alas, hindsight is 20/20 right?  

肯定有很多事情我希望我以不同的方式来做。例如，我不鼓励任何人辞职，直到他们在网上销售产品或服务至少赚到一美元。唉，事后诸葛亮是20/20吧？

More than anything though, I'm so thankful I had the courage, and privilege, to take a swing at this.  

但更重要的是，我非常感谢我有勇气，也有特权，能在这个问题上一搏。

I don't know if I'll stay on this path forever, but I can't imagine doing anything else. Maybe I'm not where I _thought_ I'd be in five years, but I’m content with where I landed.  

我不知道我是否会永远停留在这条道路上，但我无法想象做其他事情。也许我没有达到我所想的五年后的目标，但我对我的落脚点感到满意。

Focus Groups. Surveys. Segmenting our customer data. Segmenting competitors’ customer data. Digging through people’s smartphone data.  

焦点小组。调查。对我们的客户数据进行细分。细分竞争对手的客户数据。挖掘人们的智能手机数据。

The modern tech product company wants to be data driven—and they’ll do whatever they can to get their hands on that data.   

现代科技产品公司希望以数据为导向--他们会不惜一切代价来获得这些数据。

Compare that to the approach that produced the unicorn companies of the late nineties: your eBays and your Amazons, for example. The archetypical founding story?  

与产生九十年代末独角兽公司的方法相比，例如，你们的易趣网和亚马逊。典型的创始故事是什么？  

Some guy—admittedly it’s usually some wealthy, well-connected guy, but some guy nonetheless—thought up a thing that he wanted for himself.  

有些人--诚然，通常是一些富有的、有关系的人，但还是有些人--想出了一个他自己想要的东西。  

It turned out that the world wanted it, too, to the tune of billions of dollars.   

事实证明，世界也想要它，而且是数十亿美元的金额。

Why aren’t the unicorn companies of 2023 talking about how some dude in his garage wanted a thing for himself in 2013?  

为什么2023年的独角兽公司不谈论2013年某个车库里的家伙如何为自己想要一个东西？

The answer derives from who built the internet of today, and who they built it for.   

答案来自于谁建造了今天的互联网，以及他们为谁建造了它。

## Innovation serves unmet needs  

创新服务于未满足的需求

An innovative product breaks the market for existing solutions. And this is important: it usually doesn’t just serve a need better than other solutions serve it.  

一个创新产品打破了现有解决方案的市场。这一点很重要：它通常不只是比其他解决方案更好地满足一个需求。  

Instead, it serves a need that other solutions don’t serve at all.   

相反，它满足了其他解决方案根本无法满足的需求。

Let’s look at some examples.  

让我们看看一些例子。

eBay used reputational scores to connect buyers and sellers who did not know each other and have stuff actually get paid for and delivered—across time and space!  

eBay利用信誉评分将互不相识的买家和卖家联系起来，并让东西真正得到支付和交付--跨越时间和空间！这就是eBay！  

Until the early internet, sales had to be colocated, and even _after_ the internet they carried the risk of some faceless website stealing your money and never sending the thing you ordered. At the time, no mainstream solution did this.  

在早期的互联网之前，销售必须在同一地点进行，即使在互联网之后，他们也面临着一些不露面的网站窃取你的钱财和永远不发送你订购的东西的风险。在当时，没有一个主流的解决方案能做到这一点。

Amazon added a logistical system that made ordering things over the internet not only reliable, but also relatively fast.  

亚马逊增加了一个物流系统，使通过互联网订购东西不仅可靠，而且相对快速。  

No more waiting three weeks for John in Ohio to ship your CrazyTown album sticker via snail mail.  

不再需要等待三个星期，让俄亥俄州的约翰通过蜗牛邮件运送你的CrazyTown专辑贴纸。  

To this day, for better or worse, Amazon offers a more streamlined, reliable online purchasing infrastructure for many products than even the sites of the shops that create the things they’re selling.  

时至今日，无论好坏，亚马逊为许多产品提供了一个更精简、更可靠的在线购买基础设施，甚至比创造他们所销售的东西的商店的网站还要好。

When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, no other phone offered the opportunity for different apps to have different input interfaces.  

当苹果在2007年发布iPhone时，没有其他手机提供不同的应用程序有不同的输入界面的机会。  

Its introduction more or less broke the market for existing phones.   

它的推出或多或少打破了现有手机的市场。

In the days of the early internet, unserved needs were easy to find: until then, commerce had to happen either in person or via snail mail and phonecalls.  

在早期的互联网时代，未得到服务的需求很容易找到：在那之前，商业活动必须亲自进行，或者通过蜗牛邮件和电话进行。  

Quick, self-service, asynchronous options simply did not exist. The web made it _possible_ for them to exist. It more or less dumped a whole vat of krill into the waters of commercial demand for companies to snap up without having to be that creative.  

快速、自助服务、异步选择根本不存在。网络使它们的存在成为可能。它或多或少地将一整桶磷虾倾倒在商业需求的水面上，让公司不需要那么多创意就能抢购。

Now, those krill have largely been eaten. The easy wins have been won. Online commerce is a saturated business.  

现在，这些磷虾已经基本上被吃掉了。轻松的胜利已经赢得了。在线商务是一个饱和的业务。  

The commercial web’s early garage founders built the things they wanted, and now the things that that demographic wants have been built.   

商业网络的早期车库创始人建造了他们想要的东西，而现在该人群想要的东西已经被建造出来。

Focus groups, surveys, segmented customer data, segmented competitor customer data, smartphone data—today’s product and marketing teams lean heavily on these resources to find the tiniest capillary opportunities for monetization within that demographic.  

焦点小组、调查、细分的客户数据、细分的竞争对手客户数据、智能手机数据--今天的产品和营销团队在很大程度上依靠这些资源来寻找该人群中最微小的毛细血管的货币化机会。

Innovation means, pragmatically, serving a heretofore unserved need. Those are hard to find among the people that the internet was built for.  

实事求是地讲，创新意味着为迄今尚未得到服务的需求提供服务。在互联网为之建立的人群中很难找到这样的人。  

The problem lies in the fact that the product and marketing teams’ sources of data—people who do focus groups and fill out surveys from their smartphones, people who already use the product or a competitor’s product or a variety of smartphone apps—_come from_ the people that the internet was built for. These people have few unserved needs online.   

问题在于，产品和营销团队的数据来源--做焦点小组和用智能手机填写调查问卷的人，已经使用该产品或竞争对手的产品或各种智能手机应用程序的人--来自于互联网为之建立的人群。这些人在网上几乎没有未被满足的需求。

## In search of the unserved need  

寻找未被满足的需求

So where can we find the unserved needs—the opportunities to innovate? It will sound too basic to be true when I say it: we have to talk to folks that _don’t_ enjoy an internet built for them. We can’t find them among folks already well-represented in boardrooms, product teams, and pools of active customers.  

那么，我们在哪里可以找到未被满足的需求--创新的机会？当我说这句话时，听起来太基本了：我们必须与那些没有享受到为他们建立的互联网的人交谈。我们不能在那些已经在董事会、产品团队和活跃客户群中得到充分代表的人中找到他们。  

Instead, visionary products derive directly from centering people at the margins of modern technology.   

相反，有远见的产品直接来自于以现代技术边缘的人为中心。

That doesn’t _sound_ like it would be a profitable strategy, does it? Our instinct on this tends to get hindered by two flawed assumptions.  

这听起来不像是一个有利可图的策略，不是吗？我们在这方面的直觉往往会被两个有缺陷的假设所阻碍。

Flawed Assumption #1: “Marginalized folks constitute a minority of our potential customers.”  

有缺陷的假设1："被边缘化的人在我们的潜在客户中只占少数"。

This is just flatly incorrect in a lot of cases. Take a look at the difference in uptake by race for online money transfer companies [CashApp and Venmo](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/08/payment-apps-like-venmo-and-cash-app-bring-convenience-and-security-concerns-to-some-users/). These two companies do not differ in size by orders of magnitude.  

这在很多情况下是完全不正确的。看看在线汇款公司CashApp和Venmo的种族差异吧。这两家公司的规模并没有数量级的差异。  

A Venmo employee might say of the company’s numbers “That’s just who wants/needs a money transfer app.” And they’d be, candidly, wrong.  

Venmo的员工可能会说该公司的数字 "这只是谁想要/需要一个汇款应用程序"。坦率地说，他们是错的。  

Flawed Assumption #2: “Pursuing solutions in underserved populations will cost us demand from existing customers or larger demographics.”   

有缺陷的假设2："在服务不足的人群中追求解决方案将使我们失去现有客户或更大人口群体的需求。"

This would be true if the needs of the two groups were mutually exclusive, but they’re often complementary. My favorite example of this is the same 2007 iPhone introduction I mentioned above.  

如果这两个群体的需求是相互排斥的，那就对了，但它们往往是互补的。我最喜欢的例子是我上面提到的2007年的iPhone介绍。  

The star feature of that phone—the multi-touch capacitative screen that facilitates different interfaces for different apps—was not an Apple invention.  

该手机的明星功能--为不同应用程序提供不同界面的多点触控电容屏--并非苹果的发明。  

Apple got that screen by acquiring FingerWorks, a small company founded by John Elias and Wayne Westerman to distribute a computer input device Westerman had designed to help his mother, who lost much of her fine motor function, to continue to do the activities she wanted to do on her computer.  

苹果公司通过收购FingerWorks公司获得了这块屏幕。FingerWorks公司是由约翰-埃利亚斯和韦恩-韦斯特曼创办的一家小公司，负责销售韦斯特曼设计的电脑输入设备，以帮助他失去大部分精细运动功能的母亲继续在电脑上做她想做的事情。  

Indeed, you’d be floored by the number of your favorite technological features that _started_ as accessibility features for people with disabilities.   

事实上，你会对你最喜欢的技术功能的数量感到吃惊，这些技术功能最初是为残疾人提供的无障碍功能。

Now, reams have been written about how to get marginalized people into the room on product decisions.  

现在，关于如何让被边缘化的人进入产品决策的房间，已经写了很多。  

Tech companies individually tend to experience intermittent hiccups of trying really hard on that, but as an industry as a whole, the situation ain’t great.  

科技公司个人倾向于经历间歇性的努力打嗝，但作为一个行业的整体，情况并不乐观。  

No number of DEI trainings seems to manage to _keep_ a diverse team. And I maintain that the reason for this is that, as not-racist, not-sexist, or not-ableist as individuals _want_ to be, we run into two things:  

似乎没有多少DEI培训能够保持一个多元化的团队。我坚持认为，其原因在于，尽管个人想成为非种族主义者、非性别歧视者或非能力歧视者，但我们遇到了两件事：

1.  There is _so much_ to learn about _so many_ axes of marginalization, that a single corporate training could not possibly completely inform and educate about all of them.  
    
    关于这么多边缘化的轴线，有很多东西需要学习，单一的企业培训不可能完全告知和教育所有这些东西。
2.  An equitable environment that welcomes diversity requires its members to have a complement of _skills_, but most training on the matter focuses on _values_ or _demographic groups_ rather than skills, leaving folks unequipped to uncover and examine unserved and underserved needs that technology could address.  
    
    一个欢迎多样性的公平环境要求其成员具备各种技能，但大多数关于这个问题的培训都集中在价值观或人口群体上，而不是技能上，使人们没有能力发现和审查技术可以解决的未得到服务和未得到充分服务的需求。

Teams can facilitate an inclusive environment and increase their capacity to sniff out unserved needs by explicitly practicing that complement of skills in their work. Some of these get _touched_ on in DEI trainings, but they form the foundation of creating a team where _everyone_ experiences positive changes in their opportunity to contribute. I have [written before about building an employee evaluation rubric](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/05/24/why-your-efforts-to-make-your-company-inclusive-arent-working/) for what I see as the critical five:  

团队可以通过在工作中明确练习这些技能的补充，来促进一个包容性的环境，并提高他们的能力，以嗅出未得到的需求。其中一些在DEI培训中被提及，但它们构成了创建一个团队的基础，在这个团队中，每个人都能体验到他们作出贡献的机会的积极变化。我曾经写过关于建立一个员工评估标准的文章，我认为这是关键的五个方面：

### **1\. Moderation**

This is the skill of giving folks in a meeting the opportunity to listen by protecting their opportunities to speak.  

这是一种技巧，通过保护人们的发言机会，让他们在会议上有机会倾听。  

Without this, teams run into all kinds of icky demographic patterns governing who gets to talk in meetings, and it’s often not the people with the most thought-out ideas.  

如果没有这一点，团队就会遇到各种恶心的人口统计模式，支配着谁在会议上发言，而且往往不是那些有最多想法的人。  

That’s why moderation is such a critical skill—especially for leadership of an innovative team. You _need_ people’s ideas, and that requires the skill of uncovering them in groups.   

这就是为什么节制是如此关键的技能--特别是对于创新团队的领导。你需要人们的想法，而这需要在群体中发掘它们的技巧。

### 2\. Soliciting opinions  

2.征求意见

There’s also skill associated with uncovering ideas _individually_, and identifying who to ask for those ideas. It includes thinking specifically about who will be affected by a decision, and seeking them out for input.  

还有一种技能是单独发掘想法，并确定向谁征求这些想法。它包括具体思考谁会受到某个决定的影响，并寻求他们的意见。  

It also includes identifying which perspectives would _disagree_ with those making the decision, and explicitly _soliciting_ those objections to avoid running into obstacles later on that could have been predicted.   

它还包括确定哪些观点会与做出决定的人持不同意见，并明确征求这些反对意见，以避免后来遇到本可以预测的障碍。

### **3\. Attribution**

This often feels like a small skill, but it has a huge impact. It’s common in tech for folks to misattribute ideas, forget where they heard them, or fail to recall who taught them something they know.  

这常常被认为是一个小技能，但它有巨大的影响。在技术领域，人们经常把想法归错，忘记在哪里听到的，或者不记得谁教给他们的东西。  

In the aggregate, this makes folks less likely to share their ideas out of concern that they’ll lose credit for them. It’s especially true among underrepresented groups, but it can happen to anyone.  

总的来说，这使得人们不太可能分享他们的想法，因为担心他们会失去信用。这在代表性不足的群体中尤其真实，但它可能发生在任何人身上。  

A team that cares about attribution, and practices making it regularly, facilitates earlier and more open idea sharing.  

一个关心归属问题的团队，并定期进行实践，有利于更早、更开放地分享想法。

### **4\. Most advanced assumption  

4.最先进的假设**

It’s easy to accidentally condescend to others in the workplace and give the impression that we think other people are less capable than we are.  

在工作场所，我们很容易不小心居高临下地对待他人，给人的印象是我们认为其他人的能力比我们差。  

We want to share what we know, and sometimes the unintentional result of that is that we lecture someone who knows more than we do. This makes folks feel like we don’t respect their valuable expertise.  

我们想分享我们所知道的，而有时无意中的结果是我们教训了一个比我们知道得更多的人。这让人们觉得我们不尊重他们宝贵的专业知识。

And if we don’t respect it, why should they share it?   

如果我们不尊重它，他们为什么要分享它？

This is another one that feels small but makes an outsize impact. It’s also tricky to broach a topic when we don’t _know_ the level of expertise of others in the conversation. But we can learn to ask questions about that.  

这是另一个感觉很小但影响很大的问题。当我们不知道对话中其他人的专业知识水平时，提出一个话题也是很棘手的。但是，我们可以学会询问这方面的问题。  

We can also learn to share knowledge with explicit consent to be stopped if an interlocutor already knows, or if we assume too much knowledge and they have questions.   

我们也可以学习在明确同意的情况下分享知识，如果对话者已经知道，或者我们假设了太多的知识，而他们有疑问，就可以停止。

### 5\. Capitalizing on alternative perspectives  

5.利用替代观点

We’re a conflict-avoidant culture: we’ll go to great lengths to skirt disagreement.  

我们是一种避免冲突的文化：我们会不遗余力地回避分歧。  

But disagreement often signals and precedes conversations that result in more complete solutions that better serve unserved needs.  

但是，分歧往往预示着对话，并在对话之前产生更完整的解决方案，更好地满足未得到服务的需求。  

Developing a more positive attitude about disagreement requires tools for navigating it more comfortably and with more grace for each other.  

培养对分歧更积极的态度，需要有工具来更舒适地驾驭它，并对彼此更宽容。  

And that, like the other four items discussed above, is a skill that can be taught, learned, and practiced.  

而这和上面讨论的其他四项一样，是一种可以被教授、学习和练习的技能。

Those skills all have a lot of nuance in them, and I have not explained exactly where to get it.  

这些技能都有很多细微的差别在里面，我还没有解释到底从哪里得到。  

I’m working on an online, self-paced workshop with exercises in it to help technologists like you create and lead teams that can, in fact, innovate. You can [pre-order that course right here](https://chelseatroy.thinkific.com/courses/leading-an-inclusive-technical-team) (and, if you want proof of my teaching chops, [this course on tech debt](https://chelseatroy.thinkific.com/courses/technical-debt-an-analytical-approach) is already up and available).  

我正在开发一个在线的、自定进度的研讨会，其中有一些练习，以帮助像你这样的技术专家创建和领导事实上能够创新的团队。你可以在这里预购该课程（如果你想证明我的教学能力，这个关于技术债务的课程已经推出，可以使用）。

But the takeaway here revolves around where innovation comes from. We can employ skills—individual, interpersonal skills—to create the kind of environment that _makes innovation possible_, even in a tech sector that often looks bleakly saturated.  

但这里的启示是围绕着创新的来源。我们可以运用技能--个人的、人际的技能--创造一种使创新成为可能的环境，即使是在一个经常看起来暗淡饱和的技术部门。  

There’s hope for us, hope for our teams, and hope for our industry if we can learn to execute on our curiosity about the unmet needs we can build for.   

如果我们能够学会执行我们对未满足的需求的好奇心，我们就有希望，我们的团队有希望，我们的行业也有希望。

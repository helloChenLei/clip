When I was a new PM, I had no idea what made more senior PMs different from me.  

当我是一个新的PM时，我不知道是什么让更多的高级PM与我不同。

I wrote specs, they wrote specs.  

我写规范，他们写规范。

I wrote 1-pagers on what we should build in the next release, they did too.  

我写了一篇关于我们应该在下一个版本中建立什么的文章，他们也写了。

Even the strategy documents that VPs sent out seemed like they were just specs for a broader scope (a product instead of a feature).  

即使是副总裁发出的战略文件，似乎也只是范围更广的规格（一个产品而不是一个功能）。

And so, I assumed career growth was like one straight line.  

因此，我认为职业发展就像一条直线。  

The career guides with their grids of skill by levels reinforced the idea that we all had the same job and skills, just at different levels of mastery.  

职业指南中按等级划分的技能网格强化了这样的想法：我们都有相同的工作和技能，只是掌握的水平不同。  

I thought I’d get better and better at shipping products until I was promoted to lead, GPM, VP, and eventually, CEO.  

我以为我在运送产品方面会越来越好，直到我被提升为领导，GPM，副总裁，最后是CEO。

That’s a very misleading mental model. I was missing all of the other work those senior PMs and VPs did. Most of their work happened outside of the meetings I was invited too.  

这是一个非常具有误导性的心理模式。我错过了那些高级项目经理和副总裁所做的所有其他工作。他们的大部分工作都发生在我被邀请参加的会议之外。  

When I was a manager at Asana, I realized that many of my reports had the same mistaken mental model.  

当我在Asana担任经理时，我意识到我的许多报告都有同样错误的心理模式。

I wanted to make sense of what it really takes to succeed in product. Shreyas Doshi’s [Scope/Impact matrix](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1399067340822618112?lang=en) really resonated with me. As you advance in your career, you sometimes get better at your job, and sometimes expand your scope. Every time your scope increases you go back to being a beginner.  

You’re not as good at your new job, and you can feel it.  

我想弄清楚在产品方面取得成功的真正原因。Shreyas Doshi的范围/影响矩阵真的让我产生了共鸣。当你在职业生涯中不断进步时，你有时会在工作中变得更好，有时会扩大你的范围。每当你的范围扩大时，你又回到了初学者的状态。你在新的工作上没有那么好，你可以感觉到。

But, what did it mean to expand your scope? Was it just being put in charge of a larger team?  

但是，扩大你的范围意味着什么？难道只是被派去负责一个更大的团队？  

As I looked into it, I realized that the differentiator wasn’t exactly the scope of the product you owned, but rather the brand new responsibilities (and accompanying expectations) that you pick up as you advance.  

当我研究的时候，我意识到差异化并不完全是你所拥有的产品的范围，而是你在前进过程中所承担的全新的责任（以及伴随的期望）。  

In fact, the entire definition of being “great” changes at each stage.  

事实上，"伟大 "的整个定义在每个阶段都有变化。

The entire definition of being “great” changes at each stage  

成为 "伟大 "的整个定义在每个阶段都有变化

There are three stages of a career in product.  

产品的职业生涯有三个阶段。

Shipping Products covers the first half, Product Strategy covers from 25% to 75% and Organizational excellence covers the last half.")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F690ab677-e078-462e-9b86-9022407b88da_960x540.png)

The first stage is shipping products. This is where the day-to-day product lifecycle work happens: Discover, Define, Design, Develop, Deliver, Debrief.  

第一阶段是运送产品。这是日常的产品生命周期工作发生的地方：发现、定义、设计、开发、交付、汇报。

In this stage, a great PM ships products that delight customers and hit the business goals.  

在这一阶段，一个伟大的项目管理人员所交付的产品能够让客户满意并达到商业目标。

As an intern, APM, PM 1, and PM 2, this is probably your whole job. You’ll get better and better at shipping products. But, at some point you’ll start to plateau.  

作为一个实习生、APM、PM1和PM2，这可能是你的全部工作。你会在运送产品方面变得越来越好。但是，在某些时候，你会开始出现高原反应。  

Just getting better at product sense, analytical skills, and execution won’t get you to Senior PM. And that’s because at Senior PM, the job changes.  

仅仅在产品意识、分析技能和执行方面做得更好，并不能让你成为高级项目经理。这是因为在高级项目经理那里，工作内容发生了变化。

At Senior PM, you pick up a new responsibility. Before, you were told what to work on. Now it’s your responsibility to identify _new_ opportunities and put together a plan for how to win them. You’ll still need to ship products that delight customers and hit the goals, but now you’ll be setting the goals.  

在高级项目部，你要承担起新的责任。以前，你被告知要做什么工作。现在，你的责任是识别新的机会，并为如何赢得这些机会制定计划。你仍然需要运送让客户满意的产品，并达到目标，但现在你要设定目标。

In this stage, a great PM comes up with winning strategies that help their product succeed in the marketplace.  

在这个阶段，优秀的项目管理人员会提出制胜策略，帮助他们的产品在市场上取得成功。

As a senior PM and PM lead, you’ll get better and better at product strategy. If you become a people manager, you might try to be the best boss for your reports.  

作为一个高级PM和PM领导，你会在产品策略方面越来越好。如果你成为一名人事经理，你可能会努力成为你的报告的最佳老板。  

But, if you’re trying to make the leap to Director (especially Senior Director), you’ll find that the job changes again.  

但是，如果你想跃升为主任（尤其是高级主任），你会发现工作内容又发生了变化。

In the third stage, your job is to build a great team.  

It’s your responsibility to hire people, coach them, and set up processes so that your organization can create winning strategies and ship winning products at a scale _beyond_ what you could do as a single PM.  

在第三阶段，你的工作是建立一个伟大的团队。你的责任是雇用人员，指导他们，并建立流程，使你的组织能够创造出成功的战略，并以超出你作为一个单一的项目管理人员所能做到的规模运送成功的产品。

And creating a strong organization below you is only half of the job. The other half is being a strategic advisor to the rest of the company. In this stage you sit in meetings with other executives.  

而在你下面创建一个强大的组织，只是工作的一半。另一半则是成为公司其他部门的战略顾问。在这个阶段，你要和其他高管坐在一起开会。  

Sometimes you represent your organization, but other times you’re just there as another smart person who cares about the company.  

有时你代表你的组织，但其他时候你只是作为另一个关心公司的聪明人在那里。  

Your relationships and credibility with other company leaders are critical.  

你与其他公司领导的关系和可信度至关重要。

In this stage, a great product leader helps their company succeed by shipping successful products at scale and being a strong strategic advisor to the company as a whole.  

在这个阶段，一个伟大的产品领导者通过大规模运送成功的产品，并成为整个公司强有力的战略顾问，来帮助他们的公司取得成功。

Product Management isn’t just one job, it’s three. As an industry we haven’t been very clear about how much things change as you advance: both the role, and what success looks like.  

产品管理不仅仅是一项工作，而是三项工作。作为一个行业，我们还不太清楚随着你的进步，事情会发生多大的变化：包括角色，以及成功的样子。

If you want to advance in your career, it’s important to know what stage you’re in, and whether your next promotion is within the stage or across them.  

如果你想在你的职业生涯中取得进步，重要的是要知道你处于哪个阶段，以及你的下一次晋升是在这个阶段内还是跨越它们。

If you’re looking to be promoted within a stage, it’s really about improving your craft. “Keep doing what you’re doing,” until you can do it faster, with fewer errors, with better results.  

如果你想在一个阶段内得到晋升，那其实就是要提高你的手艺。"继续做你正在做的事，"直到你能做得更快，错误更少，结果更好。  

Pay attention to peer feedback because it tends to accurately point at your areas of improvement.  

注意同行的反馈，因为它往往能准确地指出你需要改进的地方。

If you’re looking to be promoted to the next stage, you need to be much more intentional. Often, you’ll feel like you’re doing a _worse_ job at your current role when you start shifting to the new responsibilities. You might hand over some project management to the eng lead so that you can focus on strategy.  

You might upset one of your direct reports because you’re doing what’s right for the broader company.  

Work with your manager and manager’s peers to get the feedback that’s most important to get to the next stage.  

如果你想晋升到下一个阶段，你需要更加用心。通常情况下，当你开始转向新的职责时，你会觉得你在目前的角色上做得更糟。你可能会把一些项目管理工作移交给工程部的领导，这样你就可以专注于战略。你可能会让你的一个直接下属不高兴，因为你所做的事情对整个公司来说是正确的。与你的经理和经理的同僚合作，获得对进入下一阶段最重要的反馈。

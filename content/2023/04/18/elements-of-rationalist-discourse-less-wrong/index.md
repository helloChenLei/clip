  original_title: "Elements of Rationalist Discourse - LessWrong"
  original_lang: en
---

I liked Duncan Sabien's [Basics of Rationalist Discourse](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPv4sYrKnPzeJASuk/basics-of-rationalist-discourse-1), but it felt somewhat different from what my brain thinks of as "_the_ basics of rationalist discourse". So I decided to write down my own version (which overlaps some with Duncan's).  

我喜欢邓肯-萨比恩的《理性主义话语的基础》，但感觉与我大脑中认为的 "理性主义话语的基础 "有些不同。所以我决定写下我自己的版本（与邓肯的版本有些重合）。

Probably this new version also won't match "_the_ basics" as other people perceive them. People may not even agree that these are all good ideas!  

可能这个新版本也不符合其他人眼中的 "基本原则"。人们甚至可能不同意这些都是好的想法!  

Partly I'm posting these just out of curiosity about what the delta is between my perspective on rationalist discourse and y'alls perspectives.  

部分原因是，我发布这些只是为了好奇，我对理性主义话语的看法和你们的看法之间的差距是什么。

The basics of rationalist discourse, as I understand them:  

我所理解的理性主义话语的基本原理：

1. **Truth-Seeking.** Try to contribute to a social environment that encourages [belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re) [accuracy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X3HpE8tMXz4m4w6Rz/the-simple-truth) and good [epistemic](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv/what-do-we-mean-by-rationality-1) [processes](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs/p/HcCpvYLoSFP4iAqSz). Try not to “[win](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9f5EXt8KNNxTAihtZ/a-rational-argument)” [arguments](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/9bvAELWc8y2gYjRav/p/C8nEXTcjZb9oauTCW) using [symmetric](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/) weapons (tools that work similarly well whether you're right or wrong). Indeed, try not to treat [arguments](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3ELrPerFTSo75WnrH/p/PeSzc9JTBxhaYRp9b) like [soldiers](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yFJ7vCjefBxnTchmG/outline-of-galef-s-scout-mindset) at all.  

1.1. 寻求真理。尽量为鼓励信仰的准确性和良好的认识论过程的社会环境做出贡献。尽量不要用对称的武器（无论你是对是错，都有同样的效果的工具）来 "赢得 "争论。事实上，尽量不要把争论当作士兵。

2. **Non-Violence:** Argument gets [counter-argument](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/29/the-spirit-of-the-first-amendment/). Argument does not get bullet. Argument does not get doxxing, death threats, or coercion.<sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fn84y8cwc1yaa">[1]</a></span></span></sup>  

2.非暴力：论点得到反论点。争论不会得到子弹。争论者不会被打倒，死亡威胁，或被胁迫。 <sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fn84y8cwc1yaa">[1]</a></span></span></sup>

3. **Non-Deception.** Never try to steer your conversation partners (or onlookers) toward having falser models.  

3.不欺骗。永远不要试图引导你的谈话伙伴（或旁观者）拥有更虚假的模型。  

Where possible, avoid saying stuff that you expect to lower the net belief accuracy of the average reader; or failing that, at least flag that you're worried about this happening.  

在可能的情况下，避免说一些你认为会降低普通读者的净信念准确度的东西；或者如果做不到这一点，至少要标明你担心会发生这种情况。

As a corollary:  

作为一个推论：

3.1. [**Meta-Honesty**](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xdwbX9pFEr7Pomaxv/meta-honesty-firming-up-honesty-around-its-edge-cases)**.** Make it easy for others to tell how honest, literal, PR-y, etc. you are (in general, or in particular contexts).  

3.1.元诚实。让别人很容易看出你有多诚实、多直白、多公关等等（在一般情况下，或在特殊情况下）。  

This can include everything from "prominently publicly discussing the sorts of situations in which you'd lie" to "tweaking your image/persona/tone/etc.  

这可以包括一切，从 "突出地公开讨论你会撒谎的各种情况 "到 "调整你的形象/人物/语气/等等。  

to make it likelier that people will have the right [priors](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/priors) about your honesty".  

以使人们更有可能对你的诚实有正确的预判"。

4. **Localizability.** Give people a social affordance to [decouple](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms) / evaluate the [local](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WQFioaudEH8R7fyhm/local-validity-as-a-key-to-sanity-and-civilization) validity of claims. Decoupling is not _required_, and indeed context is often important and extremely worth talking about! But it should almost always be _OK_ to locally address a specific point or subpoint, without necessarily weighing in on the larger context or suggesting you’ll engage further.  

4.4. 本地化。给人们一个社会负担，以解耦/评估主张的本地有效性。脱钩并不是必须的，事实上，背景往往是很重要的，也是非常值得讨论的！但几乎总是可以在本地解决一个特定的点或子点，而不一定要在更大的范围内权衡！但是，在当地解决一个特定的点或子点几乎总是可以的，而不一定要对更大的背景进行权衡，或者建议你进一步参与。

5\. **Alternative-Minding.** Consider [alternative](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/FrqfoG3LJeCZs96Ym/p/erGipespbbzdG5zYb) hypotheses, and ask yourself what [Bayesian](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oFePMp9rKftEeZDDr/p/QkX2bAkwG2EpGvNug) [evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK) you have that you're not in those alternative worlds. This mostly involves asking what models [retrodict](https://twitter.com/robbensinger/status/1524473598118834176).  

5.5.替代性思维。考虑替代假说，并问自己有什么贝叶斯证据证明你不在这些替代世界中。这主要涉及到问什么模型可以逆转。

Cultivate the skills of original [seeing](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pmHZDpak4NeRLLLCw) and of seeing from new vantage points.  

培养原创性观察和从新的有利位置观察的技能。

As a special case, try to understand and evaluate the alternative hypotheses that other people are advocating. Paraphrase stuff back to people to see if you [understood](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/sSqoEw9eRP2kPKLCz), and see if they think you pass their [Ideological Turing Test](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html) on the relevant ideas.  

作为一个特例，试着去理解和评估其他人所主张的其他假设。把东西转述给别人，看你是否理解，看他们是否认为你通过了他们对相关思想的图灵测试。

Be a fair bit more willing to consider nonstandard beliefs, frames/lenses, and methodologies, compared to (e.g.) the average academic. Keep in mind that inferential gaps can be [large](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK/p/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w), most life-experience is hard to transmit in a [small](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AJ9dX59QXokZb35fk/when-not-to-use-probabilities) number of [words](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4gDbqL3Tods8kHDqs/limits-to-legibility) (or in words at all), and converging on the truth can require a long process of cultivating the right mental motions, doing exercises, gathering and interpreting new data, etc.  

与（例如）普通学者相比，更愿意考虑非标准的信仰、框架/镜头和方法论。请记住，推论的差距可能很大，大多数生活经验很难用少量的文字（或根本无法用文字）来表达，而汇聚到真理上可能需要一个漫长的过程，即培养正确的心理动作，做练习，收集和解释新的数据，等等。

Make it a habit to explicitly distinguish "what this person literally said" from "what I think this person means".  

养成习惯，明确区分 "这个人的字面意思 "和 "我认为这个人的意思"。  

Make it a habit to explicitly distinguish "what I think this person means" from "what I infer about this person as a result".  

养成习惯，明确区分 "我认为这个人的意思 "和 "我因此而推断这个人的意思"。

6. **Reality-Minding.** Keep your eye on the ball, [hug](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2jp98zdLo898qExrr/hug-the-query) the query, and don’t lose sight of [object-level](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Js34Ez9nrDeJCTYQL/politics-is-way-too-meta) [reality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dhj9dhiwhq3DX6W8z/hero-licensing).  

6.6.关注现实。盯着球，抱着疑问，不要忽略了对象层面的现实。

Make it a habit to flag when you notice ways to test an assertion. Make it a habit to actually test claims, when the [value-of-information](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/value-of-information) is high enough.  

当你注意到可以测试一个断言的方法时，要养成标记的习惯。当信息价值足够高时，要养成实际测试主张的习惯。

Reward scholarship, inquiry, [betting](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/a-bet-is-a-tax-on-bullshit.html), pre-registered predictions, and sticking your neck out, especially where this is time-consuming, effortful, or socially risky.  

奖励学术研究、探究、投注、预先登记的预测和坚持不懈的努力，特别是在这一过程耗时、费力或有社会风险的地方。

7. **Reducibility.** Err on the side of using simple, [concrete](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lz64L3yJEtYGkzMzu/rationality-and-the-english-language), literal, and [precise](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yDfxTj9TKYsYiWH5o/the-virtue-of-narrowness) language. Make it a habit to [taboo](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words) your words, do [reductionism](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/p3TndjYbdYaiWwm9x), explain what you mean, [define](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/895quRDaK6gR2rM82/diseased-thinking-dissolving-questions-about-disease) your [terms](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb), etc.  

7.7. 减少。倾向于使用简单、具体、字面和精确的语言。要养成习惯，忌讳你的文字，做还原主义，解释你的意思，定义你的术语，等等。

As a corollary, applying precision and naturalism your own cognition:  

作为一个推论，应用精确和自然主义你自己的认知：

7.1. **Probabilism.** Try to [quantify](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/zpCiuR4T343j9WkcK) your [uncertainty](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/FrqfoG3LJeCZs96Ym) to some degree.  

7.1.概率论。尝试在一定程度上量化你的不确定性。

8. **Purpose-Minding.** Try not to lose [purpose](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sP2Hg6uPwpfp3jZJN/lost-purposes) (unless you're deliberately creating a sandbox for a more free-form and undirected stream of consciousness, based on some meta-purpose or impulse or hunch you want to follow).  

8.8.目的性引导。尽量不要失去目的（除非你刻意为更自由的、不受指导的意识流创造一个沙盒，基于一些元目的或冲动或你想遵循的预感）。

Ask yourself why you're having a conversation, and whether you want to do something [differently](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZHWiCM4QmX8WwYajH/goal-factoring-1). Ask others what their goals are. Keep the [Void](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality) in view.  

问问自己为什么要进行对话，以及你是否想做一些不同的事情。问问别人的目标是什么。保持对 "虚空 "的关注。

As a corollary:  

作为一个推论：

8.1. **Cruxiness.** Insofar as you have a sense of what the topic/goal of the conversation is, focus on [cruxes](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux), or (if your goal shifts) consider explicitly flagging that you're tangenting or switching to a new conversational topic/goal.<sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fn1f6sfa3ew9v">[2]</a></span></span></sup>  

8.1.关键性。只要你知道谈话的主题/目标是什么，就把重点放在关键点上，或者（如果你的目标发生了变化）考虑明确地标明你正在切入或转到一个新的谈话主题/目标。 <sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fn1f6sfa3ew9v">[2]</a></span></span></sup>

9. **Goodwill.** Reward others' good epistemic conduct (e.g., updating) more than most people naturally do.  

9.9.善意。奖励他人良好的认识论行为（如更新），比大多数人自然的做法更多。  

Err on the side of carrots over sticks, forgiveness over punishment, and civility over incivility, unless someone has explicitly set aside a weirder or more rough-and-tumble space.<sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fnmyb62zkh2d">[3]</a></span></span></sup>  

除非有人明确规定了一个更奇怪或更粗暴的空间，否则要站在胡萝卜而不是大棒，宽恕而不是惩罚，文明而不是不文明的一边。 <sup><span><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fnmyb62zkh2d">[3]</a></span></span></sup>

10. **Experience-Owning.** Err on the side of explicitly [owning](https://medium.com/authenticrelating/owning-your-experience-21104b4a62b6) your experiences, mental states, beliefs, and impressions. Flag your inferences as inferences, and beware the [Mind Projection Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy) and [Typical Mind Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/baTWMegR42PAsH9qJ/generalizing-from-one-example).  

10.经验所有权。在明确拥有你的经验、心理状态、信仰和印象方面，要做得更好。将你的推论标记为推论，并谨防心灵投射谬误和典型心灵谬误。

As a corollary:  

作为一个推论：

10.1. **Valence-Owning.** Err on the side of explicitly owning your [shoulds](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zqwWicCLNBSA5Ssmn/by-which-it-may-be-judged) and [desires](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/9bvAELWc8y2gYjRav). Err on the side of stating your wants and beliefs (and why you want or believe them) instead of (or in addition to) saying what you think people [ought](https://mindingourway.com/guilt/) to do.  

10.1.价值拥有。在明确地拥有你的应该和愿望的一面。在陈述你的愿望和信念（以及你为什么想要或相信它们），而不是（或除此之外）说你认为人们应该做什么。

Try to phrase things in ways that make space for disagreement, and try to avoid socially pressuring people into doing things.  

尽量用为不同意见留出空间的方式来表述事情，并尽量避免在社会上对人们施加压力，迫使他们做事。  

Instead, as a strong default, approach people with an attitude of informing and [empowering](https://www.tumblr.com/theunitofcaring/177842591031/what-are-your-favorite-virtues) them to do what _they_ want.  

相反，作为一种强烈的默认，以告知和授权的态度接近人们，让他们做他们想做的事。

Favor language with fewer and milder connotations, and make your arguments explicitly where possible, rather than relying excessively on the connotations, feel, [fnords](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/24/nydwracus-fnords/), or vibes of your words.  

倾向于使用内涵较少和较温和的语言，并在可能的情况下明确提出你的论点，而不是过度依赖你话语的内涵、感觉、风骨或氛围。

A longer, less jargony version of this post is available [on the EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JnijsXwYDCJDwRcuc/elements-of-rationalist-discourse).  

这篇文章的较长、较少的行话版本可在EA论坛上找到。

1.  <sup><strong><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fnref84y8cwc1yaa">^</a></span></strong></sup>
    
    Counter-arguments aren't the _only_ OK response to an argument. You can choose not to reply. You can even ban someone because they keep making off-topic arguments, as long as you do this in a non-deceptive way.  
    
    反驳并不是对一个论点唯一可以的回应。你可以选择不回答。你甚至可以禁止某人，因为他们一直在进行离题的争论，只要你以非欺骗性的方式进行。  
    
    But some responses to arguments are explicitly off the table.  
    
    但有些对争论的回应是明确的，不在桌面上。
    
2.  <sup><strong><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fnref1f6sfa3ew9v">^</a></span></strong></sup>
    
    Note that "the topic/goal of the conversation" is an abstraction. "Goals" don't exist in a vacuum. _You_ have goals (though these may not be perfectly stable, coherent, etc.), and other individuals have goals too.  
    
    请注意，"谈话的主题/目标 "是一个抽象的概念。"目标 "并不存在于真空中。你有目标（尽管这些目标可能不是完全稳定、连贯的，等等），其他个人也有目标。  
    
    Conversations can be mutually beneficial when some of my goals are the same as some of yours, or when we have disjoint goals but some actions are useful for my goals as well as yours.  
    
    当我的一些目标与你的一些目标相同时，或者当我们的目标不一致，但一些行动对我的目标和你的目标都有用时，对话可以是互利的。
    
    Be wary of abstractions and unargued premises in this very list! Try to [taboo](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words) these prescriptions and claims, paraphrase them back, figure out why I might be saying all this stuff, and explicitly ask yourself whether these norms serve your goals too.  
    
    在这个清单中要警惕抽象的东西和未经论证的前提!试着禁忌这些处方和主张，把它们解析回来，想一想为什么我可能会说这些东西，并明确地问自己这些规范是否也为你的目标服务。
    
    Part of why I've phrased this list as a bunch of noun phrases ("purpose-minding", etc.) rather than verb phrases ("mind your purpose", etc.) is that I suspect conversations will go better (on the dimension of goodwill and cheer) if people make a habit of saying "hm, I think you violated the principle of experience-owning there" or "hm, your comment isn't doing the experience-owning thing as much as I'd have liked", as opposed to "own your experience!!".  
    
    我之所以把这个清单写成一堆名词短语（"目的--引导"，等等），而不是动词短语（"注意你的目的"，等等），部分原因是我怀疑如果人们养成说 "嗯，我认为你在那里违反了拥有经验的原则 "或 "嗯，你的评论没有像我希望的那样做拥有经验的事情 "的习惯，而不是 "拥有你的经验！！"，对话会更顺利（在善意和欢呼方面）。
    
    But another part of why I used nouns is that commands aren't experience-owning, and can make it harder for people to mind their purposes. I _do_ have imperatives in the post (mostly because the prose flowed better that way), but I want to encourage people to engage with the ideas and consider whether they make sense, rather than just blindly obey them.  
    
    但我使用名词的另一部分原因是，命令并不属于经验，而且会使人们更难注意到其目的。我在文章中确实有命令式的内容（主要是因为这样的散文更流畅），但我想鼓励人们参与到这些想法中，考虑它们是否有意义，而不是盲目地服从它们。  
    
    So I want people to come into this post engaging with these first as ideas to consider, rather than as commands to obey.  
    
    因此，我希望人们在阅读这篇帖子时，首先把这些作为考虑的想法，而不是作为要服从的命令。
    
3.  <sup><strong><span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse#fnrefmyb62zkh2d">^</a></span></strong></sup>
    
    Note that this doesn't require assuming everyone you talk to is honest or has good intentions.  
    
    请注意，这并不要求假设与你交谈的每个人都是诚实的或有好的意图。
    
    It _does_ have some overlap with the rule of thumb "as a very strong but defeasible default, carry on object-level discourse as if you were role-playing being on the [same side](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MdZyLnLHuaHrCskjy/itt-passing-and-civility-are-good-charity-is-bad?commentId=Ez9h3EGmmiGt3j9f7#comments) as the people who disagree with you".  
    
    它确实与经验法则有一些重叠，"作为一个非常强大但可击败的默认值，进行对象层面的讨论，就像你在角色扮演，与不同意你的人站在同一阵线"。

I'd want to include some kinds of social responses as unacceptable as well. Derision, mockery, acts to make the argument low status, ad hominems, etc.   

我想把一些种类的社会反应也列为不可接受的。揶揄、嘲弄、使争论者地位低下的行为、攻击性的话语等等。

You can choose not to engage with bad arguments, but you shouldn't engage by not addressing the arguments and instead trying to execute some social maneuver to discredit it.   

你可以选择不参与不好的论点，但你不应该通过不解决论点，而是试图执行一些社会手法来诋毁它。

I would expand "acts to make the argument low status" to "acts to make the argument low status _without addressing the argument_". Lots of good rationalist material, including the original Sequences, includes a fair amount of "acts to make arguments low status".  

我想把 "使论点地位低下的行为 "扩大为 "使论点地位低下而不涉及论点的行为"。很多好的理性主义材料，包括最初的《序列》，都包括相当多的 "使论点地位降低的行为"。  

This is fine—good, even—because it treats the arguments it targets in good faith and has a message that rhymes with "this argument is embarrassing because it is clearly wrong, as I have shown in section 2 above" rather than "this argument is embarrassing because gross stupid creeps believe it".  

这很好--甚至很好--因为它真诚地对待它所针对的论点，并有一个押韵的信息："这个论点令人尴尬，因为它显然是错误的，正如我在上面第2节所表明的那样"，而不是 "这个论点令人尴尬，因为毛茸茸的蠢货相信它"。

Many arguments are actually very bad. It's reasonable and fair to have a lower opinion of people who hold them, and to convey that opinion to others along with the justification.  

许多论点实际上是非常糟糕的。对持有这些论点的人有一个较低的评价，并将这种评价与理由一起传达给其他人，这是合理和公平的。  

As you say, "you shouldn't engage by not addressing the arguments and instead trying to execute some social maneuver to discredit it".  

正如你所说，"你不应该通过不解决论点，而是试图执行一些社会手法来诋毁它来参与"。  

Discrediting arguments by social maneuvers that rely on actual engagement with the argument's contents is compatible with this.  

通过依靠实际参与论证内容的社会手法来诋毁论证，与此是一致的。

> Derision, mockery, acts to make the argument low status, ad hominems, etc.  
> 
> 揶揄、嘲讽、使论点地位低下的行为、攻击性的言辞等等。

I don't want to include these in "Non-Violence", because I'm thinking of that rule as relatively absolute.  

我不想把这些列入 "非暴力"，因为我认为这个规则是相对绝对的。  

By comparison, "derision" and "mockery" should probably be kept to a minimum, but I'm not going to pretend I've never made fun of the Time Cube guy, or that I feel super bad about having done so.  

相比之下，"揶揄 "和 "嘲弄 "也许应该保持在最低限度，但我不会假装我从来没有取笑过时间立方体的家伙，也不会假装我对曾经这样做感到超级糟糕。

I also think sometimes a person tries to output "light-hearted playing around", but someone else perceives it as "cruel mockery".  

我还认为，有时一个人试图输出 "轻松的打闹"，但别人却认为这是 "残酷的嘲弄"。  

This can be a hint that the speaker messed up a bit, but I don't want to treat it as a serious sin (and I don't want to ban all play for the sake of preventing this).  

这可能是一个暗示，说明说话者有点乱，但我不想把它当作严重的罪过（我也不想为了防止这种情况而禁止所有的游戏）。

Similarly, "acts to make the argument low status" is a bit tricky to encode as a rule, because even things as simple as "generating a good counter-argument" can lower the original argument's status in many people's eyes.  

同样，"使论证地位低下的行为 "作为一条规则来编码有点棘手，因为即使是像 "产生一个好的反论证 "这样简单的事情也会降低原论证在许多人眼中的地位。  

(Flawed arguments _should_ plausibly be seen as lower-status than good arguments!)  

(有缺陷的论证应该被视为比好的论证地位更低！)

And "ad hominem" can actually be justified when the topic is someone's character (e.g., when you're discussing a presidential candidate's judgment, or discussing whether to hire someone, or discussing whether someone's safe to date).  

而当话题是某人的性格时，"ad hominem "实际上是有道理的（例如，当你讨论一个总统候选人的判断力，或讨论是否雇用某人，或讨论某人是否可以安全地约会）。  

So again it's tricky to delimit exactly which cases are OK versus bad.  

因此，要准确地界定哪些情况是好的，哪些是坏的，又是很棘手的。

I've made fun of people on Twitter, but:  

我曾在Twitter上取笑过别人，但是：

1.  Don't think that reflects well on me as a rationalist  
    
    我不认为这反映了我作为一个理性主义者的良好形象。
2.  Don't think such posts are acceptable content for LessWrong.  
    
    不认为这样的帖子是LessWrong可以接受的内容。

You may not feel bad about mockery (I don't generally do so either), but do you think it reflects well on you as a rationalist?  

你可能不觉得嘲笑有什么不好（我一般也不觉得），但你认为这对你作为一个理性主义者有什么影响吗？

> I don't want to include these in "Non-Violence", because I'm thinking of that rule as relatively absolute.  
> 
> 我不想把这些列入 "非暴力"，因为我认为这个规则是相对绝对的。

I agree these aren't acts of violence, but I listened to the rest of the post and didn't hear you object to them anywhere else.  

我同意这些不是暴力行为，但我听了帖子的其他部分，没有听到你在其他地方反对它们。  

This felt like the closest place (in that bad argument gets counterargument and doesn't get any of the things I mentioned).  

这感觉是最接近的地方（在坏的论点得到反驳，没有得到我提到的任何东西）。

An appropriately more nuanced version would be something like: "acts to make an argument low status for reasons other than its accuracy/veracity, and conformance to norms (some true things can be presented in very unpleasant/distasteful ways \[e.g.  

一个适当的更细微的版本应该是这样的："使一个论点地位低下的行为，原因不在于它的准确性/真实性，也不在于它是否符合规范（一些真实的东西可以用非常令人不快/不愉快的方式呈现\[例如。  

with the deliberate goal of being maximally offensive\])".  

故意以最大限度的攻击性为目标\]"。

> You may not feel bas about mockery (I don't generally do so either), but do you think it reflects well on you as a rationalist?

> 你可能对嘲讽不感到巴斯（我一般也不这样做），但你认为这对你作为一个理性主义者有什么影响吗？

I like this example! I do indeed share the intuition "mocking Time Cube guy on Twitter doesn't reflect well on me as a rationalist". It also just seems mean to me.  

我喜欢这个例子!我确实有这样的直觉："在推特上嘲笑时间立方体的人并不能反映我作为一个理性主义者的良好形象"。对我来说，这也只是看起来很卑鄙。

I think part of what's driving my intuition here, though, is that "mocking" sounds inherently mean-spirited, and "on Twitter" makes it sound like I'm writing the sort of low-quality viral personal attack that's common on Twitter.  

不过，我想驱动我的直觉的部分原因是，"嘲笑 "听起来本质上是刻薄的，而 "在Twitter上 "使它听起来像我在写Twitter上常见的那种低质量的病毒式人身攻击。

"Make a light-hearted reference to Time Cube (in a way that takes for granted that Time Cube is silly) in a chat with some friends" feels pretty unlike "write a tweet mocking and deriding Time Cube", and the former doesn't feel to me like it necessarily reflects poorly on me as a rationalist.  

"在与一些朋友的聊天中轻松地提到《时间立方》（以一种理所当然地认为《时间立方》很傻的方式）"感觉与 "写一条嘲讽和嘲笑《时间立方》的推特 "很不一样，而且我觉得前者并不一定能反映出我作为一个理性主义者的劣势。  

(It feels more orthogonal to the spirit of rationality to me, like making puns or playing a video game; puns are neither rationalist nor anti-rationalist.)  

(在我看来，它更多地是与理性的精神正交，就像制造双关语或玩电子游戏一样；双关语既不是理性主义，也不是反理性主义)。

So part of my reservation here is that I have pretty different intuitions about different versions of "tell jokes that turn on a certain claim/belief being low-probability", and I'm not sure where to draw the line exactly (beyond the general heuristics I mentioned in the OP).  

因此，我在这里的部分保留意见是，我对不同版本的 "讲笑话是基于某种主张/信仰的低概率 "有相当不同的直觉，而且我不确定到底该在哪里划线（除了我在OP中提到的一般启发式方法）。

Another part of my reservation is just that I'm erring on the side of keeping the list of norms too short rather than too long.  

我的另一部分保留意见只是，我在保持规范清单太短而不是太长方面犯了错误。  

I'd rather have non-exhaustive lists and encourage people to use their common sense and personal conscience as a guide in the many cases that the guidelines don't cover (or don't cover until you do some interpretive work).  

我宁愿有非详尽的清单，并鼓励人们在准则没有涵盖（或在你做一些解释工作之前没有涵盖）的许多情况下，用他们的常识和个人良知作为指导。

I worry that modern society is too norm-heavy in general, encouraging people to fixate on heuristics, patches, and local Prohibited Actions, in ways that are cognitively taxing and unduly 'domesticating'.  

我担心现代社会的规范太多，鼓励人们固定在启发式方法、补丁和局部禁止的行为上，这对人们的认知是一种负担，而且是不适当的 "驯化"。  

I think this can make it harder to notice and appropriately respond to the specifics of the situation you're in, because your brain is yelling a memorized "no!  

我认为这可能会使你更难注意到并适当地应对你所处的具体状况，因为你的大脑正在大喊一个记忆中的 "不！"！  

unconditional rule X!" script at you, when in fact if you consulted your unassisted conscience and your common sense you'd have an easier time seeing what the right thing to do is.  

如果你能咨询一下你的良心和常识，你会更容易看到什么是正确的事情。

So I'm mostly interested in trying to distill core aspects of the _spirit_ of rationalist discourse, in the hope that this can help people's common sense and conscience grow (/ help people become more self-aware of aspects of their common sense and conscience that are already inside themselves, but that they aren't lucid about).  

因此，我主要对试图提炼出理性主义话语精神的核心内容感兴趣，希望这能帮助人们的常识和良知的成长（/帮助人们更加自我意识到他们的常识和良知中已经存在的、但他们并不清醒的方面）。

I suspect I've left at least one important part of "the spirit of rationalist discourse" out, so I'm mainly nitpicking your suggestions in case your replies cause me to realize that I'm missing some important underlying generator that isn't alluded to in the OP.  

我怀疑我至少遗漏了 "理性主义话语精神 "的一个重要部分，所以我主要是对你们的建议吹毛求疵，以防你们的答复使我意识到我遗漏了一些重要的基本发生器，而这些发生器在OP中并没有影射到。  

I care less about whether "mockery" specifically gets called out in the OP, and more about whether I've neglected an underlying spirit/generator.  

我不太关心 "嘲讽 "是否被具体地叫出来，而更关心我是否忽略了一个潜在的精神/生成器。

Maybe Goodwill is missing a generator-sentence that's something like "**Don't lean into cruelty, or otherwise lose sight of what your conscience or common sense says about how best to relate to other human beings.**"  

也许Goodwill缺少一个发生器句子，即 "不要倾向于残忍，或以其他方式忽视你的良知或常识中关于如何最好地与其他人类相处的内容。"

> "acts to make an argument low status for reasons other than its accuracy/veracity, and conformance to norms (some true things can be presented in very unpleasant/distasteful ways \[e.g.

Yeah, I like that more. I still worry that "low status" is vague and different people conceive of it differently, so I have the instinct that it might be good to taboo "status" here.  

是的，我更喜欢这样。我仍然担心 "地位低下 "是模糊的，不同的人对它有不同的概念，所以我有一种直觉，在这里禁忌 "地位 "可能是好事。  

"Conformance to norms" is also _super_ vague; someone would need to have the right norms in mind in order for this to work.  

"符合规范 "也是超级模糊的；有人需要在心中有正确的规范，才能使之发挥作用。

I also don't want to call minor things like ad hominems "violent"!  

我也不想把一些小事，比如广告词，称为 "暴力"！我的意思是说，如果你是一个人，那么你就应该去做！

(Actually, possibly I'm already watering down "violence" more than is ideal by treating "doxxing" and "coercion" as violent.  

(实际上，我把 "打劫 "和 "胁迫 "视为暴力，已经把 "暴力 "淡化得不够理想了。  

But in this context I do feel like physical violence, death threats, doxing, and coercion are in a cluster together, whatever you want to call it, and things like mockery are in a different cluster.)  

但在这种情况下，我确实觉得身体暴力、死亡威胁、挖墙脚和胁迫是在一起的，不管你怎么称呼它，而像嘲讽这样的事情是在另一个集群中)。

It seems to me that forms of mockery, bullying, social ostracization etc are actually in the same cluster. They all attack the opponent with something else than an argument, be it physical or not.  

在我看来，嘲讽、欺凌、社会排斥等形式实际上是同一组的。它们都是用争论以外的东西来攻击对手，无论是否是身体上的。  

If bullying doesn't count as violence, then the problem seems to be with labeling the cluster "violence".  

如果欺凌不算是暴力，那么问题似乎出在给这个集群贴上 "暴力 "的标签上。  

Maybe rule 2 shouldn't be called "non-violence", but "non-aggressiveness" or something like that.  

也许规则2不应该被称为 "非暴力"，而是 "非攻击性 "或类似的东西。

> They all attack the opponent with something else than an argument, be it physical or not.  
> 
> 他们都是以争论以外的东西来攻击对手，不管是身体上的还是精神上的。

And what, precisely, is an "attack"? Can you taboo that word and give a pretty precise definition, so we know what does and doesn't count?  

那么，准确地说，什么是 "攻击"？你能禁忌这个词，并给出一个相当精确的定义，这样我们就能知道什么算，什么不算？

I've seen people on the Internet use words like "bullying", "harassment", "violence", "abuse", etc. to refer to stuff like 'disagreeing with my political opinions'.  

我看到互联网上的人用 "欺凌"、"骚扰"、"暴力"、"虐待 "等词来指代 "不同意我的政治观点 "这样的东西。

(The logic being, e.g.: "Anti-Semites have historically killed people like me. I claim that political opinion X (e.g., about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) is anti-Semitic.  

(其逻辑是，例如："反犹太主义者在历史上曾杀害过像我这样的人。我声称，政治观点X（例如，关于以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突）是反犹太主义的。  

Therefore you expressing your opinion is (1) a thing I should reasonably take as a veiled threat against me and an attempt to bully and harass me, and (2) a thing that will embolden anti-Semites and thereby further endanger me.")  

因此，你表达你的意见是：（1）我应该合理地认为是对我的隐蔽威胁，并试图欺负和骚扰我；（2）是会让反犹太主义分子胆战心惊，从而进一步危害我。"）。

I'm not saying that this reasoning makes sense, or that we should totally avoid words like "bullying" because they get overused in a lot of places.  

我不是说这个推理有意义，也不是说我们应该完全避免像 "欺凌 "这样的词，因为它们在很多地方被过度使用。  

But I do take stuff like this as a warning sign about what can happen if you start building your social norms around vague concepts.  

但我确实把这样的东西作为一个警告信号，说明如果你开始围绕模糊的概念建立你的社会规范会发生什么。

I'd rather have norms that either mention extremely specific concrete things that aren't up for interpretation (see how much more concrete "death threats" is than "bullying"), or that mention higher-level features shared by lots of different bad behavior (e.g., "avoid symmetric weapons").  

我宁愿有这样的规范：要么提到极其具体的、不需要解释的事情（看看 "死亡威胁 "比 "欺凌 "具体得多），要么提到许多不同的不良行为所共有的更高层次的特征（例如，"避免对称性武器"）。

> And what, precisely, is an "attack"? Can you taboo that word and give a pretty precise definition, so we know what does and doesn't count?

> 那么，准确地说，什么是 "攻击"？你能禁忌这个词，并给出一个相当精确的定义，这样我们就能知道什么算，什么不算？

How about "hurting a person or deminishing their credibility, or the credibility of their argument, without using a rational argument"?  

那么，"在不使用理性论证的情况下，伤害一个人或贬低其可信度，或其论证的可信度 "如何？  

This would make it acceptable when people get hurt by rational arguments, or when their credibility is diminished by such an argument.  

这样一来，当人们被理性的争论所伤害，或者他们的信誉被这种争论所削弱时，就可以接受。  

The problem seems to be when this is achieved by something else than a rational argument.  

问题似乎在于，当这是通过理性论证以外的东西来实现的时候。

Maybe this is not the perfect definition of the cluster which includes both physical violence and non-physical aggression, but the pure "physical violence" cluster seems in any case arbitrary. E.g.  

也许这不是一个完美的定义，这个群组包括身体暴力和非身体攻击，但纯粹的 "身体暴力 "群组在任何情况下都显得很随意。例如  

social ostracization can be far more damaging than a punch in the guts, and both are bad as a response to an argument insofar they are not themselves forms of argument.  

社会排斥的危害性远大于一拳打在肠子上，只要它们本身不是争论的形式，作为对争论的回应，两者都是不好的。

> I've seen people on the Internet use words like "bullying", "harassment", "violence", "abuse", etc. to refer to stuff like 'disagreeing with my political opinions'.

Yes, people do that, but them confusing disagreement with bullying doesn't mean disagreement is bullying. And the fact that disagreement is okay doesn't mean that bullying, mockery, etc.  

是的，人们会这样做，但他们把不同意见与欺凌混为一谈并不意味着不同意见就是欺凌。而且，不同意是可以的，并不意味着欺凌、嘲弄等。  

is a valid discourse strategy.  

是一种有效的话语策略。

Moreover, the speaker can identify actions like mockery by introspection, so avoiding it doesn't rely on the capabilities of the listener to distinguish it from disagreement.  

此外，说话者可以通过内省来识别像嘲弄这样的行为，所以避免嘲弄并不依赖听众的能力来区分它和分歧。  

The vagueness objection seems to assume the perspective of the listener, but rule 2 applies to us in our role as speakers. It recommends what we should say or do, not how we should interpret others.  

模糊性的反对意见似乎假定了听众的观点，但规则2适用于我们作为演讲者的角色。它建议我们应该说什么或做什么，而不是我们应该如何解释别人。  

(Of course, there could be an additional rule which says that we, as listeners, shouldn't be quick to dismiss mere disagreements as personal attacks.)  

(当然，还可以有一个额外的规则，说我们作为听众，不应该迅速将单纯的分歧视为人身攻击。）

> 
> 那么，"在不使用理性论证的情况下，伤害一个人或贬低其可信度，或其论证的可信度 "如何？

"Hurting a person" still seems too vague to me (sometimes people are "hurt" just because you disagreed with them on a claim of fact), "Diminishing... the credibility of their argument, without using a rational argument" sounds similar to "using symmetric weapons" to me (but the latter strikes me as more precise and general: don't try to persuade people via tools that aren't Bayesian evidence for the truth of the thing you're trying to persuade them of).  

"伤害一个人 "在我看来还是太模糊了（有时人们被 "伤害 "只是因为你在事实的主张上与他们有分歧），"减少......他们的论证的可信度，而不使用合理的论证 "在我看来类似于 "使用对称的武器"（但后者让我觉得更精确和笼统：不要试图通过不是贝叶斯证据的工具来说服人们相信你试图说服他们的事情的真相）。

"A rational argument", I worry, is too vague here, and will make people think that all rationalist conversation as to look like their mental picture of Spock-style discourse.  

我担心，"理性的论证 "在这里太模糊了，会让人们认为所有理性主义的对话都要像他们心目中的斯波克式的话语。

> The problem seems to be when this is achieved by something else than a rational argument.  
> 
> 问题似乎在于，当这是通过理性论证以外的东西来实现的时候。

A lot of things can hurt people's feelings other than rational arguments, and I don't think the person causing the hurt is always at fault for those things.  

除了理性的争论之外，很多事情都会伤害人们的感情，我不认为造成伤害的人总是对这些事情有错。  

(E.g., maybe I beat someone at a video game and this upset them.)  

(例如，也许我在视频游戏中击败了某人，这让他们很不高兴）。

The point of separating out physical violence isn't to say "this is the worst thing you can do to someone".  

将身体暴力分离出来的意义并不是说 "这是你能对某人做的最糟糕的事情"。  

It's to draw a clear black line around a case that's especially easy to rule completely out of bounds.  

这是为了给一个特别容易被裁定为完全不符合规定的案件画上一条清晰的黑线。  

We've made at least some progress thereby, and it would be a mistake to throw out this progress just because it doesn't solve every _other_ problem; don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  

我们至少由此取得了一些进展，如果仅仅因为它没有解决其他所有问题而丢弃这些进展，那将是一个错误；不要让完美成为美好的敌人。

Other sorts of actions can be worse than some forms of physical violence consequentially, but there isn't a good sharp black line in every case for clearly verbally transmitting what those out-of-bound actions are.  

其他种类的行为可能比某些形式的身体暴力更糟糕，但并不是在每一种情况下都有一条很好的尖锐的黑线，可以清楚地用语言表达出那些不受约束的行为是什么。

另见我对龙神的答复。

Even "this is at least as harmful as a punch in the gut" isn't a good pointer, since some people are extremely emotionally brittle and can be put in severe pain with very minor social slights.  

即使是 "这至少和在肠子里打一拳一样有害 "也不是一个好的指针，因为有些人的情感极其脆弱，可以因为非常小的社会轻视而陷入严重的痛苦。  

I think it's virtuous to try to help those people flourish, but I don't want to claim that a rationalist has done a Terrible Thing if they ever do something that makes someone that upset; it depends on the situation.  

我认为努力帮助这些人茁壮成长是美德，但我不想宣称一个理性主义者做了一件可怕的事情，如果他们曾经做了一些让人如此不安的事情；这取决于情况。

I feel specifically uncomfortable with leaning on the phrase "social ostracization" here, because it's so vague, and the way you're talking about it makes it sound like you want rationalists to be individually responsible for making every human on Earth feel happy, welcome, and accepted in the rat community.  

我对在这里倚重 "社会排斥 "这个短语感到特别不舒服，因为它太模糊了，而且你谈论它的方式让人觉得你想让理性主义者单独负责让地球上的每一个人在老鼠社区感到快乐、欢迎和接受。  

"Ostracization" seems clearly bad to me if it looks like bullying and harassment, but sometimes "ostracizing" just means banning someone from an Internet forum, and I think banning is often prosocial.  

"排斥 "在我看来显然是不好的，如果它看起来像欺凌和骚扰，但有时 "排斥 "只是意味着在互联网论坛上禁止某人，而我认为禁止往往是亲社会的。

(Including banning someone because of an argument! If someone keeps posting off-topic arguments, feel free to ban.)  

(包括因为争论而禁止某人!如果有人一直发布离题的争论，请随时禁言）。

As I said, if someone feels upset by mere disagreement, that's not a violation of a rational discourse norm.  

正如我所说，如果有人仅仅因为不同意见而感到不安，这并不违反理性的话语规范。

The focus on physical violence is nice insofar violence is halfway clear-cut, but is also fairly useless insofar the badness of violence is obvious to most people (unlike things like bullying, bad-faith mockery, moral grandstanding, etc which are very common), and mostly irrelevant in internet discussions without physical contact, where most irrational discourse is happening nowadays, very nonviolently.  

就暴力的半途而废而言，对身体暴力的关注是不错的，但也是相当无用的，因为暴力的坏处对大多数人来说是显而易见的（不像欺凌、恶意嘲讽、道德上的哗众取宠等是非常常见的），而且在没有身体接触的网络讨论中大多是不相关的，现在大多数非理性的言论都是以非常非暴力的方式发生的。

> I feel specifically uncomfortable with leaning on the phrase "social ostracization" here, because it's so vague, and the way you're talking about it makes it sound like you want rationalists to be individually responsible for making every human on Earth feel happy, welcome, and accepted in the rat community.  
>

That seems to me an uncharitable interpretation. Social ostracization is prototypically something which happens e.g. when someone gets cancelled by a Twitter mob.  

在我看来，这是不公平的解释。社会排斥是典型的事情，例如，当某人被推特上的暴民取消资格时。  

"Mob" insofar those people don't use rational arguments to attack you, even if "attacking you without using arguments" can't be defined perfectly precisely.  

"暴民"，只要那些人不使用理性的论据来攻击你，即使 "不使用论据来攻击你 "不能被完全精确地定义。  

(Something like the Bostrom witch-hunt on Twitter, which included outright defamation, but hardly any arguments.)  

(类似于推特上的Bostrom迫害事件，其中包括公然的诽谤，但几乎没有任何争论。)

If you would consequently shun vagueness, then you couldn't even discourage violence, because the difference between violence and non-violence is gradual, it likewise admits of borderline cases.  

如果你因此而回避模糊性，那么你甚至不能阻止暴力，因为暴力和非暴力之间的区别是渐进的，它同样也承认有边界的情况。  

But since violence is bad despite borderline cases, the borderline cases and exceptions you cited also don't seem very serious. You never get perfectly precise definitions.  

但是，由于暴力是坏的，尽管有边界的情况，你所引用的边界的情况和例外情况也似乎不是很严重。你从来没有得到完全精确的定义。  

And you have to embrace some more vagueness than in the case of violence, unless you want to refer only to a tiny subset of irrational discourse.  

而且你必须接受比暴力更多的模糊性，除非你想只指非理性话语的一个极小的子集。

By the way, I would say banning/blocking is irrational when it is done in response to disagreement (often people on Twitter ban other people who merely disagree with them) and acceptable when off-topic or purely harassment.  

顺便说一句，我想说的是，当禁言/屏蔽是为了回应不同意见时，是不理性的（Twitter上经常有人禁言其他仅仅与他们意见不同的人），而当偏离主题或纯粹是骚扰时，是可以接受的。  

Sometimes there are borderline cases which lie in between, those are grey areas where blocking may be neither clearly bad nor clearly acceptable, but such grey areas are in no way counterexamples to the clear-cut cases.  

有时会有介于两者之间的边缘案例，那些灰色地带的封锁可能既不是明显的坏事，也不是明显的可接受的事，但这种灰色地带决不是明确的案例的反例。

我想知道人们是否有兴趣设立一些讨论帖子，在这些帖子中，具体的规范会被呼唤出来，以 "真诚地参与，但要努力打破这些具体的规范"

And people play a mix-and-match to see which ones are most fun, engaging and interesting for participants.  

而人们则玩起了混搭，看看哪些是最有趣、最吸引人、最让参与者感兴趣的。  

This would probably end in disaster if we started tossing slurs willy-nilly, but sometimes while reading posts, I think people could cut down on the verbiage by 90% and keep the meaning.  

如果我们开始随意折腾污言秽语，这可能会以灾难告终，但有时在阅读帖子时，我认为人们可以减少90%的言辞，并保持其意义。

Cultivating what Korzybski dubbed Consciousness of Abstraction (ie not unconsciously abstracting) improves things a lot eg noticing what metaphors are being deployed as part of an argument about the generalizability of your experience.  

培养科兹布斯基所称的抽象意识（即不无意识地抽象化）可以改善很多事情，例如注意到哪些隐喻被部署为关于你的经验的普遍性的论证的一部分。  

To develop this, it was useful to first do the easier task of noticing when and how others are abstracting.  

要发展这一点，首先要做的是注意到别人何时和如何进行抽象化这一比较容易的工作。

Should be "symmetric". From Scott's [post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/):  

应该是 "对称性"。来自斯科特的帖子：

You've also repeated the incorrect usage in [two](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse?commentId=psdzBAjvJyiF2tqa3) [comments](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/svuBpoSduzhYjFPrA/elements-of-rationalist-discourse?commentId=nHnNzJ836d5XLfwjz) to this post.  

你在这篇文章的两个评论中也重复了不正确的用法。

There is an interesting variation of rule 1 (truth-seeking). According to common understanding, this rule seems to imply that if we argue for X, we should only do so if we believe X to more than 50%.  

规则1（求真）有一个有趣的变化。根据通常的理解，这条规则似乎意味着，如果我们为X争论，我们应该只在我们相信X超过50%的情况下这样做。  

Similarly rule 3. But recently a number of philosophers have argued that (at least in academic context) you can actually argue for interesting hypotheses without believing in them.  

类似的还有规则3。但最近一些哲学家认为，（至少在学术方面）你实际上可以为有趣的假设进行论证而不相信它们。  

This is sometimes called "championing", and described as a form of epistemic group-rationality, which says that sometimes individually irrational arguments can be group-rational.  

这有时被称为 "拥护"，并被描述为一种认识论上的群体理性，即有时个别非理性的论证可以是群体理性的。

The idea is that truth seeking is viewed as a competitive-collaborative process, which has benefits when people specialize in certain outsider theories and champion them.  

这个想法是，寻求真理被看作是一个竞争-合作的过程，当人们专门研究某些局外人的理论并拥护它们时，就会有好处。  

In some contexts it is fairly likely that _some_ outsider theory is true, even though each individual outsider theory has a much lower probability than the competing mainstream theory.  

在某些情况下，某些局外人的理论相当可能是真的，尽管每个局外人理论的概率都比竞争的主流理论低很多。  

If everyone argued for the most likely (mainstream) theory, there would be too little "intellectual division of labor"; hardly anyone would bother arguing for individually unlikely theories.  

如果每个人都为最有可能的（主流）理论争辩，那么 "智力分工 "就太少了；几乎没有人愿意为个别不可能的理论争辩。

([This recent essay](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zp6wG5eQFLGWwcG6j/focus-on-the-places-where-you-feel-shocked-everyone-s) might be interpreted as an argument for championing.)  

(这篇最近的文章可能被解释为倡导的论点)。

It might be objected that the championers should be honest and report that they find the interesting theory they champion ultimately unlikely to be true.  

有人可能会反对说，拥护者应该诚实地报告，他们发现他们所拥护的有趣理论最终不可能是真的。  

But this could have bad effects for the truth-seeking process of the group: Why should anyone feel challenged by someone advocating a provocative hypothesis when the advocators themselves don't believe it?  

但是，这可能会对团体的真理探求过程产生不好的影响：当倡导者自己都不相信一个挑衅性的假说时，为什么要有人觉得受到了挑战？  

The hypothesis would lose much of its provocativeness, and the challenged people wouldn't really feel challenged. It wouldn't encourage fruitful debate.  

假设将失去大部分的挑衅性，被挑战的人也不会真正感到被挑战。它不会鼓励富有成效的辩论。

(This is can also be viewed as a solution to the disagreement paradox: Why could it ever be rational to disagree with our epistemic peers? Shouldn't we average our opinions?  

(这也可以被看作是对分歧悖论的一种解决方法：为什么与我们的认识论同行持不同意见是理性的？难道我们不应该把我们的意见平均化吗？  

Answer: Averaging might be individually rational, but not group-rational.)  

答案是：平均化可能是个人理性的，但不是群体理性的）。

> this rule seems to imply that if we argue for X, we should only do so if we believe X to more than 50%  
> 
> 这条规则似乎意味着，如果我们为X辩解，我们应该只在我们相信X超过50%的情况下才这样做。

Being an "argument for" is anti-inductive, an argument stops working in either direction once it's understood. You believe what you believe, at a level of credence you happen to have.  

作为一个 "论据 "是反归纳的，一个论据一旦被理解，就会在任何一个方向停止工作。你相信你所相信的，在你碰巧拥有的可信度的水平。  

You can make arguments. Others can change either understanding or belief in response to that. These things don't need to be related. And there is nothing special about 50%.  

你可以提出论点。其他人可以改变对它的理解或信仰，作为回应。这些事情不需要有关联。而且，50%也没有什么特别之处。

I don't get what you mean. Assuming you argue for X, but you don't believe X, it would seem something is wrong, at least from the individual rationality perspective.  

我不明白你的意思。假设你论证了X，但你不相信X，那么至少从个人理性的角度来看，似乎有些不对劲。  

For example, you argue that it raining outside without you believing that it is raining outside. This could e.g. be classified as lying (deception) or bullshitting (you don't care about the truth).  

例如，你争辩说外面在下雨，但你却不相信外面在下雨。这可以被归类为撒谎（欺骗）或胡说八道（你不关心真相）。

> Assuming you argue for X  
> 
> 假设你论证的是X

What does "arguing for" mean? There's expectation that a recipient changes their mind in some direction.  

"争论 "是什么意思？有期望收件人在某种方向上改变他们的想法。  

This expectation goes away for a given argument, once it's been considered, whether it had that effect or not.  

对于一个给定的论点来说，这种期望一旦被考虑到就会消失，不管它是否有这种效果。  

Repeating the argument won't present an expectation of changing the mind of a person who already knows it, in either direction, so the argument is no longer an "argument for". This is what I mean by [anti-inductive](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h24JGbmweNpWZfBkM/markets-are-anti-inductive).  

重复这个论点不会带来改变一个已经知道这个论点的人的想法的期望，无论在哪个方向，所以这个论点不再是一个 "论证"。这就是我所说的反归纳法。

> Assuming you argue for X, but you don't believe X  
> 
> 假设你论证了X，但你不相信X

Suppose you don't believe X, but someone doesn't understand an aspect of X, such that you expect its understanding to increase their belief in X. Is this an "argument for" X?  

假设你不相信X，但有人不理解X的某个方面，以至于你期望对它的理解能增加他们对X的信念。这是对X的 "论证 "吗？  

Should it be withheld, keeping the other's understanding avoidably lacking?  

是否应该扣留它，使对方的理解力可避免地缺失？

Here is a proposal: A argues with Y for X iff A 1) claims that Y, and 2) that Y is evidence for X, in the sense that P(X|Y)>P(X|-Y). The latter can be considered true even if you already believe in Y.  

这里有一个建议：A为X与Y争论，如果A 1）声称Y，和2）Y是X的证据，在P（X|Y）>P（X|Y）的意义上。后者可以被认为是真实的，即使你已经相信了Y。

I agree, that's a good argument.  

我同意，这是个很好的论点。

The best arguments confer no evidence, they guide you in putting together the pieces you already hold.  

最好的论据不赋予任何证据，它们指导你把你已经持有的碎片拼凑起来。

Yeah, aka Socratic dialogue.  

是的，又称苏格拉底对话。

Alice: I don't believe X.  

爱丽丝：我不相信X。

Bob: Don't you believe Y? And don't you believe If Y then X?  

鲍勃：你不相信Y吗？你也不相信如果Y，那么X？

Alice: Okay I guess I do believe X.  

爱丽丝：好吧，我想我确实相信X。

The point is, conditional probability doesn't capture the effect of arguments.  

关键是，条件概率并不能捕捉到论据的效果。

It seems that arguments provide evidence, and Y is evidence for X if and only if . That is, when X and Y are positively probabilistically dependent. If I think that they are positively dependent, and you think that they are not, then this won't convince you of course.  

似乎论据提供了证据，而Y是X的证据，当且仅当P ( X | Y ) > P ( X | ¬ Y ) 。也就是说，当X和Y在概率上是正相关的。如果我认为它们是正向依赖的，而你认为它们不是，那么这当然不能说服你了。

> Assuming you argue for X, but you don't believe X, it would seem something is wrong, at least from the individual rationality perspective.

Belief is a matter of degree. If someone else thinks it's 10% likely to be raining, and you believe it's 40% likely to be raining, then we could summarize that as "both of you think it's not raining".  

信念是一个程度问题。如果别人认为有10%的可能会下雨，而你认为有40%的可能会下雨，那么我们可以把它概括为 "你们俩都认为不会下雨"。  

And if you share some of your evidence and reasoning for thinking the probability is more like 40% than 10%, then we could maybe say that this isn't really arguing for the proposition "it's raining", but rather the proposition "rain is likelier than you think" or "rain is 40% likely" or whatever.  

如果你分享一些你认为概率是40%而不是10%的证据和推理，那么我们也许可以说这并不是真正在论证 "下雨了 "这一命题，而是论证 "下雨比你想象的更有可能 "或 "下雨的可能性是40%"或其他什么。

But in both cases there's something a bit odd about phrasing things this way, something that cuts a bit skew to reality.  

但在这两种情况下，以这种方式措辞有些奇怪，有些东西对现实有一点倾斜。  

In reality there's nothing special about the 50% point, and belief isn't a binary.  

在现实中，50%的点没有什么特别之处，信仰也不是一个二进制。  

So I think part of the objection here is: maybe what you're saying about belief and argument is technically true, but it's weird to think and speak that way because in fact the cognitive act of assigning 40% probability to something is very similar to the act of assigning 60% probability to something, and the act of citing evidence for rain when you have the former belief is often just completely identical to the act of citing evidence for rain when you have the latter belief.  

因此，我认为这里的部分反对意见是：也许你所说的关于信念和论证在技术上是正确的，但这样想和说是很奇怪的，因为事实上，对某件事情赋予40%的概率的认知行为与对某件事情赋予60%的概率的行为非常相似，当你有前一种信念时，引用下雨的证据的行为往往就是与你有后一种信念时引用下雨的证据的行为完全相同。

The issue for discourse is that beliefs do come in degrees, but when expressing them they lose this feature. Declarative statements are mostly discrete.  

话语的问题是，信仰确实有程度之分，但在表达信仰时，却失去了这个特点。陈述性语句大多是离散的。  

(Saying "It's raining outside" doesn't communicate how strongly you believe it, except to more than 50% -- but again, the fan of championing will deny even that in certain discourse contexts.)  

(说 "外面在下雨 "并不能传达出你有多强烈的信念，除了超过50%的人--但同样，拥护者在某些话语背景下甚至会否认这一点。)

Talking explicitly about probabilities is a workaround, a hack where we still make binary statements, just _about_ probabilities. But talking about probabilities is kind of unnatural, and people (even rationalists) rarely do it.  

明确地谈论概率是一种变通，是一种黑客，我们仍然做二元陈述，只是关于概率。但谈论概率是一种不自然的行为，人们（甚至是理性主义者）很少这样做。  

Notice how both of us made a lot of declarative statements without indicating our degrees of belief in them.  

注意到我们两个人都做了很多陈述性的声明，但没有表明我们对它们的相信程度。  

The best we can do, without using explicit probabilities, is using qualifiers like "I believe that", "It might be that", "It seems that", "Probably", "Possibly", "Definitely", "I'm pretty sure that" etc. See [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/joy1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/joy1.png)  

在不使用明确的概率的情况下，我们能做的最好的事情是使用限定词，如 "我相信"、"可能是"、"似乎是"、"可能"、"可能"、"肯定"、"我很确定 "等等。见 [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/joy1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/joy1.png) 。

I've rewritten this post [for the EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JnijsXwYDCJDwRcuc/elements-of-rationalist-discourse), to help introduce more EAs to rationalist culture and norms. The rewrite goes into more detail about a lot of the points, explaining jargon, motivating some of the less intuitive norms, etc.  

我为EA论坛重写了这个帖子，以帮助向更多的EA介绍理性主义文化和规范。重写后的文章对很多观点进行了更详细的说明，解释了专业术语，激励了一些不太直观的规范，等等。  

I expect some folks will prefer that version, and some will prefer the LW version.  

我预计有些人将会喜欢这个版本，有些人将会喜欢LW版本。

(One shortcoming of the EA Forum version is that it's less concise.  

(EA论坛版本的一个缺点是它不太简明。  

Another shortcoming is that there's more chance I got stuff wrong, since I erred on the side of "spell things out more in the hope of conveying more of the spirit to people who are new to this stuff", rather than "leave more implicit so that the things I say out loud can all be things I feel _really_ confident about".)  

另一个缺点是，我有更多的机会弄错东西，因为我偏向于 "把事情说得更清楚，希望能把更多的精神传达给刚接触这些东西的人"，而不是 "留下更多隐含的东西，以便我大声说出来的东西都是我真正有信心的东西"）。

Curate. I want to curate this post in the same manner that [Raemon curated](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPv4sYrKnPzeJASuk/basics-of-rationalist-discourse-1?commentId=WtkAYotHes59ggwab) [Basics of Rationalist Discourse](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPv4sYrKnPzeJASuk/basics-of-rationalist-discourse-1). This post contains a list of non-universal/non-standard ways for people to communicate, that do allow for better truthseeking.  

策划。我想以雷蒙策划《理性主义话语基础》的方式来策划这个帖子。这个帖子包含了一个非普遍的/非标准的人们交流方式的清单，这些方式确实可以更好地寻求真理。  

These are two recent posts on the topic, but I'd be keen to see more exploration of how do we communicate better, and how we can quickly get many more new people to pick up these ideals and methods.  

这是最近关于这个主题的两篇文章，但我很希望看到更多关于我们如何更好地沟通的探索，以及我们如何能够迅速让更多的新人接受这些理想和方法。

Basically: whether something is good or bad, enjoyable or unpleasant, desirable or undesirable, interesting or boring, etc.  

基本上：一件事是好还是坏，是愉快还是不愉快，是可取还是不可取，是有趣还是无聊，等等。  

It's the aspect of experience that evaluates some things as better or worse to varying degrees and in various respects.  

这是经验的方面，在不同程度和不同方面评价一些事情的好坏。

i may be should (and probably will not) write my own post about Goodwill. instead i will say in comment what Goodwill is about, by my definition.   

我可能应该（也可能不会）写我自己的关于Goodwill的帖子。而我将在评论中说说Goodwill是什么，根据我的定义。

Goodwill, the way i see it, on the emotional level, is basically respect and cooperation.  

在我看来，善意，在情感层面，基本上是尊重和合作。  

when someone make an argument, do you try to see to what area in ConceptSpace they are trying to gesturing, and then asking clarifying questions to understand, or do you round it up to the nearest stupid position, and not even see the actual argument being made?  

当有人提出论点时，你是想看看他们在ConceptSpace的哪个领域做了什么手势，然后提出澄清的问题来理解，还是把它四舍五入到最接近的愚蠢位置，甚至不看正在提出的实际论点？  

do you even see then saying something incoherent and try to parse it, instead of proving it wrong?  

你甚至看到然后说一些不连贯的东西，并试图解析它，而不是证明它的错误？

the standard definition of Goodwill does not include the ways in which failure of Goodwill is failure of rationality.  

商誉的标准定义并不包括商誉的失败是理性的失败的方式。  

is failure of seeing what someone is trying to say, to understand their position and their framing.  

是没有看到别人想说什么，没有理解他们的立场和他们的框架。

civility is good for its own sake. but almost everyone who decided to be uncivil end up strawmanning their opponents, end up with more wrong map of the world.  

但几乎所有决定不文明的人最终都会以草菅人命的方式对待他们的对手，最终得到更多错误的世界地图。  

what may look like forgiveness from outside, for rationalist, should look from inside like remembering that we [expect short inferential distances](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLqWn5LASfhhArZ7w/expecting-short-inferential-distances) and that [politics wrecks your ability to do math](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/new-study-politics-makes-you-innumerate/) and your believes fi[lter your](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755706) [receptions](https://www.all-about-psychology.com/selective-perception.html), so depends on your side in argument.  

对于理性主义者来说，从外面看可能是宽恕，从里面看应该是记住我们期望的推理距离很短，政治破坏了你做数学的能力，你的信仰过滤了你的接收，所以取决于你在争论中的立场。

i gained my understanding of those phenomenons mostly from the Rational Blogosphere, and saw it as part of rationality.  

我对这些现象的理解主要是从理性博客圈获得的，并将其视为理性的一部分。  

there is important difference between person executing the algorithm "being civil and forgiving", and people executing algorithm "remember about biases and inferential distances, and try to overcome them", that implemented by understanding the importance of cooperating even after perceived defection in noisy environment, in the prisoner's dilemma, and by assuming that communication is hard ind miscommunications are frequent, etc.  

执行 "文明和宽容 "算法的人与执行 "记住偏见和推理距离，并努力克服它们 "算法的人之间存在着重要的区别，即通过理解合作的重要性，即使在嘈杂的环境中，在囚徒的困境中，以及通过假设沟通是困难的，错误沟通是频繁的，等等。

I think that's right, but in my list I'm trying to factor out non-strawmanning as "alternative-minding", and civility under "goodwill".  

我想这是对的，但在我的清单中，我试图把不拖泥带水作为 "替代性思维 "来考虑，而把文明程度放在 "善意 "之下。

I think there _are_ anti-strawmanning benefits to being friendly, but I'm wary of trying to cash out _everything_ that's a good idea as "oh yeah, this is good because it helps individuals see the truth better", when that's not actually true for every good idea.  

我认为友好有反草率的好处，但我对试图把所有的好主意都兑现为 "哦，是的，这是好的，因为它能帮助个人更好地看到真相 "持谨慎态度，而实际上并不是每个好主意都是如此。

In this case, I think there are two things worth keeping distinct: the goal of understanding others' views in a discussion, and the goal of making discussion happen at all.  

在这种情况下，我认为有两件事值得区别对待：在讨论中理解他人的观点的目标，以及使讨论发生的目标。  

Civility helps keep social environments fun and chill enough that people stick around, are interested in engaging, and don't go into the conversation feeling triggered or defensive.  

礼貌有助于保持社交环境的乐趣和冷静，使人们坚持下去，有兴趣参与，并且不会在谈话中感到被触发或防卫。  

That's worth protecting, IMO, even if there's no risk that yelling at people (or whatever) will directly cause you to straw-man them.  

这值得保护，IMO，即使没有风险，对人大喊大叫（或其他）会直接导致你草菅人命。

so i thought about you comment and i understand why we think about that in different ways.  

所以我想了想你的评论，我明白为什么我们会以不同的方式思考这个问题。

in my model of the world, there is important concept - Goodwill.  

在我的世界模型中，有一个重要的概念--善意。  

there are arrows that point toward it, things that create goodwill - niceness, same side politically, personal relationship, all sort of things.  

有指向它的箭头，有创造善意的东西--友好、政治上的同一阵线、个人关系，所有这些东西。  

there are also things that destroy goodwill, or even move it to the negative numbers.  

也有一些事情会破坏商誉，甚至使其变成负数。

there are arrows that come out of this Goodwill node in my casual graph. things like System1 understand what actually said, tend to react nicely to things, able to pass ITT.  

在我的随意图中，有一些箭头从这个善意的节点出来。像System1理解实际说的是什么，倾向于对事情作出良好的反应，能够通过ITT。  

some things you can get other ways - people can be polite to people they hate, especially on the internet. but there are things that i saw only as result of Goodwill.  

有些东西你可以通过其他方式得到--人们可以对他们讨厌的人有礼貌，特别是在互联网上。但有些东西我只看到是善意的结果。  

and System1 correct interpretation is one of them/ maybe it's possible - but i never saw it. and the politeness you get without Goodwill, is shallow.  

而系统1的正确解释是其中之一/也许有可能--但我从未见过。而你没有善意得到的礼貌，是浅薄的。  

people's System1 notice that in body language, and even in writing.  

人们的系统1注意到，在身体语言中，甚至在写作中。

now, you can dial back on needless insulting and condescension. those are adversarial moves that can be chose consciously or avoided, even with effort.  

现在，你可以减少无谓的侮辱和居高临下的态度。这些都是对抗性的动作，可以有意识地选择或避免，甚至可以努力避免。  

but from my point of view, when there is so little Goodwill left, the chance for good discussion already lost. it can only be bad and very bad. avoiding very bad is important!  

但从我的角度来看，当善意所剩无几时，已经失去了讨论善意的机会。它只能是坏的和非常坏的。避免非常坏是很重要的！  

but my aim in such situations is to leave the discussion when the goodwill come close to zero, and have mental alarm screaming at me if i ever in the negative numbers of feel like the other person have negative numbers of Goodwill toward me.  

但在这种情况下，我的目标是当善意接近零时离开讨论，如果我觉得对方对我的善意为负数时，我就会有心理上的警报声响起。

so, basically, in my model of the world, there is ONE node, Goodwill. in the world, there is no different things.  

所以，基本上，在我的世界模型中，有一个节点，即善意。在这个世界上，没有不同的东西。  

you write: "even if there's no risk that yelling at people (or whatever) will directly cause you to straw-man them.". but in my model, such situation is impossible!  

你写道："即使没有风险，对人大喊大叫（或其他什么）会直接导致你草菅人命。"。但在我的模型中，这种情况是不可能的  

yelling at people WILL cause you to strawman them.   

对人大喊大叫会导致你草菅人命。

in my model of the world, this fact is not public knowledge, and my model regarding that is important part of what i want to communicate when I'm talking about Goodwill.   

在我的世界模型中，这一事实并不为公众所知，而我的模型关于这一点是我在谈论Goodwill时想要传达的重要部分。

thanks for the conversion! it's the clearest way i ever described my concept of Goodwill, and it was useful for my to formulate that in words.  

谢谢你的转换！这是我描述我的善意概念的最清晰的方式，对我来说，用文字来表述是很有用的。

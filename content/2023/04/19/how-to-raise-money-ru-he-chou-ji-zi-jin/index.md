Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  

大多数筹集资金的初创企业都不止一次。  

A typical trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then (2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company, and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth.  

一个典型的轨迹可能是：（1）从Y Combinator或个人天使那里得到几万块钱开始，然后（2）筹集几十万到几百万来建立公司，然后（3）一旦公司明显成功，再筹集一轮或更多的资金来加速发展。

Reality can be messier. Some companies raise money twice in phase 2. Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2. And at Y Combinator we get an increasing number of companies that have already raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  

现实可能更混乱。一些公司在第二阶段筹集了两次资金。其他人则跳过第一阶段，直接进入第二阶段。而在Y Combinator，我们有越来越多的公司已经筹集了数十万的资金。  

But the three phase path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths oscillate.  

但三相路径至少是关于个别创业公司的路径振荡的。

This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising. That's the type the startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice we give them.  

这篇文章的重点是第二阶段的筹款。这是我们资助的初创企业在演示日所做的类型，而这篇文章是我们给他们的建议。

**Forces**

Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight, and hard like solving a puzzle.  

筹款在两种意义上都是艰难的：像举重一样艰难，像解谜一样艰难。  

It's hard like lifting a weight because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with large sums of money. That problem is irreducible; it should be hard.  

这就像举重一样困难，因为要说服人们拿出大笔的钱，这在本质上是困难的。这个问题是不可复制的；它应该是困难的。  

But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated. Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.  

但是，其他类型的困难大部分是可以消除的。筹资似乎只是一个难题，因为它对大多数创始人来说是一个陌生的世界，我希望通过提供一张地图来解决这个问题。

To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they deliberately mislead you.  

对创始人来说，投资者的行为往往是不透明的--部分原因是他们的动机是模糊的，但部分原因是他们故意误导你。  

And the misleading ways of investors combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders. At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series of explosions as these two volatile components combine. \[[1](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f1n)\]  

投资者的误导方式与缺乏经验的创始人的一厢情愿的想法可怕地结合起来。在YC，我们总是提醒创始人注意这种危险，投资者对YC的初创公司可能比对其他公司更谨慎，即使如此，我们还是目睹了这两个不稳定因素结合在一起时不断发生的一系列爆炸。\[1\]

If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by imposing external constraints on yourself. You can't trust your intuitions.  

如果你是一个没有经验的创始人，唯一的生存方式就是给自己施加外部约束。你不能相信自己的直觉。  

I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will get you through this process if anything will. At certain moments you'll be tempted to ignore them.  

我将在这里给你一套规则，如果有什么可以让你通过这个过程。在某些时刻，你会很想忽略它们。  

So rule number zero is: these rules exist for a reason. You wouldn't need a rule to keep you going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you in another.  

所以零号规则是：这些规则的存在是有原因的。如果没有强大的力量把你推向另一个方向，你就不需要一个规则来让你朝一个方向前进。

The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors.  

作用在你身上的力量的最终来源是作用在投资者身上的力量。  

Investors are pinched between two kinds of fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing out on startups that take off.  

投资者被夹在两种恐惧之间：害怕投资于泡汤的初创企业，以及害怕错过起飞的初创企业。  

The cause of all this fear is the very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the successful ones grow very fast. But that fast growth means investors can't wait around.  

所有这些恐惧的原因正是使初创企业如此有吸引力的投资：成功的初创企业增长非常快。但这种快速增长意味着投资者不能再等下去了。  

If you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late. To get the really high returns, you have to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do.  

如果你等到一个初创企业明显成功了，那就太晚了。为了获得真正的高额回报，你必须在初创企业还不清楚它们会如何发展的时候投资。  

But that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop. As indeed they often are.  

但这反过来又使投资者紧张，他们即将投资于一个失败的项目。事实上，他们经常是这样。

What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait. When a startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you significantly more information about them.  

如果可以的话，投资者想做的是等待。当一个初创企业只有几个月大的时候，每过一周，你就会得到关于他们的明显更多信息。  

But if you wait too long, other investors might take the deal away from you. And of course the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  

但如果你等得太久，其他投资者可能会把交易从你手中夺走。当然，其他投资者也都会受到同样的力量影响。  

So what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can, then when some act the rest have to.  

所以往往发生的情况是，他们都尽可能地等待，然后当一些人采取行动时，其他人也不得不采取行动。

**Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.  

除非你想要它，它也想要你，否则不要筹集资金。**

Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup. Actually it isn't. [Rapid growth](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html) is what makes a company a startup.  

如此高比例的成功创业公司都会筹集资金，似乎筹资是创业公司的决定性品质之一。实际上不是这样的。 快速增长是使公司成为创业公司的原因。  

Most companies in a position to grow rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster, and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money. It's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful startup that practically all do raise outside money.  

大多数有能力快速发展的公司发现，（a）接受外部资金有助于他们更快成长，（b）他们的增长潜力使他们很容易吸引这些资金。对于一个成功的初创企业来说，(a)和(b)都是很常见的，实际上所有的公司都会筹集到外部资金。  

But there may be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or outside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them, don't raise money.  

但是，可能会有这样的情况，一家初创企业要么不想发展得更快，要么外面的钱不能帮助他们，如果你是其中之一，就不要筹集资金。

The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to. If you try to raise money before you can [convince](http://paulgraham.com/convince.html) investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your reputation with those investors.  

另一个不筹钱的时候是你将无法筹到钱的时候。如果你在能够说服投资者之前就试图筹集资金，你不仅会浪费你的时间，而且还会烧毁你在这些投资者那里的声誉。

**Be in fundraising mode or not.  

是否处于筹款模式。**

One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is. When you start fundraising, everything else grinds to a halt.  

关于筹款，最让创始人吃惊的事情之一是它是多么令人分心。当你开始筹款时，其他一切都会停滞不前。  

The problem is not the time fundraising consumes but that it becomes the [top idea in your mind](http://paulgraham.com/top.html). A startup can't endure that level of distraction for long. An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders [make](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) it grow, and if the founders look away, growth usually drops sharply.  

问题不在于筹款所消耗的时间，而在于它成为你头脑中的首要想法。一个初创企业不能长期忍受这种程度的分心。一个早期创业公司的成长主要是因为创始人让它成长，如果创始人看走眼了，成长通常会急剧下降。

Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be in fundraising mode or not.  

因为筹款是如此令人心烦意乱，一家初创企业要么进入筹款模式，要么不进入。  

And when you do decide to raise money, you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done quickly and get back to work. \[[2](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f2n)\]  

而当你决定筹集资金时，你应该把你的全部注意力集中在它上面，这样你就可以迅速完成它，并回到工作中去。\[2\]

You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising mode. You just can't expend any attention on it.  

当你不在筹款模式中时，你可以从投资者那里拿钱。你只是不能在这上面花费任何注意力。  

There are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating with them.  

有两件事需要注意：说服投资者，以及与他们谈判。  

So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation.  

因此，当你不处于筹款模式时，你应该从投资者那里拿钱，只有当他们不需要说服力，并且愿意按照你不需要谈判的条件进行投资。  

For example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think. \[[3](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f3n)\] The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next equity round. And "no convincing" means just that: zero time spent meeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  

例如，如果一个有信誉的投资者愿意用可转换票据进行投资，使用标准的文书工作，不设上限或以良好的估值为上限，你可以不用考虑就接受。\[3\] 条款将是你下一轮股权投资中的任何条款。而 "没有说服力 "就意味着：与投资者见面或为他们准备材料的时间为零。  

If an investor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come in for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if you're not in fundraising mode, because that's fundraising. \[[4](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f4n)\] Tell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right now, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but do not get sucked down the slippery slope.  

如果投资者说他们准备投资，但他们需要你来开一次会，见见一些合伙人，请告诉他们不要，如果你不是在筹款模式，因为那就是筹款。\[4\] 礼貌地告诉他们；告诉他们你现在正专注于公司，当你筹款时，你会回到他们身边；但不要被吸到滑坡上。

Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not. It's great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a shot at you before everyone else.  

投资者会试图在你不在的时候引诱你去筹款。如果可以的话，这对他们来说是很好的，因为他们可以由此在其他人之前获得对你的机会。  

They'll send you emails saying they want to meet to learn more about you. If you get cold-emailed by an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are in fundraising mode.  

他们会给你发电子邮件，说他们想见面，以了解你的情况。如果你被风险投资公司的同事冷落，即使你处于筹款状态，也不应该见面。  

Deals don't happen that way. \[[5](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f5n)\] But even if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting till you're in fundraising mode.  

交易不可能以这种方式发生。\[5\] 但是，即使你收到合作伙伴的电子邮件，你也应该尽量推迟见面，直到你进入筹款模式。  

They may say they just want to meet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat. What if they like you? What if they start to talk about giving you money?  

他们可能会说他们只是想见面聊天，但投资者从来不会只想见面聊天。如果他们喜欢你呢？如果他们开始说要给你钱呢？  

Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  

你能忍住不进行这种对话吗？  

Unless you're experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them that you'd be happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you need to focus on the company. \[[6](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f6n)\]  

除非你在筹款方面有足够的经验，能够与投资者进行保持随意的交谈，否则告诉他们你很乐意以后在筹款时进行，但现在你需要专注于公司的发展，这样更安全。\[6\]

Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes tack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  

在第二阶段成功筹资的公司有时会在离开筹资模式后增加一些投资者。  

This is fine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without spending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.  

这很好；如果筹款顺利，你就可以不花时间说服他们或就条款进行谈判。

**Get introductions to investors.  

获得投资者的介绍。**

Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them. If you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole bunch simultaneously.  

在你能与投资者交谈之前，你必须被介绍给他们。如果你在演示日做演讲，你会被同时介绍给一大堆人。  

But even if you are, you should supplement these with intros you collect yourself.  

但是，即使你是，你也应该用你自己收集的介绍来补充这些。

Do you have to be introduced? In phase 2, yes.  

你必须要被介绍吗？在第二阶段，是的。  

Some investors will let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the way their sites are organized that they don't really want startups to approach them directly.  

有些投资者会让你把商业计划书电邮给他们，但你可以从他们网站的组织方式中看出，他们并不希望初创企业直接接触他们。

Intros vary greatly in effectiveness. The best type of intro is from a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  

介绍的效果差别很大。最好的介绍类型是来自一个刚刚投资于你的知名投资者。  

So when you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other investors they respect. \[[7](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f7n)\] The next best type of intro is from a founder of a company they've funded. You can also get intros from other people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.  

因此，当你得到一个投资者的承诺时，请他们把你介绍给他们尊敬的其他投资者。\[7\] 其次，最好的介绍是来自他们所资助的公司的创始人。你也可以从创业社区的其他人那里得到介绍，比如律师和记者。

There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that can introduce you to investors. We recommend startups treat them as auxiliary sources of money.  

现在有一些网站，如AngelList、FundersClub和WeFunder，可以把你介绍给投资者。我们建议初创企业把它们作为辅助性的资金来源。  

Raise money first from leads you get yourself. Those will on average be better investors.  

首先从你自己得到的线索中筹集资金。这些人平均来说会是更好的投资者。  

Plus you'll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you can say you've already raised some from well-known investors.  

另外，一旦你能说你已经从知名投资者那里筹集了一些资金，你就会更容易在这些网站上筹资。

**Hear no till you hear yes.  

听到 "不"，直到听到 "是"。**

Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in the form of a definite offer with no contingencies.  

在投资者明确说 "是 "之前，应将其视为 "不"，即以明确的报价形式，不附带任何条件。

I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can. What's particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait. Essentially, they lead you on.  

我之前提到，如果可以的话，投资者更喜欢等待。对创始人来说，特别危险的是他们的等待方式。从本质上讲，他们是在引导你。  

They seem like they're about to invest right up till the moment they say no. If they even say no. Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop replying to your emails.  

他们看起来像是要投资，直到他们说不的那一刻。如果他们甚至说不。一些更糟糕的人实际上从未说过不；他们只是停止回复你的电子邮件。  

They hope that way to get a free option on investing.  

他们希望通过这种方式获得投资上的免费选择。  

If they decide later that they want to invest — usually because they've heard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they just got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they'd been about to. \[[8](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f8n)\]  

如果他们后来决定要投资--通常是因为他们听说你是个热门交易--他们可以假装他们只是分心了，然后重新开始谈话，就好像他们已经要投资了。\[8\]

That's not the worst thing investors will do. Some will use language that makes it sound as if they're committing, but which doesn't actually commit them.  

这还不是投资者会做的最糟糕的事情。有些人会使用一些语言，使其听起来好像他们在承诺，但实际上并没有承诺。  

And wishful thinking founders are happy to meet them half way. \[[9](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f9n)\]  

而一厢情愿的创始人也很乐意与他们半路相逢。\[9\]

Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior. But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that sounds like yes.  

幸运的是，下一条规则是一种中和这种行为的策略。但要发挥作用，取决于你不被听起来像 "是 "的拒绝所欺骗。  

It's so common for founders to be misled/mistaken about this that we designed a [protocol](http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html) to fix the problem. If you believe an investor has committed, get them to confirm it.  

创始人在这方面被误导/误解的情况非常普遍，我们设计了一个协议来解决这个问题。如果你相信投资者已经承诺，让他们确认一下。  

If you and they have different views of reality, whether the source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful thinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will flush it out.  

如果你和他们对现实有不同的看法，无论差异的来源是他们的草率还是你的一厢情愿，以书面形式确认承诺的前景将冲淡它。  

And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.  

在他们确认之前，把他们看作是说不。

**Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.  

做广度优先的搜索，按预期值加权。**

When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search, weighted by expected value. You should always talk to investors in parallel rather than serially.  

当你与投资者交谈时，你的做法应该是广度优先的搜索，以预期价值为权重。你应该始终与投资者平行交谈，而不是连续交谈。  

You can't afford the time it takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one investor at a time, they don't have the pressure of other investors to make them act.  

你无法承担与投资者连续交谈所需的时间，另外，如果你一次只与一个投资者交谈，他们就没有其他投资者的压力来使他们采取行动。  

But you shouldn't pay the same attention to every investor, because some are more promising prospects than others. The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. \[[10](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f10n)\]  

但你不应该对每个投资者都给予同样的关注，因为有些投资者比其他投资者更有前途。最佳的解决方案是与所有潜在的投资者平行交谈，但对更有前途的投资者给予更高的优先权。\[10\]

Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied by how good it would be if they did.  

预期价值=投资者说 "是 "的可能性，乘以如果他们说 "是 "会有多好。  

So for example, an eminent investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest much, but will be easy to convince.  

因此，举例来说，一个知名的投资者会投资很多，但很难被说服，他的预期价值可能与一个不知名的天使投资不多，但很容易被说服的人相同。  

Whereas an obscure angel who will only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple times before making up his mind, has very low expected value. Meet such investors last, if at all. \[[11](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f11n)\]  

而一个默默无闻的天使，只愿意投资少量的资金，却需要在下定决心之前多次见面，其预期价值非常低。与这样的投资者最后见面，如果有的话。\[11\]

Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you from investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away, because you'll drift away from them at the same rate.  

按预期价值加权做广度优先的搜索，会让你免于被那些从未明确说不，而只是渐行渐远的投资者所困扰，因为你会以同样的速度远离他们。  

It protects you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed algorithm protects you from processors that fail.  

它可以保护你免受投资者剥落的影响，就像分布式算法保护你免受处理器故障的影响一样。  

If some investor isn't returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but isn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically focus less on them.  

如果一些投资者不回你的电子邮件，或者想开很多会议，但没有向你提出报价的进展，你会自动减少对他们的关注。  

But you have to be disciplined about assigning probabilities. You can't let how much you want an investor influence your estimate of how much they want you.  

但你在分配概率方面必须有纪律。你不能让你对投资者的需求有多大影响你对他们对你的需求有多大的估计。

**Know where you stand.  

了解你的立场。**

How do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when investors habitually seem more positive than they are? By looking at their actions rather than their words.  

当投资者习惯性地看起来比他们更积极时，你如何判断你与投资者的关系有多好？通过观察他们的行动而不是他们的言论。  

Every investor has some track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring the money, and you should always know what that track consists of, where you are on it, and how fast you're moving forward.  

每个投资者都有一些他们需要沿着的轨道，从第一次谈话到汇钱，你应该始终知道这个轨道包括什么，你在哪里，以及你前进的速度。

Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens next. What more do they need in order to decide? Do they need another meeting with you? To talk about what? And how soon?  

在离开与投资者的会议时，不要不问接下来会发生什么。他们还需要什么来决定？他们需要再次与你会面吗？谈些什么？多长时间？  

Do they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners, or investigate some issue? How long do they expect it to take? Don't be too pushy, but know where you stand.  

他们是否需要在内部做一些事情，比如与他们的伙伴交谈，或者调查一些问题？他们预计要花多长时间？不要太咄咄逼人，但要知道你的立场。  

If investors are vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because they're already running through that in their heads. \[[12](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f12n)\]  

如果投资者含糊其辞或抵制回答这类问题，那就做最坏的打算；对你认真感兴趣的投资者通常会很乐意谈论从现在到发钱之间必须发生的事情，因为他们已经在脑子里想好了。\[12\]

If you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask such questions. \[[13](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f13n)\] If you're not, there's a trick you can use in this situation. Investors know you're inexperienced at raising money. Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive.  

如果你有谈判经验，你已经知道如何问这样的问题。\[13\] 如果你不是，在这种情况下你可以使用一个技巧。投资者知道你在筹集资金方面没有经验。没有经验并不意味着你没有吸引力。  

Being a noob at technology would, if you're starting a technology startup, but not being a noob at fundraising. Larry and Sergey were noobs at fundraising.  

如果你要创办一家技术创业公司，成为技术方面的新手也是可以的，但不能成为筹款方面的新手。拉里和谢尔盖是筹款方面的新手。  

So you can just confess that you're inexperienced at this and ask how their process works and where you are in it. \[[14](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f14n)\]  

因此，你可以直接承认你在这方面没有经验，并询问他们的流程如何运作，以及你在其中的位置。\[14\]

**Get the first commitment.  

获得第一个承诺。**

The biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion of [other investors](http://paulgraham.com/herd.html). Once you start getting investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to. But the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the first commitment.  

大多数投资者对你的看法的最大因素是其他投资者的看法。一旦你开始得到投资者的承诺，要得到更多的承诺就会变得越来越容易。但这个硬币的另一面是，往往很难得到第一个承诺。

Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty of fundraising. What counts as a substantial offer depends on who it's from and how much it is.  

获得第一个实质性的报价可能是筹款总难度的一半。什么算作实质性的提议，取决于是谁提出的，以及金额是多少。  

Money from friends and family doesn't usually count, no matter how much. But if you get $50k from a well known VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set things rolling. \[[15](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f15n)\]  

朋友和家人的钱通常不算数，无论多少。但是，如果你从知名的风险投资公司或天使投资人那里得到5万美元，这通常就足以让事情开始发展。\[15\]

**Close committed money.  

关闭承诺的资金。**

It's not a deal till the money's in the bank. I often hear inexperienced founders say things like "We've raised $800,000," only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  

在钱到账之前，这不是一个交易。我经常听到没有经验的创始人说 "我们已经筹集了80万美元 "这样的话，但却发现到目前为止，银行里的钱是零。  

Remember the twin fears that torment investors? The fear of missing out that makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd that results?  

还记得折磨投资者的双重恐惧吗？害怕错失良机，使他们提前跳槽，以及害怕跳到大粪上，结果是什么？  

This is a market where people are exceptionally prone to buyer's remorse. And it's also one that furnishes them plenty of excuses to gratify it.  

这是一个人们特别容易产生买方悔意的市场。这也是一个为他们提供大量借口来满足他们的市场。  

The public markets snap startup investing around like a whip. If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all bets are off.  

公共市场像鞭子一样抽打着初创企业的投资。如果中国经济明天爆炸，所有的赌注都会消失。  

But there are lots of surprises for individual startups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising. Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&Ded, or your cofounder could quit. \[[16](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f16n)\]  

但对于单个创业公司来说，也有很多惊喜，而且往往集中在筹资方面。明天可能出现一个大的竞争对手，或者你可能被拆毁，或者你的联合创始人可能辞职。\[16\]

Even a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change their mind. So when someone commits, get the money. Knowing where you stand doesn't end when they say they'll invest.  

即使是一天的延迟也会带来导致投资者改变主意的消息。因此，当有人承诺时，要拿到钱。了解你的立场并不是在他们说要投资时才结束。  

After they say yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then babysit that process till it happens.  

在他们答应之后，要知道拿到钱的时间表是什么，然后照看这个过程直到它发生。  

Institutional investors have people in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels down in person to collect a check.  

机构投资者有负责汇钱的人，但你可能要亲自去找天使来领取支票。

Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer's remorse.  

没有经验的投资者是最有可能得到买方悔恨的人。  

Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve. But I've heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.  

老牌的风险投资公司已经学会了把答应当作跳水板上的跳水，而且他们也有更多的品牌需要维护。但我听说过一些案例，即使是顶级风险投资公司也在交易中打了折扣。

**Avoid investors who don't "lead."  

避免那些不 "领导 "的投资者。**

Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising, that should be part of your calculation of expected value when you start.  

由于获得第一个报价是筹款的大部分困难，这应该是你在开始时计算预期价值的一部分。  

You have to estimate not just the probability that an investor will say yes, but the probability that they'd be the _first_ to say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the former. Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those are extra valuable early on.  

你不仅要估计一个投资者说 "是 "的概率，还要估计他们是第一个说 "是 "的概率，而后者并不是前者的一个简单的恒定分数。有些投资者以快速决定而闻名，而这些人在早期是特别有价值的。

Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors have is worthless initially.  

反之，一个只有在其他投资者投资后才会投资的投资者，最初是没有价值的。  

And while most investors are influenced by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors have.  

虽然大多数投资者受到其他投资者对你感兴趣程度的影响，但也有一些人有一个明确的政策，即只有在其他投资者投资后才进行投资。  

You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor because they often talk about "leads." They say that they don't lead, or that they'll invest once you have a lead.  

你可以认出这种可鄙的投资者亚种，因为他们经常谈论 "线索"。他们说他们不领头，或者说一旦你有了线索他们就会投资。  

Sometimes they even claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean they won't invest till you get $x from other investors.  

有时他们甚至声称愿意自己领导，他们的意思是在你从其他投资者那里得到x美元之前他们不会投资。  

(It's great if by "lead" they mean they'll invest unilaterally, and in addition will help you raise more.  

(如果他们所说的 "领导 "是指他们会单方面投资，而且会帮助你筹集更多资金，那就太好了。  

What's lame is when they use the term to mean they won't invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.) \[[17](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f17n)\]  

最蹩脚的是当他们用这个词来表示他们不会投资，除非你能在其他地方筹集更多资金)。\[17\]

Where does this term "lead" come from?  

这个 "铅 "字是怎么来的？  

Up till a few years ago, startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds in which several investors invested at the same time using the same paperwork.  

直到几年前，在第二阶段筹集资金的初创企业通常会进行股权轮融资，其中几个投资者同时使用相同的文件进行投资。  

You'd negotiate the terms with one "lead" investor, and then all the others would sign the same documents and all the money change hands at the closing.  

你与一个 "主要 "投资者谈判条款，然后所有其他人签署同样的文件，所有的钱在成交时转手。

Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently for most fundraising prior to the series A. Now there are rarely actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  

A轮融资仍然是这样的，但现在对于A轮融资之前的大多数筹款来说，事情的运作方式是不同的。现在，在A轮融资之前很少有实际的融资，也很少有融资的线索。  

Now startups simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.  

现在，初创企业只是一次一次地从投资者那里筹集资金，直到他们觉得自己有足够的资金。

Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term? Because it's a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they really mean.  

既然已经没有线索了，为什么投资者还要使用这个词呢？因为它是一种听起来更合法的方式来表达他们的真实意思。  

All they really mean is that their interest in you is a function of other investors' interest in you. I.e. the spectral signature of all mediocre investors.  

他们真正的意思是，他们对你的兴趣是其他投资者对你兴趣的一个函数。也就是所有平庸的投资者的光谱特征。  

But when phrased in terms of leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore legitimate about their behavior.  

但是，当用线索来表述时，听起来好像他们的行为有一些结构性的东西，因此是合法的。

When an investor tells you "I want to invest in you, but I don't lead," translate that in your mind to "No, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal." And since that's the default opinion of any investor about any startup, they've essentially just told you nothing.  

当一个投资者告诉你 "我想投资你，但我没有领导权 "时，在你的脑海中把这句话翻译成 "不，除非你是一个热门的交易。"由于这是任何投资者对任何创业公司的默认意见，他们基本上没有告诉你什么。

When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor who won't "lead" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.  

当你刚开始筹款时，一个不会 "领导 "的投资者的预期价值是零，所以如果有的话，也要最后才与这样的投资者交谈。

**Have multiple plans.  

有多个计划。**

Many investors will ask how much you're planning to raise. This question makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a specific amount. But in fact you shouldn't.  

许多投资者会问你计划筹集多少钱。这个问题让创始人觉得他们应该计划筹集一个具体的金额。但事实上，你不应该这样做。  

It's a mistake to have fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.  

在像筹款这样不可预测的事业中，制定固定的计划是一个错误。

So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  

那么，为什么投资者会问你计划筹集多少钱？  

For much the same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask "How much were you planning to spend?" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend. You probably didn't have a precise amount in mind; you just want to find something good, and if it's inexpensive, so much the better. The salesperson asks you this not because you're supposed to have a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only things that cost the most you'll pay.  

如果你走进商店为朋友寻找礼物，商店的售货员会问："你打算花多少钱？"原因大致相同。你可能并没有想好准确的金额；你只是想找到好东西，如果它是廉价的，那就更好了。销售人员问你这个问题，并不是因为你应该有一个花费特定金额的计划，而是为了让他们只向你展示那些你最需要的东西。

Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it's not because you're supposed to have a plan.  

同样，当投资者问你计划筹集多少资金时，这不是因为你应该有一个计划。  

It's to see whether you'd be a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to make, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far you are along with fundraising.  

这是为了看你是否是他们喜欢的投资规模的合适接受者，也是为了判断你的野心、合理性，以及你在筹款方面的进展情况。

If you're a wizard at fundraising, you can say "We plan to raise a $7 million series A round, and we'll be accepting termsheets next tuesday." I've known a handful of founders who could pull that off without having VCs laugh in their faces.  

如果你是一个筹款的向导，你可以说 "我们计划筹集700万美元的A轮融资，我们将在下周二接受条款表"。我认识的几个创始人都能做到这一点，而不会让风险投资商嘲笑他们。  

But if you're in the inexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to the solution I recommend for [pitching](http://paulgraham.com/convince.html) your startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what you're doing.  

但是，如果你属于没有经验但很认真的大多数人，解决办法类似于我推荐的推销你的创业公司的办法：做正确的事情，然后告诉投资者你在做什么。

And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans depending on how much you can raise.  

而正确的策略，在筹款方面，是根据你能筹到多少钱，制定多个计划。  

Ideally you should be able to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.  

理想情况下，你应该能够告诉投资者这样的话：我们不需要再筹集任何资金就能实现盈利，但如果我们筹集到几十万，我们就能雇佣一两个聪明的朋友，如果我们筹集到几百万，我们就能雇佣整个工程团队，等等。

Different plans match different investors.  

不同的计划匹配不同的投资者。  

If you're talking to a VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your most expensive plan.  

如果你和一家只做A轮融资的风险投资公司谈话（尽管这种公司已经很少了），那么除了你最昂贵的计划外，谈论任何其他计划都是浪费时间。  

Whereas if you're talking to an angel who invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you probably want to focus on your least expensive plan.  

而如果你和一个每次投资2万美元的天使交谈，而你还没有筹集到任何资金，你可能想把重点放在你的最低成本计划上。

If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  

如果你很幸运，不得不考虑你应该提高的上限，一个好的经验法则是将你想雇用的人数乘以15000美元再乘以18个月。  

In most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost (including benefits and even office space) per person.  

在大多数初创企业中，几乎所有的成本都是人数的函数，每月1.5万美元是每个人的常规总成本（包括福利，甚至办公场所）。  

$15k per month is high, so don't actually spend that much. But it's ok to use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  

每月1.5万美元很高，所以实际上不要花那么多。但在筹款时使用一个高的估计值是可以的，以增加误差幅度。  

If you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at the end.  

如果你有额外的开支，如制造业，在最后加上这些。  

Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20 people, the most you'd want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4 million. \[[18](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f18n)\]  

假设你没有，而你认为你可能会雇用20人，那么你最想筹集的资金是20×15000美元×18=540万美元。\[18\]

**Underestimate how much you want.  

低估自己的需求量。**

Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of underestimating the amount you hope to raise.  

虽然在与不同类型的投资者交谈时，你可以专注于不同的计划，但总的来说，你应该偏向于低估你希望筹集的金额。

For example, if you'd like to raise $500k, it's better to say initially that you're trying to raise $250k. Then when you reach $150k you're more than half done.  

例如，如果你想筹集50万美元，最好一开始就说你想筹集25万美元。然后当你达到15万美元时，你就完成了一半以上。  

That sends two useful signals to investors: that you're doing well, and that they have to decide quickly because you're running out of room.  

这向投资者发出了两个有用的信号：一是你做得很好，二是他们必须迅速做出决定，因为你已经没有空间了。  

Whereas if you'd said you were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k. If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you'd start to read as a failure.  

而如果你说你要筹集50万美元，那么你在15万美元的时候就只完成了不到三分之一。如果筹款在那里停滞了相当长的时间，你就会开始被认为是一个失败者。

Saying initially that you're raising $250k doesn't limit you to raising that much. When you reach your initial target and you still have investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  

最初说你要筹集25万美元并不限制你筹集这么多。当你达到最初的目标时，如果投资者仍有兴趣，你可以决定筹集更多。  

Startups do that all the time. In fact, most startups that are very successful at fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.  

初创企业一直在这样做。事实上，大多数在筹款方面非常成功的初创企业最终筹集的资金都超过了他们最初的打算。

I'm not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your expectations initially. There is almost no downside in starting with a low number.  

我不是说你应该撒谎，而是说你应该在开始时降低你的期望。从一个低的数字开始，几乎没有坏处。  

It not only won't cap the amount you raise, but will on the whole tend to increase it.  

它不仅不会限制你的筹款额度，而且总体上会倾向于增加它。

A good metaphor here is angle of attack. If you try to fly at too steep an angle of attack, you just stall.  

这里有一个很好的比喻就是攻角。如果你试图以太陡的攻角飞行，你就会失速。  

If you say right out of the gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless you're in a very strong position, you not only won't get that but won't get anything.  

如果你一开始就说你想筹集500万美元的A轮融资，除非你处于非常强势的地位，否则你不仅不会得到，而且不会得到任何东西。  

Better to start at a low angle of attack, build up speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.  

最好从低攻角开始，积累速度，然后逐渐增加角度，如果你想。

**Be profitable if you can.  

如果可以的话，要有利可图。**

You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans includes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can make it to profitability without raising any additional money.  

如果你的计划集包括一个筹集零美元的计划，即如果你能在不筹集任何额外资金的情况下实现盈利，你将处于更有利的地位。  

Ideally you want to be able to say to investors "We'll succeed no matter what, but raising money will help us do it faster."  

理想情况下，你希望能够对投资者说："无论如何我们都会成功，但筹集资金将帮助我们更快地实现这一目标。"

There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this is one of the strongest. No one wants you if you seem desperate. And the best way not to seem desperate is not to _be_ desperate. That's one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low and to try to make it to [ramen profitability](http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html) before Demo Day. Though it sounds slightly paradoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do is get yourself to the point where you don't need to.  

筹款和约会之间有许多类比，这是最有力的一个。如果你看起来很绝望，没有人会要你。而不显得绝望的最好办法就是不绝望。这就是我们在YC期间敦促初创企业保持低开支的原因之一，并努力在演示日之前实现拉面的盈利。虽然这听起来有点矛盾，但如果你想筹集资金，你能做的最好的事情就是让自己达到不需要的程度。

There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which founders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that otherwise the company will die or at the very least people will have to be fired, and one in which founders who don't need money take some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues. To emphasize the distinction I'm going to name them: type A fundraising is when you don't need money, and type B fundraising is when you do.  

几乎有两种截然不同的筹款模式：一种是需要钱的创始人敲门寻求资金，因为他们知道，否则公司就会死掉，或者至少会有人被解雇；另一种是不需要钱的创始人拿一些钱来发展，比他们仅靠自己的收入要快。为了强调这种区别，我将为它们命名：A型筹款是当你不需要钱时，B型筹款是当你需要钱时。

Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was type A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since that seems to be how startups work.  

没有经验的创始人读到著名的初创企业做的是A类筹款，并决定他们也应该筹集资金，因为这似乎是初创企业的工作方式。  

Except when they raise money they don't have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing type B fundraising. And they are then surprised how difficult and unpleasant it is.  

除了当他们筹集资金时，他们没有明确的盈利途径，因此是在做B类筹款。然后他们就会惊讶于这是多么困难和不愉快的事情。

Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a few months.  

当然，不是所有的初创企业都能在几个月内实现拉面的盈利。  

And some that don't still manage to have the upper hand over investors, if they have some other advantage like extraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders. But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from a position of strength without being profitable. \[[19](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f19n)\]  

而一些不具备这种条件的企业仍然能够在投资者面前占得先机，如果它们有一些其他的优势，如非凡的增长数字或特别强大的创始人。但是，随着时间的推移，在没有盈利的情况下，要想从优势地位上进行筹资变得越来越困难。\[19\]

**Don't optimize for valuation.  

不要为估价而优化。**

When you raise money, what should your valuation be? The most important thing to understand about valuation is that it's not that important.  

当你筹集资金时，你的估值应该是多少？关于估值，最重要的一点是，它并不那么重要。

Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud of it.  

以高估值筹集资金的创始人往往会不适当地以此为荣。  

Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end up competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  

创始人往往是有竞争力的人，由于估值通常是附加在创业公司上的唯一可见的数字，他们最终会争相以最高的估值筹集资金。  

This is stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters. The real test is revenue. Fundraising is just a means to that end.  

这很愚蠢，因为筹款并不是重要的测试。真正的测试是收入。筹款只是达到这一目的的一种手段。  

Being proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of your college grades.  

为自己在筹款方面的表现感到自豪，就像为自己的大学成绩感到自豪。

Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not even the thing to optimize about fundraising.  

不仅筹款不是重要的测试，估值甚至不是优化筹款的事情。  

The number one thing you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your company. Number two is good investors.  

你从第二阶段筹款中想要的第一件事是获得你所需要的钱，这样你就可以回到专注于真正的测试，即你公司的成功。第二件事是好的投资者。  

Valuation is at best third.  

估值充其量是第三位。

The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  

经验性的证据表明它是多么的不重要。  

Dropbox and Airbnb are the most successful companies we've funded so far, and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of $4 million and $2.6 million respectively.  

Dropbox和Airbnb是我们迄今为止资助的最成功的公司，它们在Y Combinator之后分别以400万美元和260万美元的投资前估值筹集资金。  

Prices are so much higher now that if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at higher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb. So let that satisfy your competitiveness.  

现在的价格高得多，如果你能筹集到资金，你可能会以比Dropbox和Airbnb更高的估值筹集资金。所以让这一点来满足你的竞争力。  

You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb! At a test that doesn't matter.  

你比Dropbox和Airbnb做得更好!在一个并不重要的测试中。

When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation cap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who commits.  

当你开始筹款时，你的初始估值（或估值上限）将由你与第一个承诺的投资者达成的交易决定。  

You can increase the price for later investors, if you get a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from the first investor becomes your asking price.  

如果你有很多兴趣，你可以为后来的投资者提高价格，但默认情况下，你从第一个投资者那里得到的估值成为你的要价。

So if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies do in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first from an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to sustain.  

因此，如果你从多个投资者那里筹集资金，就像大多数公司在第二阶段所做的那样，你必须小心避免以你无法承受的价格从一个过于急切的投资者那里筹集第一笔资金。  

You can of course lower your price if you need to (in which case you should give the same terms to investors who invested earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in the process of realizing you need to do this.  

当然，如果你需要，你可以降低你的价格（在这种情况下，你应该给早期以较高价格投资的投资者同样的条件），但你可能在意识到你需要这样做的过程中失去一堆线索。

What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money from them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  

如果你有急切的第一个投资者，你可以做的是以带有最惠国待遇条款的无上限的可转换票据向他们筹集资金。  

This is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note will be determined by the next investors you raise money from.  

这基本上是说，票据的估值上限将由你的下一个投资者决定，你向他们筹集资金。

It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation. It shouldn't be, but it is.  

以较低的估值筹集资金会更容易。这不应该是这样，但它是。  

Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  

由于第二阶段的价格最多相差10倍，而大的成功产生的回报至少是100倍，投资者应该完全根据他们对公司获得大成功的概率的估计来挑选初创企业，而几乎不考虑价格。  

But although it's a mistake for investors to care about price, a significant number do. A startup that investors seem to like but won't invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2. \[[20](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f20n)\]  

但是，尽管投资者关心价格是一个错误，但有相当多的人关心。一家投资者似乎很喜欢，但在x美元上限时不会投资的创业公司，在x/2美元时就会更容易。

**Yes/no before valuation.  

是/否在估值前。**

Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even talk to you about investing.  

一些投资者在与你讨论投资问题之前，想知道你的估值是多少。  

If your valuation has already been set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can tell them that number.  

如果你的估值已经被之前的投资定在了一个特定的估值或上限，你可以告诉他们这个数字。  

But if it isn't set because you haven't closed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist doing so.  

但是，如果因为你还没有与任何人成交而没有确定，而他们试图逼你说出一个价格，请抵制这样做。  

If this would be the first investor you've closed, then this could be the tipping point of fundraising.  

如果这将是你完成的第一个投资者，那么这可能是筹款的转折点。  

That means closing this investor is the first priority, and you need to get the conversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a discussion of price.  

这意味着成交这个投资者是第一要务，你需要把对话转到这个问题上，而不是被拖到价格的讨论上。

Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation. And it is not just a negotiating trick; it's how you (both) should be operating.  

幸运的是，在这种情况下，有一种方法可以避免指名要价。这不仅仅是一个谈判技巧；这也是你们（双方）应该操作的方式。  

Tell them that valuation is not the most important thing to you and that you haven't thought much about it, that you are looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to partner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they want to invest at all.  

告诉他们，估值对你来说不是最重要的事情，你也没有多想，你正在寻找你想与之合作和想与你合作的投资者，你应该先谈谈他们是否想投资的问题。  

Then if they decide they do want to invest, you can figure out a price. But first things first.  

然后，如果他们决定他们确实想投资，你可以想出一个价格。但首先要做的是。

Since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling is, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits as low a price as they need to.  

由于估值并不那么重要，而让筹款滚动起来才是最重要的，我们通常会告诉创始人，给第一个承诺的投资者一个尽可能低的价格。  

This is a safe technique so long as you combine it with the next one. \[[21](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f21n)\]  

只要你把它与下一个技术结合起来，这就是一个安全的技术。\[21\]

**Beware "valuation sensitive" investors.  

谨防 "估值敏感 "的投资者。**

Occasionally you'll encounter investors who describe themselves as "valuation sensitive." What this means in practice is that they are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time trying to push your price down.  

偶尔你会遇到那些自称是 "估值敏感 "的投资者。这实际上意味着他们是强迫性的谈判者，会占用你大量的时间，试图把你的价格压低。  

You should therefore never approach such investors first.  

因此，你不应该先接触这类投资者。  

While you shouldn't chase high valuations, you also don't want your valuation to be set artificially low because the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive negotiator.  

虽然你不应该追逐高估值，但你也不希望你的估值被人为地定得很低，因为第一个承诺的投资者恰好是一个强迫性的谈判者。  

Some such investors have value, but the time to approach them is near the end of fundraising, when you're in a position to say "this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it" and not mind if they leave it.  

一些这样的投资者是有价值的，但接近他们的时机是在筹款接近尾声的时候，那时你可以说 "这是其他人付出的代价；要么接受，要么离开"，并且不介意他们离开。  

This way, you'll not only get market price, but it will also take less time.  

这样，你不仅能得到市场价格，而且还能花更少的时间。

Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being "valuation sensitive" and can postpone dealing with them till last, but occasionally one you didn't know about will pop up early on. The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value already tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions with them.  

理想情况下，你知道哪些投资者有 "估值敏感 "的名声，可以将与他们打交道推迟到最后，但偶尔会有一个你不知道的投资者在早期就出现了。在这种情况下，按预期价值加权进行广度搜索的规则已经告诉你该怎么做：放慢你与他们的互动。

There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower valuation even when your price has already been set.  

有少数投资者会试图以较低的估值进行投资，即使你的价格已经确定。  

Lowering your price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you've let the price get set too high to close all the money you need.  

降低价格是当你发现你让价格定得太高，无法成交你所需要的所有资金时，你所采取的一个备用计划。  

So you'd only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about to do that anyway.  

因此，只有当你准备这样做的时候，你才会想和这种投资者交谈。  

But since investor meetings have to be arranged at least a few days in advance and you can't predict when you'll need to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that you should approach this type of investor last if at all.  

但是，由于投资者会议必须至少提前几天安排，而且你无法预测你何时需要诉诸于降低价格，这意味着在实践中，如果有的话，你应该最后才接触这类投资者。

If you're surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer and delay responding to it.  

如果你对一个低价的报价感到惊讶，把它当作一个备用报价，并推迟对它的回应。  

When someone makes an offer in good faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time. But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the corresponding countermove.  

当有人真诚地提出报价时，你有道义上的义务在合理的时间内作出回应。但是，低价收购你是一个混蛋行为，应该得到相应的反击。

**Accept offers greedily.  

贪婪地接受报价。**

I'm a little leery of using the term "greedily" when writing about fundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy algorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look into the future. A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it right now.  

在写关于筹款的文章时，我有点害怕使用 "贪婪地 "这个词，以免非程序员误解我，但贪婪的算法只是一个不试图看向未来的算法。一个贪婪的算法会选择它现在面前的最佳选择。  

And that is how startups should approach fundraising in phases 2 and later.  

而这正是初创企业在第二阶段及以后阶段应该采取的筹款方式。  

Don't try to look into the future because (a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're often being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority in fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work anyway.  

不要试图展望未来，因为（a）未来是不可预测的，事实上在这个行业中，你经常被故意误导；（b）无论如何，你在筹款中的首要任务应该是完成它，然后回去工作。

If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it. If you have multiple incompatible offers, take the best. Don't reject an acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.  

如果有人给你一个可接受的报价，就接受它。如果你有多个不兼容的报价，就接受最好的。不要拒绝一个可以接受的报价，希望将来能得到一个更好的报价。

These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases. If you're raising money from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  

这些简单的规则涵盖了各种各样的情况。如果你从许多投资者那里筹集资金，在他们说好的时候把他们卷起来。  

As you start to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for acceptable will start to get higher.  

当你开始觉得你已经筹集到足够的资金时，可接受的门槛将开始变得更高。

In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points. So when you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with others (e.g.  

在实践中，报价存在于时间段，而不是点。因此，当你得到一个可接受的报价时，会与其他报价不相容（如  

an offer to invest most of the money you need), you can tell the other investors you're talking to that you have an offer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their own.  

一个投资你所需要的大部分资金的提议），你可以告诉与你交谈的其他投资者，你有一个足够好的提议可以接受，并给他们几天时间来提出自己的提议。  

This could lose you some that might have made an offer if they had more time. But by definition you don't care; the initial offer was acceptable.  

这可能会让你失去一些如果他们有更多时间可能会提出的报价。但根据定义，你并不关心；最初的报价是可以接受的。

Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide by giving you an "exploding" offer, meaning one that's only valid for a few days.  

一些投资者会试图通过给你一个 "爆炸性 "的报价，即只在几天内有效的报价，来阻止其他人有时间做决定。  

Offers from the very best investors explode less frequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding offers, for example — because they're confident you'll pick them.  

最好的投资者的报价不那么频繁，也不那么迅速--例如，弗雷德-威尔逊从不给出爆炸性报价--因为他们相信你会选择它们。  

But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would choose them. A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  

但是，低层次的投资者有时会给出保险丝很短的报价，因为他们认为没有人在有其他选择的情况下会选择他们。三个工作日的期限是可以接受的。  

You shouldn't need more than that if you've been talking to investors in parallel. But a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing with a sketchy investor.  

如果你一直在与投资者并行交谈，你不应该需要更多的时间。但是，如果期限再短，就表明你在和一个不可靠的投资者打交道。  

You can usually call their bluff, and you may need to. \[[22](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f22n)\]  

你通常可以叫他们虚张声势，而且你可能需要这样做。\[22\]

It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal should be to get the best investors as partners.  

看起来，与其贪婪地接受报价，你的目标应该是让最好的投资者成为合作伙伴。  

That is certainly a good goal, but in phase 2 "get the best investors" only rarely conflicts with "accept offers greedily," because the best investors don't usually take any longer to decide than the others.  

这当然是一个很好的目标，但在第二阶段，"获得最好的投资者 "只是很少与 "贪婪地接受报价 "相冲突，因为最好的投资者通常不会比其他人花更多时间来决定。  

The only case where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you'll get an offer from a better one.  

这两种策略所提供的建议相互冲突的唯一情况是，你必须放弃一个可接受的投资者的报价，以看看你是否会得到一个更好的投资者的报价。  

If you talk to investors in parallel and push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines, that will almost never happen.  

如果你与投资者并行交谈，并以过短的最后期限推回爆炸性的报价，这几乎永远不会发生。  

But if it does, "get the best investors" is in the average case bad advice.  

但如果是这样，"找最好的投资者 "在一般情况下是不好的建议。  

The best investors are also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the startups.  

最好的投资者也是最有选择性的，因为他们可以从所有的初创企业中挑选。  

They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means in the average case it's a bad trade to exchange a definite offer from an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better one.  

他们几乎拒绝了所有与他们交谈的人，这意味着在一般情况下，用一个可接受的投资者的明确报价换取一个更好的投资者的潜在报价，是一个糟糕的交易。

(The situation is different in phase 1. You can't apply to all the incubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to prevent this.  

(第一阶段的情况有所不同。你不能同时申请所有的孵化器，因为有些孵化器会抵消它们的时间表以防止这种情况。  

In phase 1, "accept offers greedily" and "get the best investors" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple incubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want most decide first.)  

在第一阶段，"贪婪地接受报价 "和 "获得最好的投资者 "确实有冲突，所以如果你想申请多个孵化器，你应该这样做，让你最想要的人先决定。）

Sometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a series A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules even cover what to do in that case.  

有时，当你从多个投资者那里筹集资金时，A系列会在这些对话中出现，这些规则甚至包括在这种情况下该怎么做。  

When an investor starts to talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till they actually give you a termsheet.  

当一个投资者开始和你谈A轮投资时，继续接受较小的投资，直到他们真正给你一个条款表。  

There's no practical difficulty. If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they'll just convert into the series A round.  

这没有什么实际困难。如果较小的投资是在可转换票据上，它们会直接转换为A轮投资。  

The series A investor won't like having all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it bothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet. Till they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy algorithm tells you what to do. \[[23](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f23n)\]  

A系列的投资者不会喜欢有所有这些随机的投资者作为伙伴，但如果这让他们如此困扰，他们应该继续给你一个条款表。在他们这样做之前，你不确定他们会这样做，而贪婪的算法告诉你该怎么做。\[23\]

**Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.  

第二阶段的销售量不要超过25%。**

If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually. I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds. Startups may start to skip them.  

如果你做得好，你最终可能会筹集到A轮融资。我说可能是因为A轮融资的情况正在发生变化。初创企业可能开始跳过它们。  

But only one company we've funded has so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through an A round. \[[24](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f24n)\]  

但到目前为止，我们只资助了一家公司，所以暂且认为通往巨大的道路要通过A轮融资。\[24\]

Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that will mess up raising an A round.  

这意味着你应该避免在早期回合中做一些会搞砸提高A回合的事情。  

For example, if you've sold more than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock left to keep the founders motivated.  

例如，如果你卖出的股票超过了公司总额的40%，就开始难以筹集到A轮资金，因为风险投资公司担心会没有足够的股票来保持创始人的积极性。

Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top of whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  

我们的经验法则是，在第一阶段卖出的东西的基础上，第二阶段的销售量不要超过25%，而第一阶段的销售量应该低于15%。  

If you're raising money on uncapped notes, you'll have to guess what the eventual equity round valuation might be. Guess conservatively.  

如果你用无上限的票据筹资，你将不得不猜测最终的股权回合估值可能是多少。保守地猜测。

(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A, there's obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in phase 2, as a handful of startups do.)  

(由于这条规则的目的是为了避免搞砸A轮融资，如果你最终在第二阶段筹集A轮融资，显然有一个例外，就像少数创业公司所做的那样）。

**Have one person handle fundraising.  

让一个人负责筹款。**

If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so the other(s) can keep working on the company.  

如果你有多个创始人，选择一个人处理筹款，这样其他的人就可以继续为公司工作。  

And since the danger of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles fundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other founder(s) from the details of the process. \[[25](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f25n)\]  

而且，由于筹款的危险不在于实际会议所占用的时间，而在于它成为你头脑中最重要的想法，所以负责筹款的创始人应该有意识地努力使其他创始人与筹款过程的细节隔绝。\[25\]

(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction. But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems to worry about than how to organize fundraising.)  

(如果创始人之间相互不信任，这可能会引起一些摩擦。但是，如果创始人相互不信任，你有比如何组织筹款更糟糕的问题需要担心）。

The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should in turn be the most formidable of the founders. Even if the CEO is a programmer and another founder is a salesperson? Yes.  

处理筹款的创始人应该是首席执行官，而首席执行官又应该是创始人中最厉害的人。即使CEO是一个程序员，而另一个创始人是一个销售人员？是的。  

If you happen to be that type of founding team, you're effectively a single founder when it comes to fundraising.  

如果你碰巧是这种类型的创始团队，那么在筹款方面，你实际上是一个单一的创始人。

It's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will invest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before deciding. But wait till that point.  

带上所有的创始人去见一个将大量投资的投资者是可以的，他需要这次会议作为决定前的最后一步。但要等到这一步。  

Introducing an investor to your cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to your parents — something you do only when things reach a certain stage of seriousness.  

把投资者介绍给你的联合创始人应该像把女孩/男朋友介绍给你的父母一样--只有当事情发展到一定的严肃阶段，你才会这样做。

Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company during fundraising, growth will slow.  

即使在筹款期间仍有一个或多个创始人专注于公司，增长也会放缓。  

But try to get as much growth as you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point, and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome. If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings, investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or down they'll start to get cold feet.  

但要尽量获得更多的增长，因为筹款是一段时间，而不是一个点，公司在这段时间内发生的事情会影响结果。如果你的数字在两次投资者会议之间大幅增长，投资者就会热衷于成交，如果你的数字持平或下降，他们就会开始冷淡。

**You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.  

你将需要一个执行摘要和（也许）一个甲板。**

Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide deck in person to investors. Sequoia describes what such a deck should [contain](http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas), and since they're the customer you can take their word for it.  

传统上，第二阶段的筹款包括亲自向投资者展示幻灯片。红杉描述了这样的幻灯片应该包含哪些内容，由于他们是客户，你可以相信他们的话。

I say "traditionally" because I'm ambivalent about decks, and (though perhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out. A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in phase 2. They just talk to investors and explain what they plan to do.  

我说 "传统上 "是因为我对甲板很矛盾，而且（尽管这可能是一厢情愿的想法）它们似乎正在被淘汰。我们资助的许多最成功的初创企业在第二阶段从未制作过宣传材料。他们只是与投资者交谈，解释他们的计划。  

Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that are most successful at it, and they're thus able to excuse themselves by saying that they haven't had time to make a deck.  

对于那些在这方面最成功的初创企业来说，筹款通常起步很快，因此他们能够以没有时间制作牌子来为自己辩护。

You'll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than a page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what you plan to do, why it's a good idea, and what progress you've made so far.  

你还需要一份执行摘要，长度不超过一页，用最朴实的语言描述你打算做什么，为什么这是一个好主意，以及到目前为止你已经取得了哪些进展。  

The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who may have met many startups that day) what you talked about.  

摘要的意义在于提醒投资者（他可能在那天遇到了许多初创企业）你所谈到的内容。

Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive summary, it will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have it.  

假设你给别人一份你的牌子或执行摘要的副本，它将被传递给你最不希望得到的人。  

But don't refuse on that account to give copies to investors you meet. You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing business. In practice it's not that high a cost.  

但不要因此而拒绝向你遇到的投资者提供副本。你只需要把这种泄漏当作做生意的成本。在实践中，这并不是一个很高的成本。  

Though founders are rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors, I can't think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.  

尽管创始人在他们的计划被泄露给竞争对手时理所当然地感到愤慨，但我想不出有哪家创业公司的结果受到了影响。

Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you. I wouldn't do that. It's a sign they're not really interested.  

有时，投资者会要求你在决定是否与你见面之前，将你的甲板和/或执行摘要发给他们。我不会这么做。这是一个他们并不真正感兴趣的信号。

**Stop fundraising when it stops working.  

当它停止工作时，停止筹款。**

When do you stop fundraising? Ideally when you've raised enough. But what if you haven't raised as much as you'd like? When do you give up?  

你什么时候停止筹款？理想的情况是当你筹集到足够的资金时。但是，如果你没有筹集到你想要的那么多，怎么办？你什么时候放弃？

It's hard to give general advice about this, because there have been cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when it seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded.  

对此很难给出一般性的建议，因为有一些初创企业即使在看起来没有希望的情况下也一直在努力筹集资金，并奇迹般地获得成功。  

But what I usually tell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot of air in the straw.  

但我通常告诉创始人的是，当你开始在吸管中获得大量空气时，要停止筹款。  

When you're drinking through a straw, you can tell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get a lot of air in the straw.  

当你用吸管喝水时，你可以告诉你什么时候到了液体的尽头，因为你开始在吸管中得到大量的空气。  

When your fundraising options run out, they usually run out in the same way. Don't keep sucking on the straw if you're just getting air. It's not going to get better.  

当你的筹款选择用完后，通常以同样的方式用完。如果你只是得到空气，就不要继续吸吮吸管。它不会变得更好。

**Don't get addicted to fundraising.  

不要对筹款上瘾。**

Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more interesting than working on their startup. The work at an early stage startup often consists of unglamorous [schleps](http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html). Whereas fundraising, when it's going well, can be quite the opposite.  

对大多数创始人来说，筹款是一件苦差事，但有些人发现它比在创业公司工作更有趣。早期阶段的创业公司的工作往往包括不光彩的琐事。而筹款，当它进展顺利时，可以是完全相反的。  

Instead of sitting in your grubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your software, you're being offered millions of dollars by famous investors over lunch at a nice restaurant. \[[26](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f26n)\]  

你不是坐在你肮脏的公寓里听用户抱怨你的软件中的错误，而是在一家漂亮的餐厅吃午饭时被著名的投资者提供数百万美元。\[26\]

The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are good at it. It's always fun to work on something you're good at. If you're one of these people, beware.  

对于擅长筹款的人来说，筹款的危险尤其严重。在你擅长的事情上工作总是很有趣。如果你是这些人中的一员，请小心。  

Fundraising is not what will make your company successful. Listening to users complain about bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  

筹款不是使你的公司成功的原因。听取用户对你的软件中的错误的抱怨才会使你成功。  

And the big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely that you'll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  

而沉迷于筹款的最大危险不仅仅是你会在筹款上花费太长的时间或筹集太多资金。  

It's that you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful, and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually be successful. Startups can be destroyed by this.  

就是你会开始认为自己已经成功了，而对你为真正成功而需要承担的琐事失去兴趣。初创企业会因此而被摧毁。

When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful at fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability that they'll succeed.  

当我看到一个由年轻创始人组成的创业公司在筹款方面取得了惊人的成功时，我在心理上减少了对他们成功的概率的估计。  

The press may be writing about them as if they'd been anointed as the next Google, but I'm thinking "this is going to end badly."  

媒体可能会把他们写得像被任命为下一个谷歌一样，但我在想 "这将会是一个糟糕的结局"。

**Don't raise too much.  

不要提高太多。**

Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is possible to raise too much. The dangers of raising too much are subtle but insidious.  

虽然只有少数初创企业需要担心这个问题，但也有可能筹集到过多的资金。筹集太多资金的危险是微妙的，但也是隐蔽的。  

One is that it will set impossibly high expectations.  

一个是它将设定不可能的高期望值。  

If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will be at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high a valuation is that you won't be able to increase it sufficiently the next time you raise money.  

如果你筹集了过多的资金，那么它的估值就会很高，而在太高的估值下筹集资金的危险在于，你在下一次筹集资金时无法充分地提高它。

A company's valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money. If not it's a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you unattractive to investors.  

一家公司的估值预计会在每次融资时上升。如果不是这样，那就是一个公司陷入困境的标志，这让你对投资者没有吸引力。  

So if you raise money in phase 2 at a post-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of your next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be at least $50 million.  

因此，如果你在第二阶段以3000万美元的投后估值筹集资金，那么你下一轮的投前估值，如果你想筹集资金，至少要达到5000万美元。  

And you have to be doing really, really well to raise money at $50 million.  

而且你必须做得非常非常好，才能筹集到5000万美元的资金。

It's very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round set the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next one, because the two are only loosely coupled.  

让你当前回合的竞争力设定你必须达到的性能门槛以提高你的下一个回合，这是非常危险的，因为这两者只是松散的耦合。

But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation. The more you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can be disastrous for an early stage startup.  

但钱本身可能比估值更危险。你筹集的资金越多，你花的钱就越多，而花大量的钱对一个早期的创业公司来说可能是灾难性的。  

Spending a lot makes it harder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you more rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the more people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  

花钱多会使你更难盈利，也许更糟糕的是，它会使你更僵化，因为花钱的主要方式是人，你的人越多，就越难改变方向。  

So if you do raise a huge amount of money, don't spend it.  

因此，如果你确实筹集到了巨额资金，不要花掉它。  

(You will find that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the money burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least to try.)  

(你会发现这个建议几乎不可能被遵守，所以热钱会在你的口袋里烧一个洞，但我觉得至少有义务尝试一下）。

**Be nice.**

Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming arrogant.  

筹集资金的初创企业偶尔会因为看起来很傲慢而疏远投资者。  

Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because they're noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they've observed in experienced founders.  

有时是因为他们很傲慢，有时是因为他们是新手，笨拙地试图模仿他们在有经验的创始人身上看到的强硬态度。

It's a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  

对投资者表现得傲慢无礼是个错误。  

While there are certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds of arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick of the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with indignation.  

虽然在某些情况下，某些投资者喜欢某种傲慢的态度，但投资者在这方面差别很大，一甩鞭子，让一个人乖乖听话，就会让另一个人愤愤不平地吼叫。  

The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at all.  

唯一安全的策略是根本不要显得傲慢。

That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I've given here, because the advice I've given is essentially how to play hardball back.  

如果你遵循我在这里给出的建议，这将需要一些外交手段，因为我给出的建议本质上是如何打回硬仗。  

When you refuse to meet an investor because you're not in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an investor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no it actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving that investor out, you're going to be doing things investors don't like.  

当你因为不在筹款状态而拒绝与投资者见面，或放慢与行动太慢的投资者的互动，或把一个或有的报价当作实际上的 "不"，然后通过贪婪地接受报价，最终将该投资者排除在外，你将会做投资者不喜欢的事情。  

So you must cushion the blow with soft words. At YC we tell startups they can blame us. And now that I've written this, everyone else can blame me if they want.  

所以你必须用柔和的语言来缓冲打击。在YC，我们告诉创业公司他们可以责备我们。现在我写了这个，如果其他人愿意，也可以责备我。  

That plus the inexperience card should work in most situations: sorry, we think you're great, but PG said startups shouldn't \_\_\_, and since we're new to fundraising, we feel like we have to play it safe.  

这一点加上经验不足这张牌在大多数情况下应该是有效的：对不起，我们认为你很好，但PG说初创公司不应该\_\_，由于我们是筹款新手，我们觉得我们必须玩得安全。

The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you're doing well. When everyone wants you, it's hard not to let it go to your head. Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  

当你做得好的时候，行为傲慢的危险是最大的。当每个人都想要你的时候，你很难不让它进入你的头脑。特别是如果直到最近还没有人想要你。  

But restrain yourself. The startup world is a small place, and startups have lots of ups and downs. This is a domain where it's more true than usual that pride goeth before a fall. \[[27](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html#f27n)\]  

但要克制自己。创业公司的世界是一个小地方，创业公司有很多起伏。在这个领域中，骄傲自满的人比一般人更有道理。\[27\]

Be nice when investors reject you as well. The best investors are not wedded to their initial opinion of you. If they reject you in phase 2 and you end up doing well, they'll often invest in phase 3. In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads for future fundraising.  

当投资者拒绝你时，也要态度好一点。最好的投资者不会拘泥于他们对你的最初看法。如果他们在第二阶段拒绝你，而你最终做得很好，他们往往会在第三阶段投资。事实上，那些拒绝你的投资者是你未来筹款的一些最温暖的线索。  

Any investor who spent significant time deciding probably came close to saying yes. Often you have some internal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince the skeptics.  

任何花了大量时间决定的投资者可能都接近于说 "是 "了。通常情况下，你有一些内部支持者，他们只需要多一点证据来说服怀疑者。  

So it's wise not merely to be nice to investors who reject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the beginning of a relationship.  

因此，明智的做法是不只是对拒绝你的投资者好，而是（除非他们表现得很糟糕）把它当作关系的开始。

**The bar will be higher next time.  

下次的标准会更高。**

Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever raise. You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.  

假设你在第二阶段筹集的资金将是你最后筹集的资金。如果可以的话，你必须靠这笔钱来实现盈利。

Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved from a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and then supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at early stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next stage.  

在过去的几年里，投资界已经从早期指定少数赢家，然后支持他们多年的策略演变为向早期阶段的初创企业喷洒资金，然后在下一个阶段无情地剔除它们。  

This is probably the optimal strategy for investors. It's too hard to pick winners early on. Better to let the market do it for you.  

这可能是投资者的最佳策略。在早期挑选赢家太难了。最好让市场为你做这件事。  

But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much harder it is to raise money in phase 3.  

但对于初创企业来说，在第三阶段融资有多难，往往让人感到惊讶。

When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns out.  

当你的公司只有几个月的历史时，它必须是一个有前途的实验，值得资助，看看它的结果如何。  

The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have worked.  

下次你筹集资金时，这个实验必须成功。  

You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public. And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment worked might consist of e.g.  

你必须要有一个导致上市的轨迹。虽然有一些想法，证明实验成功的方法可能包括，例如  

query response times, usually the proof is profitability. Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A fundraising.  

查询响应时间，通常证明是盈利的。通常第三阶段的筹款必须是A类筹款。

In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between phases 2 and 3. Some are just too slow to become profitable. They raise enough money to last for two years.  

在实践中，有两种方法使初创企业在第二和第三阶段之间自生自灭。有些公司只是速度太慢，无法实现盈利。他们筹集足够的资金来维持两年的时间。  

There doesn't seem any particular urgency to be profitable. So they don't make any effort to make money for a year. But by that time, not making money has become habitual.  

似乎没有任何特别的紧迫感，需要盈利。所以他们在一年内不努力赚钱。但是到了那个时候，不赚钱已经成为习惯了。  

When they finally decide to try, they find they can't.  

当他们最终决定尝试时，他们发现他们无法做到。

The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses grow too fast.  

公司管自己的另一种方式是让他们的开支增长过快。  

Which almost always means hiring too many people. You usually shouldn't go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise money at phase 2. Usually you want to wait till you have growth (and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  

这几乎总是意味着雇佣了太多的人。你通常不应该在第二阶段一筹到钱就去雇佣8个人。通常情况下，你想等到你有了增长（因此通常是收入），才能证明他们是合理的。  

A lot of VCs will encourage you to hire aggressively.  

很多风险投资公司会鼓励你积极地招聘。  

VCs generally tell you to spend too much, partly because as money people they err on the side of solving problems by spending money, and partly because they want you to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  

风险投资公司通常会告诉你要花太多钱，部分原因是作为有钱人，他们偏向于通过花钱来解决问题，部分原因是他们希望你在随后的几轮融资中向他们出售更多的公司股权。  

Don't listen to them.  

不要听他们的。

**Don't make things complicated.  

不要让事情变得复杂。**

I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying that my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated, but if you go back and look at this list you'll see it's basically a simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  

我意识到，用 "我的总体建议是不要把筹款搞得太复杂 "来总结这篇庞大的论文可能显得很奇怪，但如果你回头看看这份清单，你会发现它基本上是一个有很多含义和边缘情况的简单配方。  

Avoid investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do, talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and accept offers greedily. That's fundraising in one sentence.  

在你决定筹集资金之前，避开投资者，然后当你决定筹集资金时，与他们同时交谈，按预期价值优先考虑，并贪婪地接受报价。这就是筹款的一句话。  

Don't introduce complicated optimizations, and don't let investors introduce complications either.  

不要引入复杂的优化，也不要让投资者引入复杂的优化。

Fundraising is not what will make you successful. It's just a means to an end.  

筹款不是使你成功的原因。它只是达到目的的一种手段。  

Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get back to what will make you successful — making things and talking to users — and the path I've described will for most startups be the surest way to that destination.  

你的首要目标应该是解决这个问题，回到使你成功的领域--制造东西和与用户交谈--而我所描述的路径对大多数初创企业来说是通向这个目的地的最可靠途径。

Be good, take care of yourselves, and _don't leave the path_.  

做好自己，照顾好自己，不要离开这条路。

**Notes**

\[1\] The worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups encounter mediocre investors. Good investors don't lead startups on; their reputations are too valuable.  

\[1\] 最糟糕的爆炸发生在看起来没有前途的初创企业遇到平庸的投资者时。好的投资者不会带领初创企业继续前进；他们的声誉太宝贵了。  

And startups that seem promising can usually get enough money from good investors that they don't have to talk to mediocre ones.  

而那些看起来很有前途的初创企业通常可以从优秀的投资者那里获得足够的资金，他们不必与平庸的投资者交谈。  

It is the unpromising-seeming startups that have to resort to raising money from mediocre investors. And it's particularly damaging when these investors flake, because unpromising-seeming startups are usually more desperate for money.  

正是那些看起来没有前途的初创企业，不得不求助于平庸的投资者来筹集资金。而当这些投资者退出时，它的危害性尤其大，因为看起来没有前途的初创企业通常更渴望得到钱。

(并非所有看起来没有前途的初创企业都做得很糟糕。有些只是丑小鸭，因为它们违反了当前的创业时尚）。

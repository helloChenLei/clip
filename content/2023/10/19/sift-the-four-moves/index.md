How can students get better at sorting truth from fiction from everything in between?  

学生如何才能更好地分辨真假？  

At applying their attention to the things that matter?  

把注意力放在重要的事情上？  

At amplifying better treatments of issues, and avoiding clickbait?  

如何更好地处理问题，避免点击式宣传？

Since 2017, we’ve been teaching students with something called the Four Moves.  

从 2017 年起，我们开始用一种叫做 "四招 "的东西来教学生。

Our solution is to give students and others a short list of _things to do_ when looking at a source, and hook each of those things to one or two highly effective web techniques.  

我们的解决方案是给学生和其他人提供一份简短的清单，列出在查看资料时要做的事情，并将每件事情与一两个高效的网络技术挂钩。  

We call the “things to do” _moves_ and there are four of them:  

我们称之为 "要做的事情"，共有四项：

The four moves: Stop, Investigate the source, find better coverage, trace the original context.  

这四招停止、调查来源、寻找更好的报道、追溯原委。

### Stop  

停止

The first move is the simplest. **STOP** reminds you of two things.  

第一招最简单。STOP 提醒你两件事。

First, when you first hit a page or post and start to read it — STOP.  

首先，当你第一次点击一个页面或帖子并开始阅读时--停止。  

Ask yourself whether you know the website or source of the information, and what the reputation of both the claim and the website is.  

问问自己是否了解网站或信息来源，以及索赔和网站的声誉如何。  

If you don’t have that information, use the other moves to get a sense of what you’re looking at.  

如果您没有这些信息，请使用其他动作来了解您正在查看的内容。  

Don’t read it or share media until you know what it is.  

在了解它是什么之前，不要阅读或分享媒体。

Second, after you begin to use the other moves it can be easy to go down a rabbit hole, going off on tangents only distantly related to your original task.  

其次，当你开始使用其他招式后，很容易就会走入兔子洞，偏离与你最初任务关系不大的切入点。  

If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed in your fact-checking efforts, STOP and take a second to remember your purpose.  

如果您在事实核查工作中感到力不从心，请停下来，花点时间回忆一下您的目的。  

If you just want to repost, read an interesting story, or get a high-level explanation of a concept, it’s probably good enough to find out whether the publication is reputable.  

如果你只是想转发、阅读一个有趣的故事或获得一个概念的高层次解释，那么了解一下该出版物是否有信誉就足够了。  

If you are doing deep research of your own, you may want to chase down individual claims in a newspaper article and independently verify them.  

如果您自己正在进行深入研究，您可能需要追寻报纸文章中的个别说法，并对其进行独立核实。

Please keep in mind that both sorts of investigations are equally useful.  

请记住，这两种调查同样有用。  

Quick and shallow investigations will form most of what we do on the web.  

快速而浅显的调查将构成我们在网络上的大部分工作。  

We get quicker with the simple stuff in part so we can spend more time on the stuff that matters to us.  

我们能更快地处理简单的事情，部分原因是我们可以把更多的时间花在对我们重要的事情上。  

But in either case, stopping periodically and reevaluating our reaction or search strategy is key.  

但无论哪种情况，定期停下来重新评估我们的反应或搜索策略都是关键。

### Investigate the source  

调查来源

We’ll go into this move more on the next page. But idea here is that you want to know _what_ you’re reading _before_ you read it.  

我们将在下一页详细介绍这一步骤。但这里的意思是，在阅读之前，你要知道自己在读什么。

Now, you don’t have to do a Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into a source before you engage with it.  

现在，你不必先对消息来源进行普利策获奖调查，然后再与之接触。  

But if you’re reading a piece on economics by a Nobel prize-winning economist, you should know that before you read it.  

但是，如果你读的是一篇由诺贝尔经济学奖得主撰写的经济学文章，那么你在读之前就应该知道这一点。  

Conversely, if you’re watching a video on the many benefits of milk consumption that was put out by the dairy industry, you want to know that as well.  

反之，如果您正在观看由乳制品行业推出的关于饮用牛奶的诸多益处的视频，您也想知道这一点。

This doesn’t mean the Nobel economist will always be right and that the dairy industry can’t be trusted.  

这并不意味着诺贝尔经济学家永远是对的，也不意味着乳制品行业不可信。  

But knowing the expertise and agenda of the source is crucial to your interpretation of what they say.  

但是，了解消息来源的专业知识和议程对你解读他们的言论至关重要。  

Taking sixty seconds to figure out where media is from before reading will help you decide if it is worth your time, and if it is, help you to better understand its significance and trustworthiness.  

在阅读之前，花六十秒钟搞清楚媒体的来源，将有助于你决定是否值得花时间阅读，如果值得，还有助于你更好地理解其意义和可信度。

### Find better coverage  

寻找更好的覆盖范围

Sometimes you don’t care about the particular article or video that reaches you. You care about the _claim_ the article is making. You want to know if it is true or false.  

有时，你并不关心到达你面前的特定文章或视频。你关心的是文章提出的主张。你想知道它是真是假。  

You want to know if it represents a consensus viewpoint, or if it is the subject of much disagreement.  

你想知道它是代表了一种共识，还是存在很多分歧。

In this case, your best strategy may be to ignore the source that reached you, and look for trusted reporting or analysis on the claim.  

在这种情况下，你的最佳策略可能是忽略向你提供信息的来源，并寻找可信的报道或分析。  

If you get an article that says koalas have just been declared extinct from the Save the Koalas Foundation, your best bet might not be to investigate the source, but to go out and find the _best_ source you can on this topic, or, just as importantly, to scan multiple sources and see what the expert consensus seems to be.  

如果你从拯救考拉基金会收到一篇文章，说考拉刚刚被宣布灭绝，你最好的办法可能不是去调查消息来源，而是去寻找关于这个话题的最好的消息来源，或者，同样重要的是，扫描多个消息来源，看看专家们似乎达成了什么共识。  

In these cases we encourage you to “find other coverage” that better suits your needs — more trusted, more in-depth, or maybe just more varied.  

在这种情况下，我们鼓励您 "寻找其他更适合您需求的保险"--更可信、更深入，或者只是更多样化。  

In lesson two we’ll show you some techniques to do this sort of thing very quickly.  

在第二课中，我们将向你展示一些快速完成此类工作的技巧。

Do you have to agree with the consensus once you find it? Absolutely not!  

一旦达成共识，就一定要同意吗？当然不是！  

But understanding the context and history of a claim will help you better evaluate it and form a starting point for future investigation.  

但是，了解索赔的背景和历史将有助于您更好地评估索赔，并为今后的调查奠定基础。

### Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context  

追溯声明、引文和媒体的原始语境

Much of what we find on the internet has been stripped of context.  

我们在互联网上找到的大部分内容都被剥离了背景。  

Maybe there’s a video of a fight between two people with Person A as the aggressor.  

也许有一段两个人打架的视频，A 君是攻击者。  

But what happened before that? What was clipped out of the video and what stayed in?  

但在此之前发生了什么？视频中哪些内容被剪掉了，哪些内容保留了下来？  

Maybe there’s a picture that seems real but the caption could be misleading.  

也许有一张看似真实的照片，但标题可能会误导人。  

Maybe a claim is made about a new medical treatment based on a research finding — but you’re not certain if the cited research paper really said that.  

也许有人根据研究结果提出了一种新的医疗方法，但你不确定引用的研究论文是否真的是这样说的。

In these cases we’ll have you trace the claim, quote, or media back to the source, so you can see it in it’s original context and get a sense if the version you saw was accurately presented.  

在这种情况下，我们会让您追溯到声明、引语或媒体的来源，这样您就可以看到它的原始语境，并了解您看到的版本是否准确。

### It’s about REcontextualizing  

要重新构建语境

There’s a theme that runs through all of these moves: they are about reconstructing the necessary context to read, view, or listen to digital content effectively.  

所有这些举措都贯穿着一个主题：它们都是为了重建必要的语境，以便有效地阅读、查看或聆听数字内容。

One piece of context is who the speaker or publisher is. What’s their expertise? What’s their agenda?  

背景之一是演讲者或出版商是谁。他们的专长是什么？他们的议程是什么？  

What’s their record of fairness or accuracy? So we investigate the source.  

他们的公正性和准确性记录如何？因此，我们要调查消息来源。  

Just as when you hear a rumor you want to know who the source is before reacting, when you encounter something on the web you need the same sort of context.  

当你听到谣言时，你希望在做出反应之前知道消息来源是谁，而当你在网络上遇到一些事情时，你也需要同样的背景信息。

When it comes to claims, a key piece of context includes whether they are broadly accepted or rejected or something in-between.  

说到索赔，一个关键的背景因素包括索赔是被广泛接受还是被拒绝，或者是介于两者之间。  

By scanning for other coverage you can see what the expert consensus is on a claim, learn the history around it, and ultimately land on a better source.  

通过扫描其他报道，您可以了解专家对某一索赔的共识，了解相关历史，最终找到更好的来源。

Finally, when evidence is presented with a certain frame — whether a quote or a video or a scientific finding — sometimes it helps to reconstruct the original context in which the photo was taken or research claim was made.  

最后，当证据与某一框架一起出现时--无论是引语、视频还是科学发现--有时有助于重构拍摄照片或提出研究主张的原始背景。  

It can look quite different in context!  

在上下文中，它可能看起来完全不同！

In some cases these techniques will show you claims are outright wrong, or that sources are legitimately “bad actors” who are trying to deceive you.  

在某些情况下，这些技术会让你发现自己的说法是完全错误的，或者信息来源是试图欺骗你的合法 "坏人"。  

But in the vast majority of cases they do something just as important: they reestablish the context that the web so often strips away, allowing for more fruitful engagement with all digital information.  

但在绝大多数情况下，它们做了同样重要的事情：它们重新建立了网络经常剥离的语境，让人们能够更富有成效地接触所有数字信息。

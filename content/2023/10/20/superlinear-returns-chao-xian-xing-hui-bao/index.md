![Superlinear Returns](superlinear-returns-1.gif)October 2023  

2023 年 10 月

One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear.

  

我小时候对这个世界不了解的最重要的事情之一，就是业绩回报的超线性程度。

Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. "You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They meant well, but this is rarely true.

  

老师和教练潜移默化地告诉我们，回报是线性的。"我听过无数次 "一分耕耘一分收获"他们的本意是好的，但事实很少如此。  

If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.  

如果你的产品只有竞争对手产品的一半好，你就得不到一半的客户。没有客户，你就会倒闭。

It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business.

  

在商业领域，业绩回报显然是超线性的。  

Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true.  

有些人认为这是资本主义的缺陷，如果我们改变规则，这就不再是事实了。  

But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented.  

但是，超线性业绩回报是这个世界的特征，而不是我们发明的规则的产物。  

We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity.  

我们在名誉、权力、军事胜利、知识甚至造福人类方面都能看到同样的模式。  

In all of these, the rich get richer. \[[1](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f1n)\]  

在所有这些情况中，富者愈富。\[1\]

You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns.

  

不理解超线性回报的概念，就无法理解这个世界。  

And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.  

如果你雄心勃勃，就一定要这样做，因为这将是你冲浪的浪头。

It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.

  

看起来似乎有很多不同的超线性回报情况，但就我所知，它们归结为两个基本原因：指数增长和临界点。

The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially.

  

超线性回报最明显的情况是，你正在研究的东西呈指数增长。  

For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially.  

例如，培养细菌。当它们生长时，它们会呈指数增长。  

But they're tricky to grow.  

但它们的生长很棘手。  

Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.  

这意味着，善于和不善于的人在结果上的差别是非常大的。

Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there.

  

初创企业也可以呈指数级增长，我们看到了同样的模式。  

Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't.  

有些人设法实现了高增长率。大多数则没有。  

And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.  

因此，你会得到截然不同的结果：增长率高的公司往往会变得非常有价值，而增长率低的公司甚至可能无法生存。

Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers.

  

Y Combinator 鼓励创始人关注增长率，而不是绝对数字。  

It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low.  

这可以防止他们在绝对数字还很低的时候就灰心丧气。  

It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company.  

它还能帮助他们决定重点关注什么：您可以将增长率作为指南针，告诉您如何发展公司。  

But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.  

但主要优势在于，通过关注增长率，你往往能获得指数级增长的东西。

YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate "you get out what you put in," but it's not far from the truth.

  

YC 并没有明确告诉创始人，对于增长率，"投入多少，就会有多少回报"，但事实并非如此。  

And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance _p_ over time _t_ would be proportional to _p<sup>t</sup>_.  

而如果增长率与业绩成正比，那么长期业绩 p 的奖励就会与 p 成正比。

Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling.

  

即使思考了几十年，我还是觉得这句话令人震惊。

Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth.

  

每当你做得如何取决于你已经做得如何时，你就会获得指数级增长。  

But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it.  

但是，我们的基因和习俗都没有让我们做好准备。  

No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.  

没有人认为指数式增长是自然现象；每个孩子第一次听到这个故事时都会感到惊讶：一个人第一天向国王要一粒米，第二天要双倍的米。

What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have.

  

我们不理解的东西自然会形成习俗来处理，但我们也没有很多关于指数增长的习俗，因为在人类历史上这种情况太少了。原则上，畜牧业应该是这样的：你拥有的动物越多，它们的后代也就越多。  

But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.  

但实际上，牧场是限制因素，而且没有计划让牧场成倍增长。

Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There _was_ a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest.

  

或者更确切地说，没有普遍适用的计划。有一种方法可以让自己的领土成倍增长：征服。  

The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory.  

您控制的领土越多，您的军队就越强大，征服新领土也就越容易。  

This is why history is full of empires.  

这就是历史上帝国林立的原因。  

But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much.  

但是，创造或经营帝国的人很少，他们的经历对习俗的影响并不大。  

The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life.  

皇帝是一个遥远而可怕的人物，不是一个可以用于自己生活的经验教训的来源。

The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship.

  

在前工业时代，最常见的指数增长可能是奖学金。  

The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things.  

了解得越多，学习新事物就越容易。  

The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics.  

结果，当时和现在一样，一些人在某些话题上的知识比其他人多得惊人。  

But this didn't affect customs much either.  

但这对海关的影响也不大。  

Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect. \[[2](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f2n)\]  

虽然思想帝国可以相互重叠，因而可以有更多的皇帝，但在前工业时代，这种帝国几乎没有什么实际作用。\[2\]

That has changed in the last few centuries.

  

在过去的几个世纪里，这种情况发生了变化。  

Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory.  

现在，"思想皇帝 "可以设计炸弹，打败 "领土皇帝"。  

But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it.  

但这一现象还很新，我们还没有完全消化吸收。  

Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.  

甚至很少有参与者意识到他们正受益于指数式增长，或询问他们能从其他实例中学到什么。

The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression "winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.

\[[3](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f3n)\]  

超线性回报的另一个来源体现在 "赢家通吃 "这一说法中。在体育比赛中，成绩与回报之间的关系是一个阶跃函数：获胜的球队无论表现得更好还是略胜一筹，都能获得一场胜利。\[3\]

The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome.

  

然而，阶跃函数的根源并不在于竞争本身。而是结果中存在门槛。  

You don't need competition to get those.  

你不需要通过竞争来获得这些。  

There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.  

在只有你一个人参与的情况下，比如证明一个定理或击中一个目标，可能会有门槛。

It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other.

  

令人注目的是，在有一种超线性回报来源的情况下，往往也会有另一种回报来源。  

Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future.  

越过阈值会导致指数增长：在战斗中获胜的一方通常受到的伤害较小，这使得他们在未来更有可能获胜。  

And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.  

指数级增长还能帮助你跨越门槛：在一个具有网络效应的市场中，增长足够快的公司可以将潜在的竞争对手拒之门外。

Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns.

  

成名是一个有趣的例子，它结合了超线性回报的两种来源。  

Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones.  

名气呈指数增长，因为现有粉丝会给你带来新的粉丝。  

But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head.  

但它如此集中的根本原因在于门槛：在普通人的头脑中，A 级名单的空间有限。

The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning.

  

结合两种超线性回报来源的最重要情况可能是学习。  

Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it.  

知识以指数形式增长，但也存在门槛。  

Learning to ride a bicycle, for example.  

比如学骑自行车。  

Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster.  

其中一些阈值类似于机床：一旦你学会了阅读，你就能更快地学习其他任何东西。  

But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries.  

但最重要的阈值是那些代表新发现的阈值。  

Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field.  

知识似乎是分形的，因为如果你在一个知识领域的边界上用力一推，有时就会发现一个全新的领域。  

And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it.  

如果你这样做了，你就能抢先获得所有新发现。  

Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.  

牛顿是这样做的，杜勒和达尔文也是这样做的。

Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns?

  

是否有发现超线性回报情况的一般规则？  

The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.  

最明显的一点就是寻找能产生复合效果的工作。

There are two ways work can compound.

  

工作有两种复合方式。  

It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next.  

它可以直接产生复合效应，即一个周期做得好，下一个周期就会做得更好。  

That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand.  

例如，在建设基础设施、扩大受众或品牌时，就会出现这种情况。  

Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds.  

或者说，工作可以通过教你而产生复合效果，因为学习可以产生复合效果。  

This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening.  

第二种情况很有趣，因为你可能会觉得自己做得很糟糕。  

You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal.  

您可能无法实现近期目标。  

But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.  

但如果你学到了很多东西，那么你还是会获得指数级的增长。

This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure.

  

这也是硅谷如此宽容失败的原因之一。  

People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure.  

硅谷人不会盲目容忍失败。  

They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures.  

只有当你从失败中吸取教训时，他们才会继续在你身上下注。  

But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.  

但如果你是这样，你其实是一个很好的赌注：也许你的公司没有按照你想要的方式发展，但你自己已经发展起来了，这最终应该会产生结果。

Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception.

  

事实上，不以学习为内容的指数增长形式往往与学习混杂在一起，我们或许应该将其视为常规而非例外。  

Which yields another heuristic: always be learning.  

这就产生了另一个启发式：永远学习。  

If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.  

如果你不学习，你可能就没有走上通往超线性回报的道路。

But don't overoptimize _what_ you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable.

  

但不要过度优化你正在学习的东西。不要局限于学习那些已知有价值的东西。  

You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.  

你正在学习，你还不确定什么是有价值的，如果你太严格，你就会砍掉异常值。

What about step functions?

  

阶跃功能如何？  

Are there also useful heuristics of the form "seek thresholds" or "seek competition?" Here the situation is trickier.  

是否还有 "寻求阈值 "或 "寻求竞争 "等形式的有用启发式方法？这里的情况比较棘手。  

The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing.  

门槛的存在并不能保证游戏值得一玩。  

If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off.  

如果你玩一轮俄罗斯轮盘赌，你的处境肯定会有一个临界点，但在最好的情况下，你的处境也不会好到哪里去。  

"Seek competition" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for?  

"寻求竞争 "同样没有用；如果奖品不值得竞争呢？  

Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape. \[[4](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f4n)\]  

足够快的指数增长既能保证收益曲线的形状，也能保证收益曲线的幅度--因为增长足够快的东西即使一开始很小，也会变得很大--但阈值只能保证形状。\[4\]

A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing.

  

利用门槛的原则必须包括一项测试，以确保游戏值得一玩。  

Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it.  

这里有一个办法：如果你遇到的东西很一般，但仍然很受欢迎，那么把它换掉可能是个好主意。  

For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one. \[[5](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f5n)\]  

例如，如果一家公司生产了一种人们不喜欢但仍然购买的产品，那么如果你生产了一种更好的替代品，想必他们也会购买。\[5\]

It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds.

  

如果有办法找到有前途的智力阈值，那就再好不过了。  

Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them?  

有什么方法可以分辨出哪些问题之外还有全新的领域？  

I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those.  

我怀疑我们是否能准确预测这一点，但该奖项价值连城，如果有比随机预测更好的预测指标，那将是非常有用的，而且我们有希望找到这样的预测指标。

We can to some degree predict when a research problem _isn't_ likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring.

  

在某种程度上，我们可以预测一个研究问题何时不会带来新发现：当它看起来合理但无聊时。  

Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant.  

而那些能带来新发现的人往往显得非常神秘，但也许并不重要。  

(If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to.  

(如果这些问题很神秘，而且显然很重要，那么它们就会成为著名的开放性问题，有很多人已经在研究它们了）。因此，这里有一个启发式的方法，那就是由好奇心而不是事业心来驱动--自由发挥你的好奇心，而不是从事你应该从事的工作。

The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious.

  

业绩超线性回报的前景让雄心勃勃的人兴奋不已。  

And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions.  

在这方面有一个好消息：这一领域正在向两个方向扩展。  

There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing.  

有更多类型的工作可以获得超线性回报，而回报本身也在不断增长。

There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.

  

这其中有两个原因，但这两个原因紧密相连，更像是一个半原因：技术的进步和组织重要性的下降。

Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects.

  

五十年前，要开展雄心勃勃的项目，更需要加入一个组织。  

It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution.  

这是获得所需资源的唯一途径，是拥有同事的唯一途径，也是获得分配的唯一途径。  

So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to.  

因此，在 1970 年，在大多数情况下，你的声望就是你所属组织的声望。  

And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much.  

声望是一个准确的预测指标，因为如果你不是一个组织的成员，你就不可能取得什么成就。  

There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands.  

但也有少数例外，其中最著名的是艺术家和作家，他们使用廉价的工具独自工作，并拥有自己的品牌。  

But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences. \[[6](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f6n)\]  

但是，即使是他们，在与受众的接触方面也受到组织的摆布。\[6\]

A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance.

  

由组织主导的世界抑制了绩效回报的变化。  

But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime.  

但是，就在我有生之年，这个世界已经发生了巨大的变化。  

Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century.  

现在，更多的人可以像 20 世纪的艺术家和作家一样拥有自由。  

There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.  

有很多雄心勃勃的项目不需要太多的初始资金，也有很多学习、赚钱、寻找同事和接触受众的新方法。

There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards.

  

旧世界还有很多，但从历史标准来看，变化的速度是巨大的。  

Especially considering what's at stake.  

尤其是考虑到事关重大。  

It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance.  

很难想象还有比绩效回报更根本的变化。

Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes.

  

如果没有机构的抑制作用，结果的差异就会更大。  

Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse.  

这并不意味着每个人都会过得更好：做得好的人会过得更好，但做得不好的人会过得更糟。  

That's an important point to bear in mind.  

这是需要牢记的重要一点。  

Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone.  

并非每个人都能承受超线性回报。  

Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns?  

大多数人都能更好地融入其中。那么，谁应该追求超线性回报呢？  

Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out. \[[7](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f7n)\]  

雄心勃勃的人分为两类：一类人知道自己非常优秀，在变异较大的世界里会一飞冲天；另一类人，尤其是年轻人，有能力冒险一试，以探个究竟。\[7\]

The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants.

  

机构的转变不仅仅是现有居民的外流。  

Many of the new winners will be people they'd never have let in.  

许多新的获奖者将是他们从未让其加入的人。  

So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.  

因此，由此产生的机会民主化将比机构本身可能创造出的任何温顺的校内版本更伟大、更真实。

Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition.

  

并不是每个人都对这种雄心壮志的释放感到高兴。  

It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. \[[8](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f8n)\] But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you. How should you take advantage of it?  

它威胁到一些既得利益，与一些意识形态相悖。\[8\] 但如果你是一个雄心勃勃的人，这对你来说是个好消息。你应该如何利用它呢？

The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work.

  

利用业绩超线性回报的最明显方法就是做特别好的工作。  

At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain.  

在曲线的最末端，渐进式努力是非常划算的。  

All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try.  

这不仅是因为要把一件事做得特别好很难，还因为人们觉得前景太吓人，甚至很少有人尝试。  

Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.  

这意味着，不光是做出色的工作很划算，就连尝试做出色的工作也很划算。

There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it.

  

影响作品好坏的变量有很多，如果你想成为一个例外，就必须几乎把所有变量都做好。例如，要把一件事做得特别好，你必须对它感兴趣。  

Mere diligence is not enough.  

仅仅勤奋是不够的。  

So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. \[[9](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f9n)\] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances.  

因此，在一个回报率超线性的世界里，了解自己的兴趣所在，并想方设法去从事这方面的工作就更有价值了。\[9\] 选择适合自己情况的工作也很重要。  

For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children.  

例如，如果某项工作本身就需要花费大量的时间和精力，那么在年轻、还没有孩子的时候做这项工作就会越来越有价值。

There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It's not just a matter of trying hard.

  

出色的工作中蕴含着惊人的技巧。这不仅仅是努力的问题。  

I'm going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph.  

我想试一试用一段话来介绍食谱。

Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious.

  

选择你有天赋和浓厚兴趣的工作。养成自己做项目的习惯；项目是什么并不重要，只要你觉得这些项目令人兴奋、雄心勃勃就可以了。  

Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge.  

尽你所能地努力工作，而不要焦头烂额，这最终会把你带到知识的前沿。  

These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps.  

从远处看很平滑，但近处看却有很多缝隙。  

Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field.  

注意并探索这些差距，如果幸运的话，其中一个差距会扩展到一个全新的领域。  

Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative.  

在你能承受的范围内冒尽可能大的风险；如果你偶尔没有失败，那可能是你太保守了。  

Seek out the best colleagues.  

寻找最好的同事。  

Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself.  

培养良好的品位，向优秀的榜样学习。要诚实，尤其是对自己。  

Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs.  

多运动，吃好睡好，避免使用危险性更大的药物。  

When in doubt, follow your curiosity.  

有疑问时，请追随你的好奇心。  

It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to. \[[10](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f10n)\]  

它从不说谎，它比你更清楚什么值得关注。\[10\]

And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky.

  

当然，你还需要一件事：幸运。  

Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization.  

运气总是一个因素，但当你独自工作而不是作为组织的一部分工作时，运气的影响就更大了。  

And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about.  

虽然有一些谚语说运气是准备工作与机遇的结合等等，但也有一些真正的偶然因素是你无能为力的。  

The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.  

解决的办法就是多打几针。这也是尽早开始冒险的另一个原因。

The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science.

  

超线性回报领域的最佳范例可能是科学。  

It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at the limits of knowledge.  

它以学习的形式实现指数式增长，并在性能的极端边缘（即知识的极限）设置阈值。

The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison.

  

其结果是，科学发现的不平等程度甚至使最分层社会的财富不平等相比之下都显得轻微。  

Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined. \[[11](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f11n)\]  

牛顿的发现可以说比他同时代所有发现的总和还要伟大。\[11\]

This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out.

  

这一点看似显而易见，但还是要明确指出。  

Superlinear returns imply inequality.  

超线性回报意味着不平等。  

The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.  

回报曲线越陡峭，结果的变化就越大。

In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else.

  

事实上，超线性回报与不平等之间的相关性如此之强，以至于产生了另一种寻找此类工作的启发式：寻找少数几个大赢家表现优于其他人的领域。  

A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.  

一种每个人都做得差不多的工作不太可能有超线性回报。

What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race.

  

在哪些领域中，少数大赢家的表现会优于其他人？以下是一些显而易见的领域：体育、政治、艺术、音乐、表演、导演、写作、数学、科学、创办公司和投资。在体育领域，这种现象是由于外部强加的门槛造成的；你只需要快几个百分点，就能赢得每场比赛。  

In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors.  

在政治领域，权力的增长与帝王时代一样。  

And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be [independent-minded](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html) to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. \[[12](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f12n)\]  

而在其他一些领域（包括政治），成功在很大程度上是由名气驱动的，而名气本身就是超线性增长的源泉。但是，当我们剔除体育和政治以及名气的影响时，就会发现一个显著的规律：剩下的清单与那些你必须具有独立思想才能成功的领域清单完全相同--在这些领域中，你的想法不仅要正确，而且要新颖。\[12\]

This is obviously the case in science.

  

科学显然就是这样。  

You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said.  

你不能发表别人已经说过的论文。  

But it's just as true in investing, for example.  

但以投资为例，情况也是如此。  

It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.  

只有当大多数其他投资者都不相信一家公司会做得好时，相信它才是有用的；如果其他人都认为这家公司会做得好，那么它的股价就已经反映了这一点，也就没有赚钱的空间了。

What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort.

  

我们还能从这些领域学到什么？在所有这些领域，你都必须付出最初的努力。  

Superlinear returns seem small at first. _At this rate,_ you find yourself thinking, _I'll never get anywhere._ But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.  

超线性回报起初看起来很小。按照这样的速度，你会发现自己在想，我永远不会有什么成就。但是，由于回报曲线在远端陡然上升，因此值得采取非常措施来达到目的。

In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth.

  

在初创企业的世界里，这一原则的名称是 "做不会扩展的事情"。如果你对最初的一小部分客户给予了极大的关注，那么理想情况下，你将通过口口相传实现指数级增长。  

But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example.  

但这一原则同样适用于任何呈指数增长的事物。比如学习。  

When you first start learning something, you feel lost.  

刚开始学东西时，你会感到迷茫。  

But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.  

但值得付出最初的努力，因为学得越多，就越容易掌握。

There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job.

  

在这些回报率超高的领域中，还有一个更微妙的教训：不要把工作等同于工作。  

For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job.  

在 20 世纪的大部分时间里，几乎每个人都将这两者等同看待，因此我们继承了将生产力等同于拥有工作的习俗。  

Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means their job.  

即使是现在，对大多数人来说，"你的工作 "也是指他们的工作。  

But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating.  

但对于作家、艺术家或科学家来说，这意味着他们目前正在研究或创作的任何东西。  

For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all.  

对于这样的人来说，如果他们有工作的话，他们的工作就是他们从一份工作到另一份工作的随身物品。  

It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio.  

这可能是为雇主做的，但也是他们作品集的一部分。

It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else.

  

进入一个只有少数几个大赢家超越其他人的领域，是一个令人生畏的前景。  

Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to.  

有些人故意这样做，但你不必这样做。  

If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one.  

如果你有足够的天赋能力，并充分追随自己的好奇心，你最终会进入其中一个领域。你的好奇心不会让你对无聊的问题感兴趣，而有趣的问题往往会创造出具有超线性回报的领域，如果它们还不是其中的一部分的话。

The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static.

  

超线性回报的领域绝非一成不变。  

Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it.  

事实上，最极端的回报来自于扩大它的规模。  

So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two.  

因此，虽然野心和好奇心都能让你进入这个领域，但好奇心可能是两者中更强大的。  

Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.  

野心往往会让你攀登现有的高峰，但如果你足够接近一个足够有趣的问题，它可能会在你脚下成长为一座山峰。

**Notes  

说明**

There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort, performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished in fact.

  

努力、绩效和回报之间的区别是有限的，因为它们实际上并没有明显的区别。  

What counts as return to one person might be performance to another.  

对一个人来说是回报，对另一个人来说可能就是业绩。  

But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they're not meaningless.  

尽管这些概念的边界模糊不清，但它们并非毫无意义。  

I've tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error.  

我尽可能准确地写出他们的故事，但又不出差错。

\[

1\] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance.  

\[1\] 进化本身可能就是超线性绩效回报最普遍的例子。  

But this is hard for us to empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.  

但我们很难对此感同身受，因为我们不是接受者，我们是回报者。

\[

2\] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution.  

\[2\] 当然，在工业革命之前，知识确实产生了实际效果。  

The development of agriculture changed human life completely.  

农业的发展彻底改变了人类的生活。  

But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people.  

但这种变化是技术广泛、渐进改进的结果，而不是少数特别博学的人的发现。

\[

3\] It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor.  

\[3\] 把阶跃函数描述为超线性函数在数学上是不正确的，但从零开始的阶跃函数在描述理性行为者的努力回报曲线时，就像一个超线性函数。  

If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother.  

如果从零开始，那么台阶前的部分就低于任何线性递增的收益，而台阶后的部分必须高于该点的必要收益，否则没人会去管它。

\[

4\] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating.  

\[4\] 寻求竞争可能是一种很好的启发式方法，因为有些人认为竞争能激发他们的积极性。  

It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them promising.  

这在某种程度上也是有前途问题的指南，因为它是其他人认为这些问题有前途的标志。  

But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one.  

但这是一个非常不完美的信号：经常会有一群人吵吵嚷嚷地追逐某个问题，结果都被某个默默研究另一个问题的人打败了。

\[

5\] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule.  

\[5\] 但并非总是如此。你必须谨慎对待这条规则。  

When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why.  

有些东西虽然平庸，但却很受欢迎，这其中往往隐藏着原因。  

Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy.  

也许是垄断或管制使其难以竞争。也许顾客的品味不高，或者决定购买的程序有问题。  

There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons.  

有大量平庸的事物就是因为这些原因而存在的。

\[

6\] In my twenties I wanted to be an [artist](http://www.paulgraham.com/worked.html) and even went to art school to study painting.  

\[6\] 二十多岁时，我想成为一名艺术家，甚至去艺术学校学习绘画。  

Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations.  

主要是因为我喜欢艺术，但艺术家似乎最不受组织的摆布，这也是我的动机之一。

\[

7\] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns.  

\[7\] 原则上，每个人都能获得超线性回报。  

Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life.  

学习是一种复合物，每个人在一生中都在学习。  

But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep.  

但在实践中，很少有人把这种日常学习推向回报曲线变得非常陡峭的地步。

\[

8\] It's unclear exactly what advocates of "equity" mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves.  

\[8\] 现在还不清楚 "公平 "的倡导者究竟是什么意思。他们之间似乎存在分歧。  

But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else.  

但是，无论他们的意思是什么，都可能与这样一个世界不符：在这个世界里，机构控制结果的能力较弱，少数离群者的表现比其他人都要好得多。

It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence.

  

这个概念出现的时候，世界正朝着相反的方向转变，这似乎是它的厄运，但我不认为这是巧合。  

I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance.  

我认为，现在出现这种现象的一个原因是，它的拥护者感到了性能差异迅速增大所带来的威胁。

\[

9\] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.  

\[9\] 推论：如果父母在孩子对医学毫无兴趣的情况下，仍强迫他们从事医学等有名望的工作，那么他们就会比过去更加碌碌无为。

\[

10\] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of "[How to Do Great Work](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)." As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own.  

\[10\] 这一段的最初版本是 "如何做伟大的工作 "的初稿。一写完我就意识到这是一个比超线性回报更重要的话题，所以我暂停了本篇文章，将这一段扩展为自己的内容。  

Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished "How to Do Great Work" I rewrote it based on that.  

实际上，最初的版本已荡然无存，因为在我写完《如何做伟大的工作》之后，我又在此基础上重新写了一遍。

\[

11\] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more.  

\[11\] 在工业革命之前，发家致富的人通常像皇帝一样：夺取一些资源使他们更加强大，并使他们能够夺取更多的资源。  

Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable.  

现在，它可以像科学家一样，通过发现或创造一些独特的有价值的东西来实现。  

Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio has [shifted dramatically](http://www.paulgraham.com/richnow.html) toward discovery just in the last half century.  

大多数致富者都是新旧方法并用，但在最发达的经济体中，仅在过去半个世纪中，新旧方法的比例就急剧向发现型转变。

\[

12\] It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it.  

\[12\] 如果独立思想是不平等的最大驱动力之一，那么思想传统的人不喜欢不平等也就不足为奇了。  

But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't.  

但这并不只是因为他们不希望别人拥有他们无法拥有的东西。  

The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas.  

墨守成规的人根本无法想象拥有新奇想法的滋味。  

So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence.  

因此，对他们来说，成绩的巨大差异似乎是不自然的，当他们遇到这种情况时，他们会认为这一定是由于作弊或某种恶毒的外部影响造成的。**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.

> #CM 文章讨论了地方政府和居民对于发展的态度以及（美国）建筑法规对房价上涨的影响。一些思考问题角度的值得参考。比如地方政府和老百姓在经济增长中的获得的收益。

Local government faces incentives just like everything else. If we want voters to encourage growth near them, we need to make it worth their while.  

地方政府和其他地方政府一样，也面临着激励机制。如果我们想让选民鼓励在他们附近发展，就必须让他们觉得值得。

An ever-expanding body of work shows that increasing local regulations are the main driver of increasing housing prices. Yet there has been less interest in explaining _why_ local regulations are increasing, or why they are rising so much faster in some areas rather than others.  

越来越多的研究表明，越来越多的地方法规是房价上涨的主要驱动力。然而，人们对解释地方法规为何不断增加，或为何某些地区的法规比其他地区增加得更快却兴趣不大。  

Given that the legal authority of local governments to impose zoning or other regulations on building has barely changed over the past few decades, and is fairly constant across the United States, there has to be some cause explaining what turned many pro-development places into anti-development places.  

鉴于地方政府对建筑实施分区或其他法规的法律权力在过去几十年里几乎没有变化，而且在全美范围内也相当稳定，因此许多支持开发的地方变成了反对开发的地方，这其中一定有什么原因。

The best explanation for increasing regulation is that local governments and neighborhoods are less likely to see the gains from growth than they were in the past.  

监管力度加大的最好解释是，地方政府和居民区从增长中获益的可能性比过去小了。  

Local governments used to get substantial fiscal benefits from a growing population, yet now they suffer fiscal costs.  

过去，地方政府从人口增长中获得了可观的财政收益，但现在却付出了财政代价。  

Local homeowners used to see the value of growth in terms of reduced taxes and increased land values, and now they see the increased taxes and worse services.  

当地房主过去认为增长的价值在于减少税收和提高土地价值，而现在他们看到的是税收增加和服务变差。  

States and local governments used to prepare infrastructure before growth happened, but now they let existing residents suffer crowding of roads and schools when new residents arrive.   

过去，国家和地方政府会在经济增长之前准备好基础设施，但现在，当新居民到来时，他们却让现有居民饱受道路和学校拥挤之苦。

Although state legislatures, courts, and YIMBYs, or Yes-In-My-Backyard advocates for more housing, are correct to try to limit the damage of local housing regulations and zoning rules, in some sense they are attacking a symptom instead of the cause of the problem.  

尽管各州立法机构、法院和YIMBYs，即 "我的后院"（Yes-In-My-Backyard）倡导者试图限制地方住房法规和分区规则的破坏是正确的，但从某种意义上说，他们是在治标不治本。  

Many pro-housing advocates assume that local governments always try to block growth, but for most of US history cities sought new residents, and that remains the case in much of the US today.  

许多支持住房的倡导者认为，地方政府总是试图阻止经济增长，但在美国历史上的大部分时间里，城市都在寻求新的居民，如今美国大部分地区的情况依然如此。  

To spur more building, we need to, in a phrase, grow the growth coalition once again by demonstrating to local residents that, even though there are costs to growth, there are even greater gains, and local residents can share in them.   

为了刺激更多的建设，一句话，我们需要再次壮大增长联盟，向当地居民表明，尽管增长需要付出代价，但也有更大的收益，当地居民可以分享这些收益。

### **Local costs and benefits 当地成本和效益**

One of the most surprising things about building regulations in the United States is how extreme they are in some places and how minimal in others. One [study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.1.3) showed that in the mid-2010s over 80 percent of metropolitan areas in the US had median housing costs that were around construction costs – i.e.  

关于美国的建筑法规，最令人惊讶的一点是，有些地方的法规非常极端，而有些地方的法规则微乎其微。一项研究表明，在 2010 年代中期，美国超过 80% 的大都市地区的住房成本中位数与建筑成本相差无几，也就是说，这些地区的住房成本中位数与建筑成本相差无几。  

many places in the US face no housing shortage.   

美国许多地方都不存在住房短缺问题。

A recent [article](https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zoning-Tax-Paper-AER-Version-June-13-2020.pdf) examined the costs imposed by zoning, usually by preventing more intensive development), what is called a ‘zoning tax’, and showed that in half of 24 housing markets studied, ‘\[t\]he typical zoning tax ranges from negligible to small,’ and noted that ‘there is no evidence of an economically meaningful zoning tax’ for housing in much of the US.   

最近有一篇文章研究了分区所带来的成本（通常是通过阻止更密集的开发），也就是所谓的 "分区税"，结果表明，在所研究的 24 个住房市场中，有一半的市场 "典型的分区税从可忽略不计到很小不等"，并指出，在美国大部分地区，"没有证据表明对住房征收了具有经济意义的分区税"。

The lesson from this research is not that the current regulatory regime is unimportant. After all, researchers also [find](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/growth.pdf) that burdens are largest in the most populous and productive areas, especially San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City, and these burdens cause a massive maldistribution of resources.  

从这项研究中得到的教训并不是说现行的监管制度不重要。毕竟，研究人员还发现，在人口最多、生产力最高的地区，尤其是旧金山、波士顿、洛杉矶和纽约市，负担最重，这些负担造成了资源的严重分配不均。  

The research also shows that these burdens grow the closer one gets to the center of a metropolitan area, where the demand is highest.   

研究还表明，越靠近大都市中心，这些负担就越重，因为那里的需求量最大。

Most concerningly, the evidence points to increases in regulatory burdens over time.  

最令人担忧的是，有证据表明，随着时间的推移，监管负担会加重。  

The costs of zoning and regulation were low to nonexistent almost everywhere as recently as the 1980s but have been growing to a larger number of cities and becoming worse in those cities.  

早在 20 世纪 80 年代，几乎所有地方的分区和监管成本都很低，甚至根本不存在，但随着城市数量的增加，这些城市的分区和监管成本也越来越高。  

Housing prices in America were remarkably stable for decades, until they began [exploding](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/08/26/weekinreview/27leon_graph2.html?ref=oembed) in the late 1990s, with what proved to be only a temporary dip around the 2008 financial crisis.  

几十年来，美国的住房价格一直非常稳定，直到 20 世纪 90 年代末才开始暴涨，2008 年金融危机前后，房价才出现短暂回落。

Many pro-housing advocates misunderstand why cities zone and thus why they have increased zoning barriers.  

许多支持住房的倡导者误解了城市划区的原因，因此也误解了为什么要增加划区障碍。  

The most common argument is that cities zone to raise the value of property by restricting the supply of housing. But this gets the economics wrong.  

最常见的说法是，城市区域通过限制住房供应来提高房产价值。但这是错误的经济学观点。  

Imagine a small city of single-family homes that suddenly bans all new development. In the absence of any externalities, i.e.  

想象一下，一个独栋别墅林立的小城市突然禁止了所有新的开发项目。在没有任何外部效应的情况下，即  

the potential negative effects of nearby development, such a change will _lower_ the value of property, because a property that cannot be built up is less valuable than property with that option.  

如果不考虑附近开发可能带来的负面影响，这种变化会降低房产的价值，因为无法被开发的房产不如有这种选择的房产有价值。

If there are some negative externalities to development, such as a gas station that creates a lot of light and traffic near people’s homes, zoning can improve the amenity values of property enough to overcome the loss of options.  

如果开发会带来一些负面的外部效应，比如加油站会在居民住宅附近产生大量的照明和交通流量，那么分区规划可以提高房地产的便利价值，足以弥补选择权的损失。  

But in the most expensive cities in the US the zoning costs are vastly disproportionate to any possible amenity effects.   

但在美国最昂贵的城市中，分区成本与任何可能的美化环境效果都不成比例。

Housing regulations and zoning in much of the US are not adding value to property, they are destroying it. The best studies of zoning’s costs show how much value property-owners _lose_ because they cannot, say, subdivide one lot into four or sell their home to an apartment developer.  

美国大部分地区的住房法规和分区规划不仅没有增加房产的价值，反而破坏了房产的价值。对分区成本的最佳研究表明，由于不能将一块地分割成四块，或者不能将房屋出售给公寓开发商，房产所有者损失了多少价值。  

Pro-development advocates often think of the ‘benefits’ of zoning for a single-family homeowner in the San Francisco Bay Area who can get top-dollar for her home.  

对于旧金山湾区的独户住宅业主来说，支持开发的人经常会想到分区的 "好处"，因为她可以用最高价买到自己的房子。  

But, according to the zoning tax paper discussed above, in San Francisco that homeowner is losing $400,000 in value for every extra quarter acre of undeveloped land she is forced to hold by zoning.   

但是，根据上文讨论的分区税收文件，在旧金山，房主因分区而被迫持有的未开发土地每增加四分之一英亩，就会损失 40 万美元的价值。

So if it often lowers property values, why do so many governments have such extreme zoning laws?  

那么，如果分区往往会降低房产价值，为什么许多政府还要制定如此极端的分区法呢？  

One reason is that in most communities the ‘winners’ from increased development are always small. There are only so many plots that can be built up at any time.  

其中一个原因是，在大多数社区中，开发量增加的 "赢家 "总是很小。在任何时候，可开发的地块都是有限的。  

The vast majority of neighbors only see the negative consequences of someone else developing their land and try to prevent those individuals from developing, even if they could later benefit from developing their own land.  

绝大多数邻居只看到别人开发自己土地的负面影响，并试图阻止这些人开发，即使他们以后可以从开发自己的土地中获益。  

These neighbors can indeed increase the value of their own property by limiting development options on others property, but the end result is lower total property values in a community.  

这些邻居确实可以通过限制他人房产的开发选择来提高自己房产的价值，但最终的结果是降低了社区的总房产价值。

For much of the twentieth century, and in much of the United States today, the main way the developing plots compensated their neighbors was by providing extra fiscal revenue to the rest of the city.  

在二十世纪的大部分时间里，以及在今天美国的大部分地区，发展中地块补偿其邻居的主要方式是为城市的其他部分提供额外的财政收入。  

Although neighbors saw the costs of increased development, they also saw reduced taxes and increased services.  

虽然邻居们看到了开发成本的增加，但他们也看到了税收的减少和服务的增加。  

Cities engaged in ‘fiscal zoning’ to attract the sort of development that brought extra funds and this was the impetus for increased local growth in general.  

城市通过 "财政分区 "来吸引能带来额外资金的发展，这也是地方经济增长的动力。

### **Fiscal zoning 财政分区**

There is a vast body of writing on fiscal zoning and it demonstrates the strong link between the fiscal benefits of different types of development and local increases in those types of developments.  

有大量关于财政分区的论著表明，不同类型开发的财政收益与当地这些类型开发的增长之间存在密切联系。  

In one way, this is intuitive, because cities want more of what will give them more money. But in another way this is counterintuitive, in that the _higher_ the local charges on something, the _more_ of it a city will get.    

从某种程度上说，这是直观的，因为城市想要更多的东西，这将给他们带来更多的钱。但从另一个角度看，这又有悖于直觉，因为地方收费越高的东西，城市得到的就越多。

Much of the [literature](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/52da7c6a-en.pdf?itemId=/content/paper/52da7c6a-en&mimeType=application/pdf) around fiscal zoning focuses on how cities attract different types of properties depending on the type of taxes they impose.  

有关财政分区的大部分文献都关注城市如何根据其征税类型吸引不同类型的房地产。  

For instance, one study found that higher local sales taxes led to more large [retail](https://www.esspri.uci.edu/files/docs/working_papers/burnes_exec.pdf) stores, and a decline in manufacturing employment, since large retail crowded out other types of land uses.  

例如，一项研究发现，较高的地方销售税导致大型零售店增多，制造业就业率下降，因为大型零售店挤占了其他类型的土地用途。  

Most US cities tend to favor commercial property in general, either offices or retail, since they bring in lots of taxes but require little services.  

美国大多数城市都倾向于商业地产，无论是写字楼还是零售店，因为它们能带来大量税收，但对服务的要求却很低。

Other studies have looked at how different types of taxes can deter or attract housing. As early as 1991, economist Joseph Gyourko [noted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009411909190039A?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1) that impact fees, or local charges on new development, could ensure that new housing pays its way.  

其他研究还探讨了不同类型的税收如何阻止或吸引住房建设。早在 1991 年，经济学家约瑟夫-久尔科（Joseph Gyourko）就指出，影响费或地方对新开发项目的收费，可以确保新住房的支付能力。  

Impact fees ‘reduce the incentive for communities to engage in fiscally inspired exclusionary zoning’ and thus the ‘optimal density of new development can increase following the introduction of the fees’. One early [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119006000222) of impact fees indeed found that higher impact fees did not deter building but rather led to increased housing development in Florida suburbs.   

影响费'减少了社区在财政上进行排他性分区的动机'，因此'在引入影响费后，新开发项目的最佳密度会增加'。一项关于影响费的早期研究确实发现，在佛罗里达州的郊区，较高的影响费并没有阻止建设，反而导致了住房开发的增加。

But the largest tax source for local government is property taxes, most importantly those levied on residential property. A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137712000757) of New Hampshire towns showed that higher property taxes caused both smaller lot sizes and smaller houses, which at first might seem to indicate that the tax was stunting development.  

但地方政府最大的税收来源是房产税，其中最重要的是对住宅征收的房产税。对新罕布什尔州城镇的一项研究表明，较高的房产税导致地块面积变小，房屋面积变小，这乍看起来似乎表明房产税阻碍了发展。  

But ironically these changes also led to _more_ living space per developed acre since more housing was permitted there.   

但具有讽刺意味的是，这些变化也导致每英亩开发面积的居住面积增加，因为那里允许建造更多的住房。

Some pro-housing advocates have attacked local impact fees or property taxes as a deterrence to construction and have advocated for reducing them or centralizing them at the state level.  

一些支持住房的倡导者抨击地方影响费或房产税阻碍了建筑业的发展，并主张减少这些费用或将其集中到州一级。  

Historically, however, the common argument against such local taxes was that they drove too much development. As one academic article from about two decades earlier [said,](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43201624) ‘The urban planners’ most frequent objection to local tax reliance \[is\] that it induces too much growth and blinds communities to regional and environmental planning objectives.’ One pro-development San Francisco Bay Area newspaper in the 1960s advocated for building on a local pasture by reminding its readers: ‘Cows don’t pay taxes!’   

然而，从历史上看，反对这种地方税的常见论点是它们推动了过多的发展。正如大约二十年前的一篇学术文章所说，"城市规划者最常反对依赖地方税收，\[是\]它诱发了过多的增长，使社区无法实现地区和环境规划目标。20 世纪 60 年代，旧金山湾区一家支持开发的报纸在鼓吹在当地牧场上建房时提醒读者：'奶牛不交税！'。

The connection between local revenues and growth is international. A Journal of Housing Economics [study](https://maxvehrlich.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ehrlich_Hilber_Schoeni_JHE_2018.pdf) found a connection between European countries that allowed local governments to keep more revenue and countries that allowed more development.  

地方收入与经济增长之间的联系是国际性的。住房经济学杂志》的一项研究发现，允许地方政府保留更多收入的欧洲国家与允许更多发展的国家之间存在联系。  

In countries like Austria and Switzerland, local or regional governments had more local autonomy and kept larger percentages of the fiscal upside to growth and thus were more likely to support it.  

在奥地利和瑞士等国，地方或地区政府拥有更多的地方自治权，保留了更大比例的财政增长空间，因此更有可能支持经济增长。  

In countries with more centralized governments and fiscal control, such as the United Kingdom, local governments only got the downsides to growth, and thus restricted it.  

在政府和财政控制较为集中的国家，如英国，地方政府只了解增长的弊端，因此限制了增长。  

According to the study, decentralized countries had over a fourth more development in outlying areas, and corresponding lower housing prices, than the centralized countries.  

根据这项研究，与中央集权国家相比，地方分权国家在外围地区的开发程度要高出四分之一以上，房价也相应较低。

In the United Kingdom in 1990 a national reform took commercial property taxes out of the hands of local governments and put them in a central pot administered from Westminster. One [study](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/4372/1/Office_space_supply_restrictions_%28LSERO_version%29.pdf) showed that cities responded by allowing less commercial real estate. There has been a [recent](https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/business/lack-of-lab-space-is-threat-to-cambridge-s-life-sciences-bo-9268461/) [spate](https://www.ft.com/content/397a75aa-3047-432e-8664-d1974fbb05df) of [articles](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/uk-firms-face-critical-lab-space-shortage/4016403.article) noting the absence of sufficient laboratory space around Oxford and Cambridge, and how this is inhibiting medical breakthroughs. Some [reports](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/broken-planning-system-is-depriving-biotech-of-quality-lab-space-gtlxjscpv) note that the planning system is to blame, but they rarely highlight how the current fiscal structure gives cities few reasons to build.   

1990 年，英国进行了一项全国性改革，将商业地产税从地方政府手中剥离，交由威斯敏斯特中央银行管理。 一项研究表明，各城市的反应是减少商业地产。最近有大量文章指出，牛津和剑桥附近缺乏足够的实验室空间，这如何阻碍了医学突破。一些报道指出规划系统难辞其咎，但却很少强调当前的财政结构如何使城市几乎没有理由进行建设。

Although China hardly provides an example of an even-handed housing policy, it has given local governments ample incentive to grow.  

尽管中国的住房政策很难说是公平的，但它为地方政府的发展提供了充足的动力。  

Local governments in China own the rights to develop new land and in many years make almost a third of their [revenue](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/local-governments-china-rely-heavily-land-revenu) from the sale of those land rights. Further local revenue comes from taxes on land and housing. Most observers agree that Chinese local governments’ [dependence](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.1.93) on these revenues explains why they have been rapidly expanding housing.   

中国的地方政府拥有新土地的开发权，在许多年里，其收入的近三分之一来自出售这些土地权。此外，地方收入还来自土地和住房税收。大多数观察家都认为，中国地方政府对这些收入的依赖解释了为什么他们一直在迅速扩大住房规模。

Just as we have evidence that increasing the fiscal benefits of development can spur it, we also have evidence that decreasing fiscal burdens does the same.  

正如我们有证据表明，增加发展的财政收益可以刺激发展一样，我们也有证据表明，减少财政负担同样可以刺激发展。  

One odd fact about school districts in America is that they don’t always overlap with local city boundaries. One [study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2018.1.02?journalCode=ntj) showed that cities in Ohio were more likely to approve development if the land was in a school district that itself was not largely overlapping with the rest of the city.  

关于美国学区的一个奇怪事实是，它们并不总是与当地城市的边界重叠。一项研究表明，俄亥俄州的城市更倾向于批准开发位于学区内的土地，因为学区本身与城市的其他部分并不完全重叠。  

The reason is the city got the direct fiscal benefits of the development, but most residents of the city did not have to pay the cost of educating more students.   

原因是该市获得了发展带来的直接财政利益，但该市的大多数居民却不必为更多学生的教育支付成本。

Cities respond to incentives like other organizations or individuals. If you give them more reason to grow, they will grow more.  

城市与其他组织或个人一样，会对激励措施做出反应。如果你给它们更多发展的理由，它们就会发展得更快。  

But these days they have less incentive to grow than ever.  

但如今，它们发展的动力比以往任何时候都要小。

### **Why don’t cities want to grow anymore?  

为什么城市不想再发展了？**

As early as the 1960s, there was widespread acknowledgement that zoning was no longer about far-sighted planners setting goals for development, but about trading development for cash.  

早在 20 世纪 60 年代，人们就普遍认识到，分区规划不再是高瞻远瞩的规划者制定发展目标，而是用发展换取现金。  

In 1965, the head of the American Society of Planning Officials bemoaned that zoning had become a ‘marketable commodity’.  

1965 年，美国规划官员协会负责人抱怨说，分区已经成为一种 "适销对路的商品"。  

Of course the salability of zoning has issues of its own, but the question is why an American fiscal zoning regime which once was willing to make the trade of growth for taxes has forsworn it.   

当然，分区的可销售性本身也有问题，但问题是，为什么曾经愿意以增长换税收的美国财政分区制度放弃了这一点。

One of the most consequential reasons is school finance reform, which is particularly important because schools absorb about half of all local property taxes.  

其中一个最重要的原因是学校财务改革，这一点尤为重要，因为学校吸收了大约一半的地方财产税。  

From the 1970s through the 1990s, a series of state court cases claimed that funding schools based on local property taxes was inequitable and unfair.  

从 20 世纪 70 年代到 90 年代，州法院审理了一系列案件，声称根据地方财产税为学校提供资金是不公平和不公正的。  

Subsequent rulings and legislative changes tried to equalize spending on students, often by ‘taxing’ property-tax rich districts to redistribute funds to property-tax poor districts.  

随后的裁决和立法修改试图均衡学生支出，通常是通过对财产税富裕的地区 "征税"，将资金重新分配给财产税贫穷的地区。  

Early litigators not only ignored that there was little correlation between rich districts and rich people (central cities with the most poor and minority students had disproportionately high property values due to downtown commercial real estate), they also ignored how these rulings could upset the incentives facing local cities.  

早期的诉讼律师不仅忽视了富裕地区与富裕人群之间并无多大关联（贫困学生和少数民族学生最多的中心城市因市中心的商业地产而拥有不成比例的高财产价值），还忽视了这些裁决会如何扰乱当地城市所面临的激励机制。

The California case of _Serrano v. Priest_ (1976), the first significant state court school ‘equalization’ ruling, was a major cause two years later of Prop 13, the California initiative which sharply limited property taxes.  

加利福尼亚州的塞拉诺诉普里斯特案（1976 年）是州法院对学校 "均等化 "做出的第一个重要裁决，也是两年后加州提出大幅限制财产税的提案 13 的主要原因。  

Although a similar property tax limitation measure was voted down by almost two to one before the _Serrano_ ruling, after the Serrano ruling it triumphed by almost the reverse ratio.  

尽管在塞拉诺案裁决之前，一项类似的财产税限制措施几乎以二比一的比例被否决，但在塞拉诺案裁决之后，该措施几乎以相反的比例获胜。  

Cities with the highest property tax values per pupil, in other words, the areas most likely to lose funds from the _Serrano_ ruling, [saw](https://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/files/49st0535.pdf) the sharpest rise in support for tax limitation.  

学生人均财产税价值最高的城市，换句话说，也就是最有可能因塞拉诺案的裁决而失去资金的地区，支持限制税收的人数急剧上升。

Voters felt that if property taxes were going to be redistributed away, they did not want to pay them.  

选民们认为，如果财产税要重新分配，他们就不想缴纳。  

The end of local governments’ ability to both use new development to reduce local taxes and to fund better schools has been a major reason for the increased opposition to housing in California, which now has by far the greatest burden of excessive zoning.   

地方政府不再有能力利用新的开发项目来减少地方税收，也不再有能力为更好的学校提供资金，这是加州反对住房的呼声日益高涨的主要原因。

School finance reforms reduced the benefits of all sorts of development. One [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24243719) looked at communities with nuclear power plants before and after the finance reforms. The huge property tax gains of these plants were once a way to offset local opposition to them.  

学校财务改革降低了各种发展的效益。一项研究考察了财政改革前后拥有核电站的社区。这些核电站带来的巨额财产税收益曾一度抵消了当地的反对意见。  

But after school finance reform redistributed local property taxes, the study showed the homes in communities with these nuclear plants lost value, since they no longer got the fiscal boost to offset local concerns about nuclear power.  

但在学校财政改革重新分配地方财产税后，研究显示，这些核电站所在社区的房屋价值下降，因为它们不再获得财政支持，以抵消地方对核电的担忧。  

This same scenario played out thousands of times across all of the locally unwanted land uses in the nation, including, often, new housing.  

同样的情况在全国所有地方不受欢迎的土地用途中上演了成千上万次，其中往往包括新建住房。  

What was once conceived as a potential trade of more local development for higher tax revenue has now become a burden without offsetting benefits.   

曾经被认为是以更多的地方发展换取更高的税收的潜在交易，现在却成了一种没有抵消收益的负担。

The benefits of new development have also been inhibited by property tax ‘modernization’.  

财产税的 "现代化 "也抑制了新发展带来的好处。  

In the past, many governments pursued what became ironically known as a ‘welcome stranger’ policy, whereby new developments got assessed at a higher level, and therefore had to pay more property taxes, than existing development.  

过去，许多国家的政府奉行具有讽刺意味的 "欢迎陌生人 "政策，即新开发项目的评估水平高于现有开发项目，因此必须缴纳更多的房产税。  

This gave local governments an extra reason to, indeed, welcome strangers.  

这给了地方政府一个额外的理由来欢迎陌生人。  

But in the similar time period as school finance reform, many states reformed property taxes to make sure they were assessed equally across different properties, and thus limited the property tax benefits existing homeowners had acquired.  

但在与学校财务改革相近的时期，许多州都对房产税进行了改革，以确保对不同房产进行平等评估，从而限制现有房主获得的房产税优惠。  

As Isaac William Martin showed in his book, [_The Permanent Tax Revolt_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Permanent_Tax_Revolt/Rc4ZDgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=isaac+martin+permanent+tax+revolt&printsec=frontcover)_,_ property tax modernization preceded and contributed to many tax limitation measures, including in California, Massachusetts, and New York, and thus further inhibited the gains local governments and homeowners could get from growth.  

正如艾萨克-威廉-马丁在其《永久性税收反叛》一书中所指出的，财产税现代化先于并促成了许多税收限制措施，包括加利福尼亚州、马萨诸塞州和纽约州的措施，从而进一步抑制了地方政府和房主从经济增长中获得的收益。

Partially because of these property tax reforms, many cities have moved to demanding impact fees and ‘exactions’, such as developer-funded local parks.  

部分由于这些财产税改革，许多城市开始要求征收影响费和 "附加费"，如开发商出资修建当地公园。  

In this sense the trade of new development for money has become clearer than ever.  

从这个意义上说，用新发展换取资金的交易比以往任何时候都更加清晰。  

Yet one-off income or services are less likely to benefit communities than continuing income and services.  

然而，与持续性收入和服务相比，一次性收入或服务不太可能使社区受益。  

Many courts, including the US Supreme Court, have also made trades of exactions for development harder. In cases such as [_Nollan v. California Coastal Commission_](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1986/86-133) (1987)_,_ [_Dolan v. Tigard_](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&context=lawreview) (1994) and [_Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District_](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/11-1447) (2013), the Supreme Court has limited the demands that local governments can place on new development to provide or fund other infrastructure.   

包括美国最高法院在内的许多法院也加大了开发征收费用的难度。在 Nollan 诉加州海岸委员会（1987 年）、Dolan 诉 Tigard（1994 年）和 Koontz 诉圣约翰斯河水管理区（2013 年）等案件中，最高法院限制了地方政府为提供或资助其他基础设施而对新开发项目提出的要求。

In _Dolan,_ for instance, the Supreme Court struck down an Oregon city’s approval of a local store expansion that was dependent on dedicating a public greenway.  

例如，在多兰案中，最高法院驳回了俄勒冈州一个城市对当地一家商店扩建的批准，该商店的扩建取决于一条公共绿道的奉献。  

The Court declared that the demand was an ‘unconstitutional condition’ on the permit that bore little relation to the actual impact of the new development and therefore was a taking of property without just compensation.  

法院宣布，该要求是许可证上的一个 "违宪条件"，与新开发项目的实际影响关系不大，因此属于无正当补偿的财产占有。  

Even if this and other exactions _were_ extortionary, the alternative to such extortion was often no development at all.  

即使这种勒索和其他勒索是敲诈性的，但这种敲诈的替代办法往往是根本不开发。  

By limiting trades while placing minimal limits on zoning’s ability to block developments, the courts have exacerbated the problem of making sure neighbors can see the benefits of growth.   

法院在限制交易的同时，却对分区规划阻止开发的能力施加了最低限度的限制，这加剧了确保邻居能够看到发展带来的好处的问题。

One final reason trades don’t happen is that the combination of increased state and federal rules around infrastructure and of the increased number of different groups or individuals that could block such infrastructure (called ‘veto points’ or ‘veto players’) means local governments can’t credibly commit to offsetting the impacts of development.   

贸易不会发生的最后一个原因是，各州和联邦有关基础设施的规定越来越多，而且可能阻止这些基础设施的不同团体或个人（称为 "否决点 "或 "否决者"）也越来越多，这意味着地方政府无法可信地承诺抵消发展带来的影响。

State transportation bureaucracies and regional ‘Metropolitan Planning Organizations’ have federally mandated 20-plus year plans for road and transit building.  

各州交通局和地区 "大都市规划组织 "都有联邦授权的 20 多年道路和交通建设计划。  

Since funding is baked into such plans, and determined by factors beyond local growth, it’s hard for local governments to adapt to pleas of developers that don’t fit perfectly into them. One [study](https://matthewturner.org/papers/published/Duranton_Turner_RES_2012.pdf) showed that while increased road building in the US led to increased local employment, the effect was minimized because the roads often went to areas that had stagnant or declining populations, as a kind of subsidized construction jobs program.  

由于资金被纳入此类计划，并由当地增长以外的因素决定，因此地方政府很难适应不完全符合计划的开发商的要求。一项研究表明，在美国，虽然道路建设的增加带动了当地就业率的提高，但由于这些道路通常建在人口停滞或下降的地区，作为一种补贴性的建筑就业计划，其效果被降到了最低。  

The potential for opponents of development to use lawsuits, environmental laws and bureaucracies, and other means to block new infrastructure means that even if a local government promises to build roads or infrastructure to offset the impact of new housing, they often can’t guarantee it will happen.  

反对开发的人可能会利用诉讼、环境法和官僚机构以及其他手段来阻止新的基础设施建设，这意味着即使地方政府承诺修建道路或基础设施来抵消新住房带来的影响，也往往无法保证一定会实现。

Increasing infrastructure allows and encourages more cities to grow. One study found the [construction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166046215000496) of highways in Spanish cities was followed by zoning changes which led to more development. Another [showed](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-road-infrastructure-effects-firms) that a ten percent increase in accessibility from road-building in Britain led to up to a four percent increase in local employment and the number of firms, and also led to increased local productivity.  

基础设施的增加允许并鼓励更多城市发展。一项研究发现，西班牙城市在修建高速公路后进行了分区改革，从而带动了更多的发展。另一项研究表明，英国的道路建设使交通便利程度提高了 10%，从而使当地的就业率和企业数量增加了 4%，并提高了当地的生产率。  

Although upzoning is necessary for growth, it is not sufficient since the growth needs infrastructure.  

虽然分区规划对增长是必要的，但这还不够，因为增长需要基础设施。  

Either developers will fail to develop areas where there is not sufficient local infrastructure, or voters who worry about the crowding of local infrastructure will have more reasons and find more ways to block it.  

要么开发商不开发当地基础设施不足的地区，要么担心当地基础设施被挤占的选民会有更多理由、找到更多方法来阻止开发。

### **Making cities and neighbors part of the growth coalition  

让城市和邻居成为增长联盟的一部分**

Restoring local fiscal incentives to build should be at the forefront of a pro-growth agenda.  

在促进增长的议程中，最重要的是恢复地方对建设的财政激励。  

We know that keeping local fiscal incentives in place, or creating new ones, can expand development.  

我们知道，保留地方财政激励措施或制定新的激励措施可以扩大发展。  

For instance, although Britain centralized commercial property taxes in 1990 because its Conservative government was concerned about local governments being ‘anti-business’, it knew the government of the ‘City of London’ – the financial district in central London – was not, so the government allowed _it_ to set and keep a substantial portion of its own local business tax revenues, unlike other local governments in Britain.   

例如，尽管英国在 1990 年集中征收商业地产税，因为保守党政府担心地方政府 "反商业"，但它知道 "伦敦金融城"（伦敦市中心的金融区）政府并不 "反商业"，因此政府允许它制定并保留自己地方商业税收的很大一部分，这与英国其他地方政府不同。

The result was that after 1990 the City of London, partially inspired by the competing Docklands (Canary Wharf) area that was already outside the normal local government system, became relatively more likely to approve development than other cities and boroughs. Another [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800915301361) focused on the introduction of a local property tax in Italy in 1993 and found that it led cities to adopt less stringent planning and thus ‘facilitated local development’.   

其结果是，1990 年后，伦敦市（部分原因是受到竞争激烈的码头区（金丝雀码头）的启发，该地区已经脱离了正常的地方政府体系，相对而言，伦敦市比其他城市和行政区更有可能批准开发项目。另一项研究侧重于 1993 年在意大利引入的地方财产税，结果发现，该税导致城市采用了不太严格的规划，从而 "促进了地方发展"。

In the United States, reversing a history of school equalization rulings and legislative changes, either by returning taxing power to local communities again or by structuring a state funding system that does not penalize communities for raising more funds, may be an important part of such a pro-growth agenda.   

在美国，通过将征税权重新交还给地方社区，或者通过构建一个不会因社区筹集更多资金而对其进行惩罚的州资助体系，扭转学校均等化裁决和立法变革的历史，可能是这种有利于增长的议程的重要组成部分。

The rise of new school finance reforms, such as state-level education savings accounts and school vouchers, also could ensure more local benefits of growth.  

新的学校财务改革的兴起，如州一级的教育储蓄账户和学校代金券，也可以确保更多的地方增长利益。  

In America, these new education savings account or voucher programs provide families funding directly from the state to educate their children almost wherever they would like.  

在美国，这些新的教育储蓄账户或教育券计划直接从州政府为家庭提供资金，让他们的孩子几乎可以在任何他们想去的地方接受教育。  

But about half of school funding still comes from local governments, even if some of that is then redistributed according to state formulas.  

但是，大约一半的学校经费仍然来自地方政府，即使其中的一部分是根据州政府的公式重新分配的。  

New account and voucher programs tend to leave that local funding alone.  

新的账户和代金券计划往往不考虑地方资金。  

Despite complaints that these new programs are ‘robbing’ public schools, for every student who uses them to pursue a private education, local school districts get to keep the money they raised from property taxes, but don’t have to spend a dime to educate the student.  

尽管有人抱怨这些新项目是在 "抢劫 "公立学校，但对于每一个利用这些项目接受私立教育的学生，当地学区都可以保留他们从财产税中筹集到的资金，而不必为学生的教育花费一分钱。  

That means that local governments will keep more of the fiscal upside from new families, for spending on other things or reducing school property taxes.   

这意味着地方政府将保留更多新家庭带来的财政增长，用于其他方面的支出或减少学校的财产税。

Even if an entire municipality gets financial benefits from development, it’s difficult to guarantee that such funds are directed at the local neighborhoods that are most affected by new development.  

即使整个城市都能从开发中获得经济利益，也很难保证这些资金会用于受新开发影响最大的当地社区。  

And in the modern era, neighbors have more power than in the past. So states and local governments should find new ways for nearby property holders to see benefits from upzonings.  

在现代社会，邻居们比过去拥有更多的权力。因此，各州和地方政府应该找到新的方法，让附近的房产持有者从提高地价中获益。  

For instance, in 1974 developers and local government in Virginia helped enact a formal ‘proffer’ law, which allowed legally enforceable exchanges of amenities such as new roads for zoning changes, and which helped accelerate Northern Virginia’s explosive [growth](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-dc-densified).   

例如，1974 年，弗吉尼亚州的开发商和地方政府共同制定了一项正式的 "提议 "法，允许以法律上可强制执行的设施（如新建道路）换取分区变更，这有助于加速弗吉尼亚州北部的爆炸式增长。

One of the big reasons for neighbor opposition to development is that while the total value of land can go up, some property can actually decrease in value as the character of a neighborhood changes.  

邻居反对开发的一个重要原因是，虽然土地的总价值会上升，但随着社区特色的改变，一些房产的价值实际上会下降。  

Thus cities should find new ways to help neighbors band together for sales.  

因此，城市应该找到新的方法，帮助邻居们联合起来进行销售。  

This would help neighbors share in the gains of growth and not be left out of deals that could reshape their neighborhoods.  

这将有助于邻居们分享增长带来的收益，而不会被排除在可能重塑其社区的交易之外。

As Robert Nelson noted in his book [_Private Neighborhoods and the Transformation of Local Government_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Private_Neighborhoods_and_the_Transforma/V8TUojBxYKAC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=private+neighborhoods+nelson&printsec=frontcover) some neighborhoods have done this on their own.  

正如罗伯特-尼尔森（Robert Nelson）在其著作《私营街区与地方政府转型》（Private Neighborhoods and the Transformation of Local Governments）一书中所指出的，一些街区已经独立完成了这项工作。  

In Atlanta two decades ago, 118 homeowners formed a single corporation to sell their homes to a developer, who could give them double to triple the price of their existing lots.  

二十年前，在亚特兰大，118 名房主成立了一家公司，将他们的房屋出售给开发商，开发商可以给他们现有地块两倍到三倍的价格。  

In Vienna, Virginia, 70 homeowners near a Metro subway stop got together in 2004 to sell their homes to a developer who planned to densify, and they got almost double their existing value.   

在弗吉尼亚州维也纳，地铁站附近的 70 名房主于 2004 年聚集在一起，将他们的房屋出售给了一家计划进行密集化改造的开发商，他们获得了几乎是现有价值两倍的收益。

The problem with deals between property-holders is that they require unanimous agreement.  

财产所有者之间的交易问题在于需要一致同意。  

Yet there are ways for cities to help organize property-holders to overcome a small minority of holdouts. In one case.  

然而，城市也有办法帮助组织房产持有者，以克服少数人的顽固立场。其中一个例子是  

Fairfax County in Virginia promised to rezone a neighborhood for commercial development if 85 percent of the homeowners could agree to a joint sale.  

弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯县承诺，如果 85% 的业主同意联合出售，该县将重新划分一个社区的商业开发区域。  

The county thus would force the hand of the few remaining holdouts to a deal.因此，该县将迫使剩下的少数几个坚持己见者达成交易。  

Cities in general could explain to property-holders ahead of time that getting supermajority buy-in to a collective sale would lead to a rezoning and thus increased sale prices.  

一般来说，城市可以提前向房产持有者解释，如果集体出售获得超级多数的支持，将导致重新规划，从而提高售价。  

By working with such property associations, they could encourage more win-win situations. Policy Exchange in Britain has [proposed](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Strong-Suburbs.pdf) ‘Street Votes’, which would allow a supermajority of residents on some streets to upzone and receive a part of the financial gains resulting from such upzoning.  

通过与这些物业协会合作，他们可以鼓励更多的双赢局面。英国的 Policy Exchange 公司提出了 "街道投票 "建议，允许某些街道上的绝大多数居民上调分区，并获得上调分区后的部分经济收益。  

The British government has supported pilots of the idea.  

英国政府支持这一想法的试点。

There are some precedents for states allowing a majority of property-holders to force holdouts to join a new group.  

各州允许多数财产持有人强迫持反对意见者加入新团体的做法有一些先例。  

As Robert Nelson notes, one example is unitization law, whereby multiple oil drillers can take a vote to create a single united ‘pool’ of their property to reduce duplicative drilling and avoid wasting oil.  

正如罗伯特-尼尔森（Robert Nelson）所指出的，其中一个例子就是单位化法，根据该法，多个石油钻探商可以通过投票将其财产合并成一个 "池子"，以减少重复钻探，避免浪费石油。  

They sacrifice some of their independence for higher property values and returns.  

他们牺牲了部分独立性，以换取更高的财产价值和回报。  

Oklahoma, for example, requires 63 percent vote to ‘unitize’ a pool, with the votes weighted by the proportion of land each holder owns above the pool.  

例如，俄克拉荷马州要求 63% 的投票权才能将水池 "单位化"，投票权按每个持有人在水池上方拥有的土地比例加权计算。

Although forcing existing homeowners into a new ‘unitization’ agreement would be impossible in most existing neighborhoods, cities can encourage the formation of groups that allow less than unanimous sales.  

虽然强迫现有业主签订新的 "单元化 "协议在大多数现有社区是不可能的，但城市可以鼓励成立允许非一致销售的团体。  

Some state laws allow entire condominiums to be sold with less than 100 percent agreement of individual unit owners. In [Arizona](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01228.htm) and [Texas](https://www.kut.org/austin/2023-01-24/in-texas-you-can-be-forced-to-sell-your-condo) condominium owners can sell an entire building with just 80 percent agreement of the holders.  

有些州的法律允许在未获得单个单元业主 100%同意的情况下出售整栋公寓。在亚利桑那州和得克萨斯州，公寓业主只需获得 80% 的业主同意，就可以出售整栋大楼。  

Most single-family homeowners’ associations don’t allow forced sales, but the association can sometimes be terminated with just 80 percent agreement and the common areas sold off, which is a big incentive for others to join any subsequent sale, since the neighborhood has agreed to fundamentally transform itself.   

大多数独户住宅业主协会不允许强制出售，但有时只需 80% 的人同意，就可以终止协会并出售公共区域，这对其他人加入后续出售是一个很大的激励，因为社区已经同意从根本上改造自己。

As well as encouraging corporatisation and new local government forms among homeowners and resident groups, local governments should also have more authority to plan and fund infrastructure.  

除了在业主和居民团体中鼓励公司化和新的地方政府形式外，地方政府还应拥有更多规划和资助基础设施的权力。  

And insofar as state and federal governments are funding infrastructure, they should attach the funds to areas that are growing.  

只要州政府和联邦政府为基础设施提供资金，就应该将资金投入到正在增长的领域。  

Most importantly, state and local transportation departments need to prepare more roads in developing areas. According to the Urban Institute, road and highway spending [grew](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/highway-and-road-expenditures#Question2Highway) slower than any other type of state and local spending from the 1970s until today.   

最重要的是，州和地方交通部门需要在发展中地区修建更多的道路。根据城市研究所（Urban Institute）的数据，从 20 世纪 70 年代至今，公路和高速公路支出的增长速度低于任何其他类型的州和地方支出。

In almost all of the US, cars are still the main way to get around.  

在美国几乎所有地区，汽车仍然是主要的出行方式。  

For travel of less than 500 miles, cars were used in over 95 percent of US trips, while buses and trains together were less than 3 percent, and of course the buses need roadway.  

在少于 500 英里的旅行中，95% 以上的美国旅行使用的是汽车，而公共汽车和火车加在一起还不到 3%，当然公共汽车也需要公路。  

Even in New York City, by far America’s most dense and transit-dependent big city, people [use](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/nyc-streets-plan-spread.pdf) cars and transit about equally, and cars and buses together far more than trains.  

即使是在纽约这个迄今为止美国人口密度最高、最依赖公交的大城市，人们使用汽车和公交的比例也差不多，而汽车和公交车的共同使用率远远高于火车。  

The simple truth is that unless government is willing to build or support new roads and improve existing ones, pro-development groups will have no answer to the [concerns](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pt5t1gt) with traffic that motivate much opposition to development.  

一个简单的事实是，除非政府愿意修建或支持新的道路，并改善现有道路，否则支持开发的团体将无法回答人们对交通的担忧，而这种担忧正是许多人反对开发的动机。  

If cities and states make the new routes self-financing variable toll roads, they can both ensure drivers pay the cost of the roads and that traffic jams are kept to a minimum.   

如果各城市和各州让新开通的线路成为自筹资金的可变收费公路，就既能确保驾驶员支付公路成本，又能将交通拥堵控制在最低限度。

Transit in those areas where it is necessary should be funded to the greatest extent possible by ‘land value capture’.  

在有必要的地区，应尽可能通过 "土地增值 "来为公共交通提供资金。  

In this model, the transit developer either owns the land to be developed around the transit stops or receives some of the gains from the increase in the value of the land resulting from the transit project.  

在这种模式中，公交开发商要么拥有公交站点周围待开发的土地，要么从公交项目带来的土地增值中获得部分收益。  

In this way, the transit developer, whether public or private, is able to reap some of the extra value they have created.  

这样，无论是公共还是私营的交通开发商，都能获得他们创造的一些额外价值。  

Many of the earliest ‘streetcar suburbs’ in America were created by streetcar companies who expected to profit off nearby real estate investments, and the modern Hong Kong and Japanese transit [systems](https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/conference-papers/transit-value-capture) also grew partially as ways to bolster real estate projects.   

美国许多最早的 "有轨电车郊区 "都是由有轨电车公司创建的，他们期望从附近的房地产投资中获利。

For all sorts of infrastructure, more states should mimic the ‘Municipal Utility Districts’ or MUDs, in Texas.  

对于各种基础设施，更多的州应效仿得克萨斯州的 "市政公用事业区"（MUDs）。  

Developers often form MUDs on undeveloped land, then issue bonds to build roads, water, sewerage or other infrastructure on that land.  

开发商通常在未开发的土地上成立 MUD，然后发行债券，在这些土地上修建道路、供水、排污或其他基础设施。  

The bonds are supported by property taxes on the existing land and the burdens on any landholder decreases as the development grows.  

债券由现有土地的财产税支持，任何土地持有者的负担都会随着开发项目的增长而减轻。  

Although MUDs or other ‘special districts’ can last past their time and become tax sinks, in the development stage there are few substitutes for making sure the costs and benefits of growth are ‘internalized’ and paid for by new residents.  

虽然 MUD 或其他 "特别区 "可能会持续过久并成为税源，但在发展阶段，确保增长的成本和收益 "内部化 "并由新居民支付的替代品并不多。  

By creating more competing developments, such projects also limit the ability of existing cities to extract monopoly rents from restricting their own growth, just as more competing companies limit the profits a monopolistic company can get from cutting production.  

通过创造更多相互竞争的发展项目，这些项目也限制了现有城市通过限制自身发展来获取垄断租金的能力，就像更多相互竞争的公司限制了垄断公司通过削减产量来获取利润一样。

### **Why steamroller approaches are not enough  

为什么蒸气机式的方法是不够的**

Much of the YIMBY movement has focused on striking down the local barriers to building. Such laws have had real successes in limiting excessive restrictions on development.  

YIMBY运动的大部分内容都集中在消除当地的建设障碍上。这些法律在限制过度开发方面取得了实际成效。  

But one reason that such efforts, or what could be called a ‘steamroller’ approach, are not sufficient on their own is that there is a high level of demand for local control of neighborhoods, and if cities don’t provide for some amount of local control, other, sometimes even less pro-development, organizations will.   

但是，这种努力或可称为 "强力推进 "的方法本身并不充分，其中一个原因是，人们对地方控制社区的要求很高，如果城市不提供一定程度的地方控制，其他组织，有时甚至是不那么支持发展的组织，就会提供。

Whatever one thinks of homeowners’ associations, their striking growth points to Americans’ desire to have some authority over their neighborhood.  

无论人们对业主协会有什么看法，它们的显著增长都表明，美国人希望对自己的社区拥有一定的管理权。  

Almost 30 percent of all Americans now live in a community property association of some sort, the large majority of which involve homeowners associations, typically of single-family homes or townhouses.  

目前，近 30% 的美国人生活在某种社区财产协会中，其中绝大多数涉及业主协会，通常是单户住宅或联排别墅的业主协会。  

Such associations were almost unknown in the 1940s and ‘50s, but by the 1980s and 1990s [half of all new homes](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Private_Neighborhoods_and_the_Transforma.html?id=c7GNAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y) were part of a community association. Today, over [two-thirds](https://foundation.caionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2021-2CAIStatsReviewWeb.pdf) of all new homes include a community association of some sort, so the total proportion of housing in them will keep increasing.   

在二十世纪四五十年代，这种协会几乎无人知晓，但到了二十世纪八九十年代，一半的新建住宅都加入了社区协会。如今，超过三分之二的新建住宅都包含了某种社区协会，因此社区协会住宅的总比例还将继续增加。

These associations are composed of property-holders who unanimously agreed to be subject to rules that would make the most restrictive cities blanch, such as rules about paint colors or the times of year flags can be flown.  

这些协会由房产所有者组成，他们一致同意遵守一些令最严格的城市都望而却步的规定，如关于油漆颜色或一年中可以悬挂旗帜的时间的规定。  

In the future, helping local neighborhoods in general and community associations in particular see the benefits of development will be crucial for encouraging growth.  

今后，帮助当地居民区，特别是社区协会看到发展带来的好处，对于鼓励发展至关重要。  

This will mean making sure cities share some of the fiscal revenue they get from growth with those associations and making sure they provide the infrastructure to offset growth (or make it easy for other organizations to do so).  

这意味着要确保城市与这些协会分享从增长中获得的部分财政收入，并确保它们提供基础设施来抵消增长（或让其他组织更容易做到这一点）。

The other reason that zoning reform is not sufficient is that unless cities are willing to build more infrastructure, upzoning won’t matter.  

分区改革不够充分的另一个原因是，除非城市愿意建设更多的基础设施，否则提高分区并不重要。  

For instance, both Marin County and Santa Barbara in California in the 1970s began rationing water and used the rationed water as a reason for opposing more growth.  

例如，20 世纪 70 年代，加利福尼亚州的马林县和圣巴巴拉县都开始配给水，并以配给水为由反对更多的增长。  

But Marin County had explicitly opposed reservoirs in order to block growth and Santa Barbara had declined to join the California Water Project [in order to prevent resulting development](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674753884). Although courts can and have forced cities to connect new projects to existing infrastructure, they can rarely force further upstream building.   

但马林县明确反对修建水库，以阻止发展，圣巴巴拉拒绝加入加州水项目，以阻止由此带来的发展。虽然法院可以并已经迫使城市将新项目与现有基础设施连接起来，但它们很少能迫使进一步的上游建设。

If an area refuses to build enough water and wastewater treatment facilities, it can’t grow. If a city won’t expand roads or transit, it can’t grow.  

如果一个地区拒绝建设足够的供水和废水处理设施，它就无法发展。如果一个城市不愿意扩建道路或交通设施，它就无法发展。  

If a city can’t provide new and expanded schools, it can’t grow. Once new development pushes up against infrastructure limits, the development will fail, no matter the zoning.  

如果一个城市不能新建和扩建学校，它就无法发展。一旦新的开发项目突破了基础设施的限制，那么无论分区如何，开发项目都将失败。  

Cities need to be partners with the states in building this infrastructure.   

城市需要成为各州的合作伙伴，共同建设这一基础设施。

States should work with the YIMBYs to mandate more density in some areas, especially in areas with large gains from development and sufficient infrastructure, such as central cities.  

各国应与 "YIMBYs "合作，在某些地区，特别是在中心城市等发展收益大、基础设施充足的地区，规定更高的密度。  

And states and courts should limit the most egregious local zoning abuses, such as when cities downzone areas below the density of nearby developed property or create excessively large lot sizes.  

各州和法院应限制最严重的地方分区滥用行为，比如城市将一些地区的分区面积缩小到低于附近已开发房地产的密度，或创造过大的地块面积。  

But unless local governments become part of the growth coalition again, there will be no hope for bringing back what academics once called the local ‘growth machine’.   

但是，除非地方政府再次成为经济增长联盟的一部分，否则就没有希望重现学术界曾称之为地方 "经济增长机器 "的景象。

### **Conclusion  结论**

Although by many measures America still has more affordable housing than most of the developed world, its housing cost crisis is unparalleled in its history.  

尽管从许多方面来看，美国的经济适用房仍然比大多数发达国家要多，但其住房成本危机在历史上却是空前的。  

Almost all agree this is the result of increasingly burdensome regulations in its major urban centers.  

几乎所有人都认为，这是主要城市中心日益繁琐的法规造成的。  

Yet the reason for the explosion of regulations in these places has received less attention than it deserves.  

然而，这些地方规章制度激增的原因却没有得到应有的重视。  

In a decentralized country with almost 20,000 different municipalities, bad policies that hurt local residents should be crowded out.  

在一个拥有近 2 万个不同市镇的权力下放国家，损害当地居民利益的糟糕政策应该被排挤出局。  

Yet such positive competition and local growth is not happening like it was in the past.  

然而，这种积极的竞争和地方增长并没有像过去那样发生。  

Instead of abandoning all local government, which, as other nations have shown, does not lead to increased growth, America should revive its local governments and try to make them partners in growth again.   

其他国家的经验表明，地方政府并不会带来增长，美国与其放弃所有地方政府，不如重振地方政府，让它们再次成为增长的伙伴。

As David Foster and Joseph Warren point out in their article ‘[The NIMBY Problem](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782189)’, making cities more majoritarian, with fewer veto points, can facilitate bargaining between developers and locals and allow more people to share in the gains of growth.  

正如大卫-福斯特和约瑟夫-沃伦在他们的文章 "NIMBY 问题 "中指出的那样，让城市更加多数派化，减少否决点，可以促进开发商和当地居民之间的讨价还价，让更多人分享增长带来的收益。  

Tying such structural changes to fiscal ones and also ensuring that neighborhoods, even if they have less veto power, do not suffer only downsides from growth, can help bring them back into the growth coalition.  

将这种结构性改革与财政改革挂钩，并确保邻里（即使他们的否决权较小）不会只遭受增长带来的不利影响，这有助于将他们重新拉回到增长联盟中来。

The fundamental argument for growth, in cities as in nations, is not that it is costless. There are always costs to growth.  

城市和国家增长的根本原因并不是增长不需要成本。增长总是要付出代价的。  

We always lose things, including things we are attached to. The fundamental argument for growth is that the costs of _not_ growing are even greater.  

我们总会失去一些东西，包括我们眷恋的东西。支持增长的基本论点是，不增长的代价更大。  

We see this in cities today where landholders can’t benefit from sales, where new renters and homebuyers are priced out, and where whole regions are deprived of the workers and dynamism they need.  

今天，我们在城市中看到了这一点：土地持有者无法从销售中获益，新的租房者和购房者被拒之门外，整个地区都失去了他们所需要的工人和活力。  

To put it a slightly different way, the argument for growth is that there are net gains.  

换一种说法，支持增长的理由是有净收益。  

And if there are net gains, trades between the winners and losers can ensure that growth happens.  

如果有净收益，赢家和输家之间的交易就能确保实现增长。

One side-effect of reestablishing the connection between local gains and growth is that it will reestablish the constituency for growth in general.  

重新建立地方收益与增长之间的联系的一个副作用是，它将重新确立总体增长的支持者。

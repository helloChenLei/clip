In April 2022, things were going surprisingly well for [Elon Musk](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk).

[Tesla](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA)

stock had risen 15-fold in five years, making it worth more than the next nine auto companies combined.  

2022 年 4 月，埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 的一切进展出奇地顺利。特斯拉的股价在五年内上涨了 15 倍，其市值超过了紧随其后的九家汽车公司的总和。  

SpaceX in the first quarter of 2022 launched twice as much mass into orbit as all other companies and countries combined.  

SpaceX 在 2022 年第一季度向轨道发射的质量是所有其他公司和国家总和的两倍。  

Its Starlink satellites had just succeeded in creating a privately owned internet, providing connectivity to 500,000 subscribers in 40 countries, including Ukraine.  

其星链卫星刚刚成功创建了一个私有互联网，为包括乌克兰在内的 40 个国家的 50 万用户提供连接。

It promised to be a glorious year, if only Musk could leave well enough alone. But that was not in his nature.  

如果马斯克能够安然度过，那这将是辉煌的一年。但这不是他的本性。

Shivon Zilis, who manages Neuralink (Musk’s company working on implantable brain-computer interfaces) and is the mother of two of his children, noticed that by early April he had the itchiness of a video-game addict who has triumphed but couldn’t unplug.  

Shivon Zilis 是 Neuralink（马斯克的公司，致力于植入式脑机接口）的管理人员，也是他两个孩子的母亲。他注意到，到 4 月初，他就像一个电子游戏成瘾者，虽然取得了胜利，但却无法拔掉插头，感到心痒痒。 。  

“You don’t have to be in a state of war at all times,” she told him that month. “Or is it that you find greater comfort when you’re in periods of war?”  

“你不必一直处于战争状态，”她那个月告诉他。 “或者说，当你处于战争时期时，你会找到更大的安慰吗？”

“It’s part of my default settings,” he replied. As he put it to me, “I guess I’ve always wanted to push my chips back on the table or play the next level of the game.”  

“这是我默认设置的一部分，”他回答道。正如他对我说的，“我想我一直想把筹码推回桌面上，或者玩游戏的下一个级别。”

This period of unnerving success coincided, fatefully, with a moment when he had exercised some expiring stock options that left him with about $10 billion in cash.  

命运般地，这段令人不安的成功时期恰逢他行使了一些即将到期的股票期权，这为他留下了约 100 亿美元的现金。  

“I didn’t want to just leave it in the bank,” he says, “so I asked myself what product I liked, and that was an easy question.  

“我不想把它留在银行，”他说，“所以我问自己我喜欢什么产品，这是一个简单的问题。  

It was Twitter.” That January, he had confidentially told his personal business manager, Jared Birchall, to start buying shares.  

这是推特。”那年一月，他秘密地告诉他的私人业务经理贾里德·伯查尔(Jared Birchall)，开始购买股票。

The way that Musk blustered into [buying Twitter](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-moves-swiftly-to-put-imprint-on-twitter-after-takeover-11666978716?mod=article_inline) and renaming it X was a harbinger of the way he now runs it: impulsively and irreverently. It is an addictive playground for him.  

马斯克气势汹汹地收购 Twitter 并将其重新命名为 X 的方式预示着他现在的运营方式：冲动且不敬。这对他来说是一个令人上瘾的游乐场。  

It has many of the attributes of a school yard, including taunting and bullying.  

它具有校园的许多特征，包括嘲讽和欺凌。  

But in the case of Twitter, the clever kids win followers; they don’t get pushed down the steps and beaten, like Musk was as a kid.  

但就推特而言，聪明的孩子赢得了追随者。他们不会像马斯克小时候那样被推下台阶并挨打。  

Owning it would allow him to become king of the school yard.  

拥有它将使他成为校园之王。

More than two decades earlier he had started a company called X.com, which he wanted to make into an “everything app” that would handle all of a person’s financial transactions and social connections.  

二十多年前，他创办了一家名为 X.com 的公司，他希望将其打造成一款“万能应用程序”，能够处理个人的所有金融交易和社交关系。  

When it merged with a payment service co-founded by Peter Thiel called

[PayPal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PYPL)

, Musk fought furiously to keep X.com as the name of the combined company. His new colleagues resisted.  

当它与 Peter Thiel 共同创立的支付服务公司 PayPal 合并时，马斯克奋力争取保留 X.com 作为合并后公司的名称。他的新同事对此表示抵制。  

PayPal had become a trusted brand name, with a friendly chirpiness similar to that of Twitter, whereas the name X.com conjured up visions of a seedy site you would not talk about in polite company.  

PayPal 已经成为一个值得信赖的品牌名称，带有类似于 Twitter 的友好快活，而 X.com 这个名字则让人联想到一个你不会在有礼貌的公司里谈论的肮脏网站。  

Musk was ousted, and he remains unwavering to this day. “If you want to just be a niche player, PayPal is a better name,” he says.  

马斯克被赶下台，但他至今仍坚定不移。 “如果你只想成为一个小众玩家，PayPal 是一个更好的名字，”他说。  

“But if you want to take over the world’s financial system, then X is the better name.”  

“但如果你想接管世界金融体系，那么 X 是更好的名字。”

By the time he started buying its shares, Musk saw Twitter, whose name he likewise felt was too niche and precious, as a way to fulfill his [original concept](https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-app-musk-spiegel-dorsey-11657306485?mod=article_inline). “Twitter could become what X.com should have been,” he told me that April, “and we can help save free speech in the process.”  

当他开始购买 Twitter 股票时，马斯克将 Twitter（他同样觉得这个名字太小众和珍贵）视为实现他最初想法的一种方式。 “Twitter 可能会成为 X.com 应该成为的样子，”他那年 4 月告诉我，“我们可以在这个过程中帮助拯救言论自由。”

> ‘Unless the woke mind virus…is stopped, civilization will never become multiplanetary,” Musk said gravely.  
> 
> “除非唤醒心灵病毒……被阻止，文明永远不会成为多行星的，”马斯克严肃地说。

By then, a new ingredient had been added to this cauldron: Musk’s swelling concern with the dangers of what he called the “woke mind virus” that he believed was infecting America.  

那时，一个新的成分已经被添加到这个大锅中：马斯克对他所谓的“清醒病毒”的危险日益担忧，他认为这种病毒正在感染美国。  

“Unless the woke mind virus, which is fundamentally anti-science, anti-merit, and anti-human in general, is stopped, civilization will never become multiplanetary,” he told me gravely.  

“除非停止从根本上反科学、反道德和反人类的觉醒病毒，否则文明永远不会成为多行星的，”他严肃地告诉我。

Musk’s anti-woke sentiments were partly triggered by the decision of his oldest child, Xavier, then 16, to transition.  

马斯克的反觉醒情绪部分是由他最大的孩子泽维尔（Xavier）（当时 16 岁）决定变性引发的。  

“Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna,” she texted the wife of Elon’s brother.  

“嘿，我是变性人，我现在的名字是珍娜，”她给埃隆兄弟的妻子发短信。  

“Don’t tell my dad.” When Musk found out, he was generally sanguine, but then Jenna became a fervent Marxist and broke off all relations with him.  

“别告诉我爸爸。”当马斯克发现后，他总体上很乐观，但后来詹娜变成了一名狂热的马克思主义者，并与他断绝了所有关系。  

“She went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,” he says.  

“她超越了社会主义，成为了一名彻底的共产主义者，并认为任何富有的人都是邪恶的，”他说。  

The rift pained him more than anything in his life since the infant death of his firstborn child Nevada.  

自从他的长子内华达婴儿去世以来，这种裂痕对他来说是人生中最痛苦的事情。  

“I’ve made many overtures,” he says, “but she doesn’t want to spend time with me.”  

“我已经提出了很多建议，”他说，“但她不想和我共度时光。”

He blamed it partly on the ideology he felt that Jenna imbibed at Crossroads, the progressive school she attended in Los Angeles.  

他将其部分归咎于詹娜在她就读于洛杉矶的一所进步学校十字路口学校所吸收的意识形态。  

Twitter, he felt, had become infected by a similar mindset that suppressed right-wing and anti-establishment voices.  

他认为，推特已经受到类似压制右翼和反建制声音的心态的影响。

### **‘What Twitter needs is a fire-breathing dragon.’  

“推特需要的是一条喷火龙。”**

One night after it became public that he was buying Twitter stock, Musk called Parag Agrawal, the software engineer who had taken over from Jack Dorsey as Twitter’s CEO. They decided to meet secretly for dinner on March 31, along with Twitter’s board chair Bret Taylor.  

在他购买 Twitter 股票的消息公开后的一天晚上，马斯克给帕拉格·阿格拉瓦尔 (Parag Agrawal) 打电话，他是一位软件工程师，接替了杰克·多尔西 (Jack Dorsey) 担任 Twitter 首席执行官。他们决定于 3 月 31 日与 Twitter 董事会主席 Bret Taylor 秘密会面共进晚餐。

Musk found Agrawal to be likable. “He’s a really nice guy,” he says. But that was the problem. If you ask Musk what traits a CEO needs, he would not include being a really nice guy.  

马斯克发现阿格拉瓦尔很讨人喜欢。 “他是一个非常好的人，”他说。但这就是问题所在。如果你问马斯克首席执行官需要什么特质，他不会包括成为一个真正的好人。  

One of his maxims is that managers should not aim to be liked. “What Twitter needs is a fire-breathing dragon,” he said after that meeting, “and Parag is not that.”  

他的格言之一是管理者不应以讨人喜欢为目标。 “Twitter 需要的是一条喷火龙，”他在那次会议后说道，“而 Parag 不是那样。”

Musk hadn’t yet thought about taking over Twitter himself. At their meeting, Agrawal invited him to join Twitter’s board, and he agreed.  

马斯克还没有想过亲自接管 Twitter。在他们的会面中，阿格拉瓦尔邀请他加入 Twitter 董事会，他同意了。  

For a brief couple of days, it looked as if there would be peace in the valley.  

短短几天，山谷里似乎一片平静。

Luke Nosek and Ken Howery, Musk’s close friends and fellow PayPal cofounders, paced around the mezzanine workspace of the Tesla factory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, on the afternoon of April 6, the day after the announcement that he was joining the Twitter board.  

4 月 6 日下午，也就是马斯克宣布加入 Twitter 董事会的第二天，卢克·诺塞克 (Luke Nosek) 和肯·豪厄里 (Ken Howery) 是马斯克的密友，也是 PayPal 的联合创始人，他们在德克萨斯州奥斯汀特斯拉工厂和总部的夹层工作区里来回踱步。  

They were wary. “It’s probably a recipe for trouble,” Musk merrily conceded as he sat down at a conference table overlooking the assembly lines.  

他们很警惕。 “这可能会引发麻烦，”马斯克在俯瞰装配线的会议桌旁坐下来，高兴地承认。  

“It’s very clear that the inmates are running the asylum,” he said of Twitter’s workers.  

“很明显，收容所是由囚犯管理的，”他谈到 Twitter 的工作人员时说道。

He repeated his simple view that it would be good for democracy if Twitter stopped trying to restrict what users could say.  

他重申了他的简单观点，即如果 Twitter 停止试图限制用户的言论，这将有利于民主。  

Despite sharing Musk’s libertarian views on free speech, Howery pushed back gently.  

尽管豪厄里赞同马斯克对言论自由的自由主义观点，但他还是温和地反驳了这一观点。  

“Should it be like a telephone system, where the words that go in one end come out exactly the same on the other end?” he asked.  

“它是否应该像电话系统一样，一端输入的内容在另一端输出的结果完全相同？”他问。  

“Or do you think this is more like a system that is governing the discourse of the world, and maybe there should be some intelligence put into the algorithm that prioritizes and deprioritizes things?”  

“或者你认为这更像是一个管理世界话语的系统，也许应该在算法中加入一些智能，以区分事物的优先级和降低优先级？”

“Yeah, it’s a thorny question,” Musk answered.  

“是的，这是一个棘手的问题，”马斯克回答道。  

“There’s an ability to say something, and then there is also the issue of to what degree it’s promoted or amplified.” Perhaps the formula for promoting tweets should be more open.  

“有一种表达能力，然后还有一个问题是它被提升或放大到什么程度。”也许推广推文的方式应该更加开放。  

“It could be an open-source algorithm placed on GitHub so people can sift through it.”  

“它可能是放在 GitHub 上的开源算法，这样人们就可以对其进行筛选。”

> ‘It could fulfill my original vision for X.com and PayPal,’ Musk said with a gleeful laugh.  
> 
> “它可以实现我对 X.com 和 PayPal 的最初愿景，”马斯克笑着说道。

Musk then threw out a few other ideas. “What if we charged people a small amount, like two dollars a month, to be verified?” he asked.  

随后马斯克抛出了一些其他想法。 “如果我们向人们收取少量费用，例如每月两美元，以进行验证会怎么样？”他问。  

Getting a user’s credit card, he said, would eliminate bots, provide a new revenue stream and facilitate his goal of turning Twitter into a payments platform, like he had envisioned for X.com, where people could send money, hand out tips and pay for stories, music and videos.  

他说，获得用户的信用卡将消除机器人，提供新的收入来源，并促进他将 Twitter 转变为支付平台的目标，就像他对 X.com 的设想一样，人们可以在其中汇款、分发小费和付款用于故事、音乐和视频。  

Because Howery and Nosek had been with Musk at PayPal, they liked the idea. “It could fulfill my original vision for X.com and PayPal,” Musk said with a gleeful laugh.  

因为豪厄里和诺塞克曾在 PayPal 与马斯克一起工作，所以他们喜欢这个想法。 “它可以实现我对 X.com 和 PayPal 的最初愿景，”马斯克笑着说道。

His brother Kimbal told him over lunch the next day that it would be better to start a new social-media platform based on the blockchain. Musk was intrigued and got into giddy mode.  

第二天，他的兄弟 Kimbal 在午餐时告诉他，最好启动一个基于区块链的新社交媒体平台。马斯克对此很感兴趣，并进入了令人眼花缭乱的状态。  

Perhaps, he said half-jokingly, it could have a payment system using Dogecoin, the semi-serious cryptocurrency whose development he had been quietly funding.  

他半开玩笑地说，也许它可以有一个使用狗狗币的支付系统，狗狗币是一种半严肃的加密货币，他一直在悄悄资助其开发。  

After lunch, he sent Kimbal a few texts fleshing out the idea for “a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages like Twitter.”  

午餐后，他给 Kimbal 发了几条短信，详细阐述了“一个既能进行支付，又能像 Twitter 一样进行短短信的区块链社交媒体系统”的想法。

He then flew to Larry Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lanai. He had planned the trip as a quiet rendezvous with one of the women he was occasionally dating, the Australian actress Natasha Bassett.  

然后他飞往拉里·埃里森的夏威夷岛拉奈岛。他计划这次旅行是为了与他偶尔约会的一位女性——澳大利亚女演员娜塔莎·巴塞特（Natasha Bassett）进行一次安静的约会。  

But instead of using it as a relaxed mini-vacation, he spent his four days there figuring out what to do about Twitter.  

但他并没有把它当作一个轻松的迷你假期，而是花了四天时间思考如何处理 Twitter。

He stayed awake most of his first night stewing about the problems Twitter faced. When he looked at a list of users who had the most followers, they were no longer very active.  

他第一天晚上的大部分时间都睡不着，对推特面临的问题感到烦恼。当他查看拥有最多关注者的用户列表时，发现他们不再非常活跃。  

So at 3:32 a.m. Hawaii time, he posted a tweet: “Most of these ‘top’ accounts tweet rarely and post very little content. Is Twitter dying?”  

因此，在夏威夷时间凌晨 3 点 32 分，他发布了一条推文：“大多数‘顶级’账户很少发推文，发布的内容也很少。推特快要死了吗？”

About 90 minutes later, Twitter CEO Agrawal sent Musk a text message: “You are free to tweet ‘Is twitter dying?’ or anything else about Twitter, but it’s my responsibility to tell you that it’s not helping me make Twitter better in the current context.” It was a restrained text, carefully worded to avoid implying that Musk no longer had the right to disparage the company.  

大约 90 分钟后，Twitter 首席执行官阿格拉瓦尔给马斯克发了一条短信：“你可以自由地发推文‘Twitter 正在消亡吗？’或任何其他有关 Twitter 的内容，但我有责任告诉你，这并不能帮助我在当前的情况下让 Twitter 变得更好。”语境。”这是一篇克制的文字，措辞谨慎，以避免暗示马斯克不再有权贬低该公司。

When Musk got the text, it was just after 5 a.m. in Hawaii, but he was still going strong.  

当马斯克收到短信时，时间是夏威夷凌晨 5 点刚过，但他仍然精神抖擞。  

He shot back a scathing reply: “What did you get done this week?” It was the ultimate Musk put-down.  

他严厉地回击道：“你这周做了什么？”这是对马斯克的终极贬低。

Then he texted back a fateful three-shot volley: “I’m not joining the board. This is a waste of time. Will make an offer to take Twitter private.”  

然后他发短信回了一个致命的三击截击：“我不会加入董事会。这是浪费时间。将提出将 Twitter 私有化的提议。”

Agrawal was shocked. “Can we talk?” he asked plaintively.  

阿格拉瓦尔震惊了。 “我们可以谈谈吗？”他哀怨地问道。

Within three minutes, Taylor, the Twitter board chair, texted Musk with a similar plea to talk. “Do you have five minutes so I can understand the context?” he asked Musk.  

三分钟之内，推特董事会主席泰勒给马斯克发短信，请求进行类似的谈话。 “你能给我五分钟时间让我了解一下上下文吗？”他问马斯克。

“Fixing Twitter by chatting with Parag won’t work,” Musk answered. “Drastic action is needed.”  

“通过与 Parag 聊天来修复 Twitter 是行不通的，”马斯克回答道。 “需要采取严厉行动。”

### ‘I made an offer.’“我提出了要约。”

Musk says that it became clear to him when he got to Hawaii that he would not be able to fix Twitter or turn it into X.com by going on the board: “I decided I didn’t want to be co-opted and be some sort of quisling on the board.” There was one other factor.  

马斯克表示，当他到达夏威夷时，他清楚地意识到，他将无法通过加入董事会来修复 Twitter 或将其转变为 X.com：“我决定不想被拉拢并成为董事会成员。”董事会上有某种卖淫行为。”还有另一个因素。  

Musk was in a manic mood, and he was acting impetuously.  

马斯克情绪狂躁，行事浮躁。

As was often the case, his ideas fluctuated wildly with his [mood swings](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-x-twitter-latest-antics-b52c5ba4?mod=article_inline). Even as he was barreling toward buying Twitter, he was texting with Kimbal about their idea of starting a new social-media company.  

与往常一样，他的想法随着情绪的波动而剧烈波动。就在他极力收购 Twitter 的同时，他也在与 Kimbal 发短信讨论他们创办一家新社交媒体公司的想法。  

“I think a new social-media company is needed that is based on the blockchain and includes payments,” he wrote.  

“我认为需要一家基于区块链并包含支付功能的新社交媒体公司，”他写道。

But by later that afternoon—Saturday, April 9—he had embraced the idea of buying Twitter. “It already has a base of users,” he told me.  

但到了那天下午晚些时候（4 月 9 日星期六），他接受了收购 Twitter 的想法。 “它已经有了一定的用户基础，”他告诉我。  

“You need that booster to launch X.com.” He sent a text to Birchall. “This is real,” he assured him. “There is no way to fix the company as a 9% shareholder.”  

“你需要这个助推器来启动 X.com。”他给伯查尔发了一条短信。 “这是真的，”他向他保证。 “没有办法让公司固定为9%的股东。”

In late July, Elon Musk shifted Twitter’s name to X, a major change for the brand. But it’s not the first time the tech billionaire has used the URL x.com.  

7 月下旬，埃隆·马斯克将 Twitter 的名称改为 X，这是该品牌的重大变化。但这并不是这位科技亿万富翁第一次使用 URL x.com。  

WSJ explains what the site’s past could signal about its future.  

《华尔街日报》解释了该网站的过去可能预示着其未来。

Musk then flew to Vancouver to meet his on-and-off girlfriend Claire Boucher, the performance artist known as Grimes.  

随后，马斯克飞往温哥华会见他时断时续的女友克莱尔·鲍彻（Claire Boucher），她是一位被称为“格莱姆斯”的表演艺术家。  

She had been pushing him to go there so that she could introduce their son X (yes, X) to her parents and aging grandparents.  

她一直催促他去那里，以便她可以将他们的儿子X（是的，X）介绍给她的父母和年迈的祖父母。  

But when it came time to drive to see her parents, she decided to leave Musk back in the hotel. “I could tell that he was in stress mode,” she says.  

但当她要开车去看父母时，她决定把马斯克留在酒店。 “我看得出来他正处于压力模式，”她说。

Indeed he was. Late that afternoon, Musk texted Taylor his official decision.  

确实如此。当天下午晚些时候，马斯克向泰勒发短信表示了他的正式决定。  

“After several days of deliberation—this is obviously a matter of serious gravity—I have decided to move forward with taking Twitter private,” he said.  

“经过几天的深思熟虑——这显然是一个严重的问题——我决定继续将 Twitter 私有化，”他说。

That night, after Grimes returned to their hotel, he unwound by immersing himself in a new video game, “Elden Ring,” which he had downloaded onto his laptop.  

那天晚上，格莱姆斯回到酒店后，他沉浸在一款新的视频游戏“Elden Ring”中放松自己，他把这款游戏下载到了笔记本电脑上。  

Elaborately rendered with cryptic clues and strange plot twists, it requires intense focus, especially when it comes to calculating when to attack.  

精心渲染了神秘的线索和奇怪的情节曲折，它需要高度集中注意力，尤其是在计算何时攻击时。  

He spent a lot of time in the game’s most dangerous regions, a fiery-red hellscape known as Caelid. “Instead of sleeping,” Grimes said, “he played until 5:30 in the morning.”  

他花了很多时间在游戏中最危险的区域，一个被称为凯利德的火红色地狱景观。 “他没有睡觉，”格莱姆斯说，“他一直玩到凌晨 5 点 30 分。”

Moments after he finished, he sent out a tweet: “I made an offer.”  

说完后不久，他发了一条推文：“我提出了要约。”

Musk then set about finding outside investors who would help him finance the purchase. He asked Kimbal, who declined. He was more successful with Larry Ellison.  

随后，马斯克开始寻找外部投资者，帮助他为此次收购提供资金。他询问金巴尔，但金巴尔拒绝了。他在拉里·埃里森的带领下取得了更大的成功。  

“Yes, of course,” Ellison had answered when Musk asked earlier in the week if he was interested in investing in the deal.  

“是的，当然，”本周早些时候，当马斯克询问他是否有兴趣投资这笔交易时，埃里森回答道。

“Roughly what dollar size?” Musk asked. “Not holding you to anything, but the deal is oversubscribed, so I have to reduce or kick out some participants.”  

“大约有多少美元？”马斯克问道。 “不要求你做什么，但这笔交易已经超额认购，所以我必须减少或踢出一些参与者。”

“A billion,” said Ellison, “or whatever you recommend.”  

“十亿，”埃里森说，“或者你推荐的任何东西。”

Ellison had not tweeted in a decade. In fact, he could not remember his Twitter password, so Musk had to personally get it reset for him.  

埃里森已经十年没有发推文了。事实上，他不记得自己的 Twitter 密码，因此马斯克必须亲自为他重置密码。  

But Ellison believed that Twitter was important. “It’s a real-time news service, and there’s nothing really like it,” he told me.  

但埃里森认为 Twitter 很重要。 “这是一项实时新闻服务，没有什么比它更好的了，”他告诉我。  

“If you agree it’s important for a democracy, then I thought it was worth making an investment in it.”  

“如果你同意这对民主很重要，那么我认为值得对其进行投资。”

### **‘My bullshit detector went off like red alert.’  

“我的废话探测器就像红色警报一样响起。”**

One person who was [eager to be in the deal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rich-famous-and-in-between-vie-for-elon-musks-attention-11664574552?mod=article_inline) was Sam Bankman-Fried, the soon-to-be-disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Musk’s

[Morgan Stanley](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS)

banker urged him to call Bankman-Fried, saying that he “would do the engineering for social media blockchain integration” and put $5 billion in the deal.  

Sam Bankman-Fried 是一位渴望参与这笔交易的人，他是加密货币交易所 FTX 的创始人，他很快就名誉扫地。马斯克的摩根士丹利银行家敦促他致电班克曼-弗里德，称他“将为社交媒体区块链整合进行工程”，并在交易中投入 50 亿美元。

Despite having kicked around with Kimbal the idea of building a social network on the blockchain, Musk felt that this approach would be too sluggish to support fast-paced Twitter postings.  

尽管与 Kimbal 讨论过在区块链上建立社交网络的想法，但马斯克认为这种方法太缓慢，无法支持快节奏的 Twitter 帖子。  

So he had no desire to meet with Bankman-Fried. When his banker persisted by reiterating that Bankman-Fried “could do $5bn,” Musk responded with a “dislike” button.  

所以他不想见班克曼-弗里德。当他的银行家坚持重申班克曼-弗里德“可以做 50 亿美元”时，马斯克用“不喜欢”按钮回应。  

“Blockchain Twitter isn’t possible, as the bandwidth and latency requirements cannot be supported by a peer to peer network.” He said he might at some point meet with Bankman-Fried, “so long as I don’t have to have a laborious blockchain debate.”  

“区块链 Twitter 是不可能的，因为点对点网络无法支持带宽和延迟要求。”他表示，他可能会在某个时候与班克曼-弗里德会面，“只要我不必进行一场艰苦的区块链辩论。”

Bankman-Fried then texted Musk directly to say he was “really excited about what you’ll do with TWTR.” He said he had $100 million of Twitter stock that he’d like to “roll,” meaning that his Twitter stock would be converted into a stake in the new company once Musk took it private.  

随后班克曼-弗里德直接给马斯克发短信说他“对你将用 TWTR 做的事情感到非常兴奋”。他表示，他拥有 1 亿美元的 Twitter 股票，他想“滚动”，这意味着一旦马斯克将其私有化，他的 Twitter 股票将转换为新公司的股份。  

“Sorry, who is sending this message?” Musk texted back. When Bankman-Fried apologized and introduced himself, Musk replied curtly, “You’re welcome to roll.”  

“抱歉，这条消息是谁发的？”马斯克回复了短信。当班克曼-弗里德道歉并自我介绍时，马斯克简短地回答道：“不客气，欢迎加入。”

That led Bankman-Fried to call Musk in May. “My bullshit detector went off like red alert on a Geiger counter,” Musk says. Bankman-Fried began talking rapidly, all about himself.  

这导致班克曼-弗里德在五月份给马斯克打电话。 “我的废话探测器就像盖革计数器上的红色警报一样响起，”马斯克说。班克曼-弗里德开始语速很快，全是关于他自己的事情。  

“He was talking like he was on speed or Adderall, a mile a minute,” Musk says.  

“他说话的语气就像是在加速或加得拉，每分钟一英里，”马斯克说。  

“I thought he was supposed to be asking me questions about the deal, but he kept telling me the things he was doing.  

“我以为他应该问我有关这笔交易的问题，但他一直告诉我他正在做的事情。  

And I was thinking, ‘Dude, calm down.’” The feeling was mutual; Bankman-Fried thought Musk seemed nuts.  

我当时想，‘伙计，冷静点。’”这种感觉是相互的；班克曼-弗里德认为马斯克似乎疯了。  

The call lasted a half hour, and Bankman-Fried ended up neither investing nor rolling over his Twitter stock.  

通话持续了半个小时，班克曼-弗里德最终既没有投资也没有展期他的 Twitter 股票。

Musk successfully put together his financing, and the Twitter board accepted his plan at the end of April.  

马斯克成功筹集了资金，Twitter 董事会于 4 月底接受了他的计划。  

Instead of celebrating that night, Musk flew down to his Starbase rocket-launch site in south Texas.  

那天晚上，马斯克没有庆祝，而是飞往德克萨斯州南部的 Starbase 火箭发射场。  

There he participated in the regular nightly meeting on redesigning the Raptor engine and, for more than an hour, wrestled with how to deal with unexplained methane leaks they were experiencing.  

在那里，他参加了关于重新设计猛禽发动机的例行夜间会议，并用了一个多小时的时间来思考如何处理他们遇到的不明原因的甲烷泄漏问题。  

The Twitter news was the burning topic around the world, but the SpaceX engineers knew he liked to stay focused on the task at hand, and no one mentioned it.  

Twitter 上的新闻是全世界最热门的话题，但 SpaceX 的工程师知道他喜欢专注于手头的任务，所以没有人提及这一点。  

Then he met Kimbal at a roadside cafe in Brownsville that featured local musicians.  

然后他在布朗斯维尔的一家路边咖啡馆遇到了金巴尔，那里有当地音乐家。  

They stayed there until 2 a.m., sitting at a table right in front of the bandstand, just listening to the music.  

他们一直待到凌晨两点，坐在演奏台前的一张桌子旁，只是听音乐。

In the months between the deal agreement and the official closing, Musk’s moods fluctuated wildly.  

在交易协议达成和正式成交之间的几个月里，马斯克的情绪波动剧烈。  

“I am very excited about finally implementing X.com as it should have been done, using Twitter as an accelerant!” he texted me at 3:30 one morning.  

“我对最终实现 X.com 感到非常兴奋，就像它应该做的那样，使用 Twitter 作为促进剂！”一天早上 3:30 他给我发短信。  

“And, hopefully, helping democracy and civil discourse while doing so.”  

“并且，希望在此过程中能够帮助民主和公民话语。”

A few days later, he was more somber. “I will need to live at Twitter HQ. This is a super tough situation.  

几天后，他的心情更加阴沉了。 “我需要住在 Twitter 总部。这是一个超级艰难的情况。  

Really bumming me out :( Sleep is difficult.” He was having doubts about taking on such a messy challenge.  

真的让我很沮丧:(睡眠很难。”他对接受如此混乱的挑战感到怀疑。  

“I’ve got a bad habit of biting off more than I can chew,” he admitted in a long talk with me one night. “I think I just need to think about Twitter less.  

“我有一个贪多嚼不烂的坏习惯，”一天晚上他在与我的长谈中承认。 “我想我只需要少考虑 Twitter。  

Even this conversation right now is not time well spent.”  

即使现在这样的谈话也不值得花时间。”

> ‘These people running Twitter are such blockheads and idiots,’ Musk said in September 2022. ‘There are so many things I could fix.’  
> 
> 马斯克在 2022 年 9 月表示，“这些运行 Twitter 的人都是傻瓜和白痴。我可以解决很多问题。”

Revelations from a whistle-blower and others had inflamed his conviction that Twitter had been lying about the number of actual users and that his original offer of $44 billion was too much.  

一名举报人和其他人的爆料让他更加确信 Twitter 在实际用户数量上撒了谎，而且他最初提出的 440 亿美元报价过高。  

He wanted a better deal. Throughout September, he was on the phone with his lawyers three or four times a day.  

他想要更好的交易。整个九月，他每天都要和律师通三四次电话。  

Sometimes he was in an aggressive mood and insisted that they could beat the lawsuit that Twitter had filed in Delaware seeking to force him to go through with his first offer.  

有时他会情绪激动，坚持认为他们可以击败推特在特拉华州提起的诉讼，试图迫使他接受他的第一个提议。  

“They are shitting bricks about the dumpster fire they’re in,” he said of the Twitter board. “I cannot believe that the judge will railroad the deal through.  

“他们正在为自己所处的垃圾箱起火而泼砖，”他在谈到推特董事会时说道。 “我不敢相信法官会顺利通过这笔交易。  

It would not pass muster with the public.”  

它不会通过公众的认可。”

His lawyers finally convinced him that he would lose the case if they took it to trial. It was best just to close the deal on the original terms. By that point Musk had even regained some of his enthusiasm about taking over the company.  

他的律师最终让他相信，如果他们将案子送上法庭，他就会败诉。最好只是按照原来的条款完成交易。到那时，马斯克甚至恢复了一些接管公司的热情。  

“Arguably, I should just pay full price, because these people running Twitter are such blockheads and idiots,” he told me in late September. “The potential is so great.  

“可以说，我应该支付全价，因为这些运行 Twitter 的人都是傻瓜和白痴，”他在 9 月底告诉我。 “潜力是如此巨大。  

There are so many things I could fix.” He agreed to an official closing of the deal in October.  

有很多事情我可以解决。”他同意在十月份正式完成交易。

### **‘All these damn birds have to go.’  

“所有这些该死的鸟都必须离开。”**

Musk scheduled a visit to Twitter in San Francisco for Wednesday, Oct. 26, to poke around and prepare for the official closing of the deal, which was scheduled for that Friday.  

马斯克计划于 10 月 26 日星期三访问旧金山的 Twitter，进行摸索并为原定于周五举行的交易正式完成做准备。  

He seemed amazed as he wandered around the headquarters, which was in a 10-story Art Deco former merchandise mart built in 1937. It had been renovated in a tech-hip style with coffee bars, yoga studio, fitness room and game arcades.  

当他在总部周围闲逛时，他似乎感到很惊讶。总部位于一座建于 1937 年的 10 层装饰艺术风格前商品市场。它经过翻新，采用了科技时尚的风格，设有咖啡吧、瑜伽室、健身房和游戏厅。  

The cavernous ninth-floor cafe served free meals ranging from artisanal hamburgers to vegan salads.  

位于九楼的宽敞咖啡馆提供免费餐点，从手工汉堡到纯素沙拉，应有尽有。  

The signs on the restrooms said “Gender diversity is welcome here,” and as Musk poked through cabinets filled with stashes of Twitter-branded merchandise, he found T-shirts emblazoned with the words “Stay woke,” which he waved around as an example of the mindset that he believed had infected the company.  

洗手间上的标语写着“这里欢迎性别多样性”，当马斯克翻阅堆满 Twitter 品牌商品的柜子时，他发现了印有“保持清醒”字样的 T 恤，他挥舞着这件 T 恤作为例子他认为这种心态已经感染了公司。

Between Twitterland and the Muskverse there was a radical divergence in outlook. Twitter prided itself on being a friendly place where coddling was considered a virtue.  

Twitterland 和 Muskverse 之间的观点存在根本分歧。推特以自己是一个友好的地方而自豪，在这里，溺爱被认为是一种美德。  

“We were definitely very high-empathy, very caring about inclusion and diversity; everyone needs to feel safe here,” says Leslie Berland, who was chief marketing and people officer until she was fired by Musk. The company had instituted a permanent work-from-home option and allowed a mental “day of rest” each month.  

“我们绝对具有高度的同理心，非常关心包容性和多样性；每个人都需要在这里感到安全。”莱斯利·贝兰德 (Leslie Berland) 说道，她在被马斯克解雇之前一直担任首席营销和人事官。该公司制定了永久性的在家工作选项，并允许每个月有一个精神“休息日”。  

One of the commonly used buzzwords at the company was “psychological safety.” Care was taken not to cause discomfort.  

该公司常用的流行语之一是“心理安全”。小心不要引起不适。

Musk let loose a bitter laugh when he heard the phrase “psychological safety.” It made him recoil. He considered it to be the enemy of urgency, progress, orbital velocity. His [preferred buzzword](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-leadership-analysis-extremely-hardcore-11671832630?mod=article_inline) was “hardcore.” Discomfort, he believed, was a good thing. It was a weapon against the scourge of complacency.  

当听到“心理安全”这个词时，马斯克苦笑了一下。这让他退缩了。他认为这是紧迫性、进步、轨道速度的敌人。他最喜欢的流行词是“硬核”。他相信，不舒服是一件好事。这是对抗自满之祸的武器。  

Vacations, work-life balance and days of “mental rest” were not his thing.  

假期、工作与生活的平衡以及“精神休息”的日子不是他的事。

He became amused and then repulsed by how Twitter’s iconic [blue bird logo](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-says-twitter-will-change-its-logo-to-x-5f73c349?mod=article_inline) was plastered everywhere. He is not a chirpy person; he relishes dark and stormy drama rather than chipper and light chattiness.  

他先是觉得好笑，然后又对 Twitter 标志性的蓝鸟标志随处可见感到厌恶。他不是一个活泼的人；他喜欢黑暗和暴风雨般的戏剧，而不是爽快和轻松的闲聊。  

“All these damn birds have to go,” he told a lieutenant.  

“所有这些该死的鸟都必须离开，”他告诉一名中尉。

The closing of the Twitter deal had been scheduled for that Friday. An orderly transition had been scripted for the opening of the stock market that morning.  

推特交易原定于周五完成。当天早上股市开盘时，有序的过渡已经制定好了。  

The money would transfer, the stock would be delisted, and Musk would be in control.  

资金将转移，股票将退市，马斯克将获得控制权。  

That would permit Agrawal and his top Twitter deputies to collect severance and have their stock options vest.  

这将使阿格拉瓦尔和他的推特高级副手能够领取遣散费并获得股票期权。

But Musk decided that he did not want that. On the afternoon before the scheduled close he methodically planned a jiu-jitsu maneuver: He would force a fast close that night.  

但马斯克认为他不希望这样。在预定的收盘前一天下午，他有条不紊地计划了一场柔术演习：他将在当天晚上强制快速收盘。  

If his lawyers and bankers timed everything right, he could fire Agrawal and other top Twitter executives “for cause” before their stock options could vest.  

如果他的律师和银行家把握好一切时机，他就可以在阿格拉瓦尔和其他推特高管的股票期权归属之前“有理由”解雇他们。

It was audacious, even ruthless. But it was justified in Musk’s mind because of his conviction that Twitter’s management had misled him.  

这是大胆的，甚至是残酷的。但马斯克认为这是合理的，因为他坚信 Twitter 的管理层误导了他。  

“There’s a 200-million differential in the cookie jar between closing tonight and doing it tomorrow morning,” he told me late Thursday afternoon in the war room as the plan unfolded.  

“今晚关闭和明天早上做之间，饼干罐里有 2 亿美元的差异，”周四下午晚些时候，当计划展开时，他在作战室告诉我。

At 4:12 p.m. Pacific time, once they had confirmation that the money had transferred, Musk pulled the trigger to close the deal.  

下午 4 点 12 分太平洋时间，一旦他们确认资金已转移，马斯克就扣动扳机完成交易。  

At precisely that moment, his assistant delivered letters of dismissal to Agrawal and his top three officers.  

就在那时，他的助手向阿格拉瓦尔和他手下的三名高级军官递交了解雇信。  

Six minutes later, Musk’s top security officer came down to the second-floor conference room to say that all had been “exited” from the building and their access to email cut off.  

六分钟后，马斯克的高级安全官员来到二楼会议室，表示所有人都已“退出”大楼，并且他们对电子邮件的访问被切断。

The instant email cutoff was part of the plan. Agrawal had his letter of resignation, citing the change of control, ready to send.  

即时切断电子邮件是该计划的一部分。阿格拉瓦尔已经准备好了以控制权变更为由的辞职信。  

But when his Twitter email was cut off, it took him a few minutes to get the document into a Gmail message. By that point, he had already been fired by Musk.  

但当他的 Twitter 电子邮件被切断后，他花了几分钟才将该文档发送到 Gmail 邮件中。那时，他已经被马斯克解雇了。

“He tried to resign,” Musk said.  

“他试图辞职，”马斯克说。

“But we beat him,” his gunslinging lawyer Alex Spiro replied.  

“但我们打败了他，”他的枪手律师亚历克斯·斯皮罗回答道。

1\. You have everything you need except time and space, and that by decluttering you will gain both.  

1.除了时间和空间，你拥有你所需要的一切，而通过整理，你将获得这两样东西。

2\. Charity now begins at the local charity shop. Your possessions are going to those who need it even more than anyone you know.  

2.慈善现在从当地的慈善商店开始。你的财产将捐给那些比你认识的人更需要的人。

3\. Your friends come to visit you, not your best china or towels.  

3.你的朋友来拜访你，而不是你最好的瓷器或毛巾。

4\. Buy things that you actually need. If you can buy them when they are on sale, then good. But blindly buying things that are on sale can lead to clutter.  

4.买你真正需要的东西。如果能在打折时买到，那就再好不过了。但盲目购买打折商品会导致杂乱无章。  

You have enough money to but the things you need when you really need them.  

当你真正需要的时候，你有足够的钱去买你需要的东西。

5\. Don’t try to be perfect. Good enough is perfect. You are a perfectly good person even if you have a messy house.  

5.不要追求完美。足够好就是完美。即使家里很乱，你也是一个完美的人。

6\. Remember that “ no product” will change your life or buy your way to happiness. Remember that your house is a home and not a magazine photo.  

6.记住，"任何产品 "都无法改变你的生活，也无法让你买到幸福。记住，你的房子是一个家，而不是杂志上的照片。

7\. By not buying it you are getting a bargain on decluttering.  

7.不买它，你就在整理中得到了便宜。

8\. Between the internet and the yellow pages you will always be able to find an item again if you change your mind about needing it.  

8.通过互联网和黄页，如果您改变主意不再需要某件物品，您总能再次找到它。

9.  

When you are tempted to take some curb-side treasure or some other rescued item, remember that you will be able to find one, either on the verge, via freecycle, through a friend, or in a shop.  

当你想带走路边的珍宝或其他获救物品时，请记住，你可以在路边、通过免费回收、通过朋友或在商店里找到一件。

10\. When you say, “ I might need that again”, remember, that mostly you won’t find yourself in this situation, and if you do, it is ok to go out and buy it again.  

10.当你说 "我可能还需要这个 "时，请记住，大多数情况下你不会遇到这种情况，如果遇到了，再去买也没关系。

11\. You are being environmentally responsible by parting with the things you don’t need responsibly.  

11.负责任地丢弃不需要的东西，就是对环境负责。

12\. To declutter means to get rid of possessions, not just to store them more cleverly. Storing clutter only postpones the problem for another day.  

12.整理意味着摆脱财产，而不仅仅是更巧妙地存放它们。存放杂物只会把问题推迟到下一天解决。

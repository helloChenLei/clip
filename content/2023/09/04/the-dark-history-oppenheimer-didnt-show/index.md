Papà, my dad, told me a story long ago about the uranium that powered the first nuclear bombs. The ones dropped on Hiroshima; the bombs you saw being built in this summer’s dramatic film, _Oppenheimer_. Papà, you see, was born in the Belgian Congo.  

很久以前，我爸爸帕帕告诉过我一个关于铀的故事。在广岛投下的核弹；你在今年夏天的戏剧电影《奥本海默》中看到的正在制造的核弹。你看，爸爸出生在比属刚果。

Earlier this summer, I was invited to a screening of the blockbuster. The film’s director, [Christopher Nolan](https://www.wired.com/story/christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-ai-apocalypse/), was there too.  

今年夏天早些时候，我应邀参加了这部大片的放映活动。影片导演克里斯托弗-诺兰也在现场。  

In a recurring scene, meant to symbolize the inching along of the scientists’ efforts, Oppenheimer fills an empty glass bowl with marbles—first one at a time, then in handfuls.  

在一个反复出现的场景中，奥本海默在一个空玻璃碗里装满了弹珠--先是一颗一颗地装，然后是一把一把地装。  

The marbles represent the amount of uranium that has been successfully mined and refined to power the nuclear reaction.  

这些弹珠代表着已成功开采和提炼的铀的数量，为核反应提供动力。  

The outcome of World War II, and the future of humanity, hinges on who can create that monster first—the Axis or the Allies.  

二战的结局和人类的未来，取决于谁能先创造出那个怪物--轴心国还是同盟国。  

The closer we get to the bomb’s completion, the more marbles go into the bowl.  

越接近炸弹完成，碗里的弹珠就越多。  

But there’s no mention in the film of where two-thirds of that uranium came from: a mine 24 stories deep, now in Congo’s Katanga, a mineral-rich area in the southeast.  

但影片中没有提到三分之二的铀来自哪里：一个 24 层楼深的矿井，现在位于刚果加丹加，一个东南部矿产丰富的地区。

As the marbles steadily filled the bowl onscreen, I kept seeing what was missing: Black miners hauling earth and stone to sort piles of radioactive ore by hand.  

当屏幕上的大理石不断填满碗时，我一直在看缺少了什么：黑人矿工拖着泥土和石头，手工分拣成堆的放射性矿石。

Papà was born in 1946 at Mission Ngi, a tiny Belgian missionary outpost.  

1946 年，Papà 出生在比利时传教士的一个小前哨站--恩吉传教所。  

He told us how, growing up, the Belgians taught the Congolese to worship God; how the Belgians addressed Congolese adults with the informal French _tu_, not the formal _vous;_ how the Belgians said eating with your hands, as Papà did at home, was uncivilized. The Congolese were backward and ancillary to modern life, Papà learned in school. So did I.  

他告诉我们，在他的成长过程中，比利时人是如何教导刚果人崇拜上帝的；比利时人是如何用非正式的法语 tu 而不是正式的 vous 来称呼刚果成年人的；比利时人是如何说，像 Papà 在家里那样用手吃饭是不文明的。Papà 在学校学到，刚果人是落后的，是现代生活的附属品。我也是  

And yet, Papà said, the Congolese were the essential ingredient, the sine qua non, of arguably the [most consequential creation in modern history](https://www.wired.com/story/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-artificial-intelligence/).  

然而，Papà 说，刚果人是现代史上最有影响的创造的基本要素和必要条件。

In 1885, when King Leopold II of Belgium first claimed ownership of this massive stretch of land sitting on the world’s deepest river, smack in the center of Africa, he called it Congo Free State.  

1885 年，当比利时国王利奥波德二世首次宣称对这片位于世界最深河流上、地处非洲中心的大片土地拥有所有权时，他称之为刚果自由邦。  

Of course, life for the roughly 10 to 20 million inhabitants meant surviving violence and a terror state run by the king.  

当然，对于大约 1,000 万到 2,000 万居民来说，生活意味着在暴力和国王管理的恐怖国家中生存。  

Throughout the territory, which was converted into a series of cotton and rubber plantations, the king’s soldiers amputated the forearms of Congolese people who didn’t meet harvesting quotas.  

在整个被改造成一系列棉花和橡胶种植园的领土上，国王的士兵截去了没有达到收获配额的刚果人的前臂。  

King Leopold’s policies drove famine and disease. Millions didn’t make it.  

利奥波德国王的政策引发了饥荒和疾病。数百万人没有活下来。

In 1908, when the Belgian government snatched the territory from the king, “Congo Free State” became the “Belgian Congo.” At that point, writes historian Susan Williams, author of _Spies in the Congo_, the private sector replaced the king as the extractor of Congo’s natural resources. The violence remained.  

1908 年，比利时政府从国王手中夺走了这片领土，"刚果自由邦 "变成了 "比属刚果"。刚果间谍》一书的作者、历史学家苏珊-威廉姆斯（Susan Williams）写道，从那时起，私营部门取代国王成为刚果自然资源的开采者。暴力依然存在。  

What’s more, while the Belgian officials let Christian missionaries begin formally educating kids, they were worried that literate Congolese would overturn the colony.  

此外，虽然比利时官员允许基督教传教士开始正式教育孩子，但他们担心识字的刚果人会推翻殖民地。  

Papà told me how schooling beyond the fifth grade was illegal for most Congolese kids.  

帕帕告诉我，对大多数刚果孩子来说，五年级以上的教育是非法的。  

Papà, to the delight of his own father, would chance into one of the colony’s exceptions—education for those who would become priests—an opportunity even some of Papà’s elder siblings wouldn’t have.  

令帕帕父亲高兴的是，他将有机会成为殖民地的例外之一--成为牧师的人可以接受教育--这甚至是帕帕的一些哥哥姐姐都没有的机会。

The colonial system built workers—or borderline enslaved people—not scholars.  

殖民制度培养的是工人，或者说是边缘奴隶，而不是学者。  

An American officer who traveled to the Belgian Congo described a scene he saw on his first day: A Congolese man in ragged shorts knelt on the ground, a Belgian officer towering over him with a chicote, a leather whip tipped with metal ends.  

一名前往比属刚果的美国军官描述了他第一天看到的一幕：一名穿着破旧短裤的刚果人跪在地上，一名比利时军官手持一根皮鞭（chicote），皮鞭的末端是金属。

“The whip whistled … Every lash was followed by a scream of agony … The black’s skin from neck to waist was a mass of blood with ribs shining through.” This, the American reported, was punishment for stealing a pack of cigarettes from a Belgian.

  

"鞭子呼啸着......每抽一鞭，都伴随着一声痛苦的惨叫......黑人从脖子到腰部的皮肤上都是血，肋骨闪闪发光"。据美国人报道，这是对他偷窃比利时人一包香烟的惩罚。  

“Welcome to the Congo,” the American was told.  

"美国人被告知："欢迎来到刚果。

The largest company in the Belgian Congo was the mining company Union-Minière du Haut-Katanga.  

比属刚果最大的公司是 Union-Minière du Haut-Katanga 采矿公司。  

The colonial government had granted it the rights to an area spanning nearly 8,000 square miles, over half the size of Belgium.  

殖民地政府授予了它近 8000 平方英里的土地使用权，超过比利时面积的一半。  

One of the mines there, Shinkolobwe, was rich with uranium. In fact, it was filled with uranium that the Congolese had already excavated and placed aboveground.  

那里的一个矿场--Shinkolobwe--盛产铀。事实上，里面装满了刚果人已经挖掘出来并放置在地面上的铀。  

Initially, uranium was just a waste byproduct of digging for the more valuable radium, which Nobel-prize winner Marie Curie had helped discover could treat cancer.  

最初，铀只是挖掘更有价值的镭时产生的副产品，诺贝尔奖获得者玛丽-居里曾帮助发现镭可以治疗癌症。  

In 1938, using uranium, [the physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200712/physicshistory.cfm) worked out the calculations that defined nuclear fission. If enough nuclei were split, scientists realized, massive amounts of energy could be emitted. Uranium was now coveted.  

1938 年，物理学家 Lise Meitner 和 Otto Frisch 利用铀进行计算，确定了核裂变的定义。科学家们意识到，如果有足够多的原子核分裂，就能释放出巨大的能量。现在，铀成了人们梦寐以求的东西。

In 1939, just before the start of World War II, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin D.  

1939 年，就在第二次世界大战开始之前，阿尔伯特-爱因斯坦给美国总统富兰克林-D.  

Roosevelt with a muted warning: “The element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future … It is conceivable … that extremely powerful bombs of this type may thus be constructed.” Einstein’s letter mentioned four known uranium sources: the United States, which “has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities”; Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, where “there is some good ore”; and Congo—“the most important source of uranium.” According to Jean Bele, a Congolese nuclear physicist at MIT, 100 kilograms of Congolese uranium ore could yield about 1 kilogram of refined uranium.  

罗斯福发出了低沉的警告："在不久的将来，铀元素可能会变成一种新的重要能源......可以想象......这种类型的威力极大的炸弹可能会因此被制造出来"。爱因斯坦在信中提到了四个已知的铀矿来源：美国，"只有非常贫瘠的铀矿石，数量适中"；加拿大和前捷克斯洛伐克，"有一些优质矿石"；以及刚果--"最重要的铀矿来源"。麻省理工学院的刚果核物理学家让-贝勒认为，100 公斤刚果铀矿石可以生产大约 1 公斤精炼铀。  

The same amount of ore from the other locations would yield only 2 or 3 grams of the refined uranium necessary for such a weapon.  

从其他地方开采同样数量的矿石，只能生产出 2 或 3 克这种武器所需的精炼铀。

The mining company typically built fenced-in compounds that resembled prison camps for the workers and their families; the company initially gave each family about 43 square feet—the size of a small garage—and weekly food rations.  

矿业公司通常为工人及其家人建造类似于监狱的围墙大院；公司最初为每个家庭提供大约 43 平方英尺（相当于一个小车库的大小）的空间和每周配给的食物。  

At work, miners sorted uranium ore by hand.  

在工作中，矿工们用手分拣铀矿石。  

One person described a piece of Shinkolobwe uranium as a block “as big as a pig.” It was “black and gold and looked as if it were covered with a green scum or moss.” He called them “flamboyant stones.”  

有人将一块新科罗布韦铀描述为 "像猪一样大 "的块状物。它是 "黑色和金色的，看起来就像覆盖着一层绿色的浮渣或苔藓"。他称之为 "艳丽的石头"。

The director of Union-Minière du Haut-Katanga was Edgar Sengier, a pale Belgian man with a sharply cut mustache.  

Union-Minière du Haut-Katanga 的负责人是埃德加-森吉耶（Edgar Sengier），他是一个面色苍白、留着利落小胡子的比利时人。  

Having seen Germany invade Belgium in World War I, Sengier was unsure about what Hitler’s invasion of Poland in September 1939 foretold.  

森吉耶目睹了德国在第一次世界大战中入侵比利时，他不确定希特勒在 1939 年 9 月入侵波兰预示着什么。  

Would Belgium—or even the African colonies—be next? So in October, he fled Belgium for New York City and transferred the mining company’s business operations there.  

下一个会是比利时，甚至是非洲殖民地吗？于是，10 月，他从比利时逃到纽约，并将矿业公司的业务转移到那里。  

However, before he had set up shop, a British chemist and the Nobel Prize–winning scientist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, son-in-law of Marie Curie, tipped off Sengier that the uranium in Congo might become essential in the war.  

然而，在他开店之前，一位英国化学家、诺贝尔奖获得者、科学家弗雷德里克-约里奥-居里（玛丽-居里的女婿）向森吉埃透露，刚果的铀可能会成为战争中的必需品。

The next fall, Sengier ordered that it be shipped to New York.

  

第二年秋天，森吉耶下令将其运往纽约。

So Congolese workers carried and loaded the ore.  

于是，刚果工人搬运和装载矿石。  

It was sent by train to Port Francqui (now Ilebo), then by boat down the Kasai and Congo Rivers to the capital, Leopoldville (now Kinshasa).  

它被火车运往弗朗基港（今伊莱博），然后乘船沿开赛河和刚果河到达首都利奥波德维尔（今金沙萨）。  

At the port of Matadi, the uranium began its trek across the Atlantic Ocean, past German U-boats, to a warehouse on Staten Island.  

在马塔迪港，铀开始穿越大西洋，经过德国 U 型潜艇，运往斯塔滕岛的一个仓库。  

Sengier stored more than 2.6 million pounds of ore in the States. About 6.6 million pounds remained in Shinkolobwe.  

森吉尔在美国储存了超过 260 万磅的矿石。约有 660 万磅矿石仍存放在 Shinkolobwe。

In May 1940, Hitler invaded France and Belgium. The Belgian government fled to London, and the Third Reich installed a pro-Nazi government in Belgium.  

1940 年 5 月，希特勒入侵法国和比利时。比利时政府逃往伦敦，第三帝国在比利时建立了亲纳粹的政府。  

The governor-general of the Belgian Congo, however, declared that the colony would support the Allies.  

然而，比属刚果总督宣布该殖民地将支持盟军。  

He drafted troops, offered up Congolese laborers, and created production quotas to supply the Allies with necessary war materials.  

他征召部队，提供刚果劳工，制定生产配额，为盟军提供必要的战争物资。  

And so, during the war, many Congolese returned to the very forests where their parents and grandparents had had their hands amputated, ordered to cull rubber again, this time for hundreds of thousands of military tires.  

因此，在战争期间，许多刚果人回到了他们的父母和祖父母曾被截去双手的森林，奉命再次砍伐橡胶，这次是为了生产数十万个军用轮胎。  

As the war ramped up, Congolese miners also dug for minerals like copper in around-the-clock shifts.  

随着战争的加剧，刚果矿工也在昼夜不停地挖掘铜等矿产。

In Sengier’s mining towns, as elsewhere, the Congolese were unable to move freely without permits. Or to vote. Workers had to be home by 9 pm, lest they suffer harsh consequences.  

和其他地方一样，在森吉耶的矿区，刚果人没有许可证就无法自由行动。也不能投票。工人们必须在晚上九点前回家，否则就会遭受严厉的惩罚。  

Pay was terrible.  工资很低。  

But by 1941, though “natives” were excluded from unions, Black workers at several of Sengier’s mines began organizing for higher wages and better labor conditions.  

但到了 1941 年，尽管 "本地人 "被排除在工会之外，森吉耶旗下几个矿场的黑人工人开始组织起来，争取更高的工资和更好的劳动条件。

December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor Day, was not only a pivotal day in the course of the war, but also in the lives of the Congolese mine workers.  

1941 年 12 月 7 日是珍珠港日，这一天不仅是战争进程中的关键一天，也是刚果矿工生活中的关键一天。  

That day, Sengier’s Black employees organized a massive mining strike across Katanga. In Elisabethville, 500 workers refused to start their shifts.  

当天，森吉尔公司的黑人员工在加丹加各地组织了一场大规模的采矿罢工。在伊丽莎白维尔，500 名工人拒绝上岗。  

Soon, freshly off-duty miners joined them and assembled in front of management’s offices, demanding a raise. They won an agreement that they could come bargain the next day.  

很快，刚下班的矿工们也加入了他们的行列，聚集在管理层办公室前，要求加薪。他们赢得了第二天可以来讨价还价的协议。

The next morning, the mine workers showed up to the local soccer stadium to negotiate with Sengier’s company and the colonial governor of Katanga.  

第二天一早，矿工们来到当地的足球场，与森吉耶的公司和加丹加殖民总督进行谈判。  

According to conflicting reports, between 800 and 2,000 strikers attended. The company offered a verbal agreement to raise wages.  

根据相互矛盾的报道，有 800 到 2000 名罢工者参加了会议。公司口头同意提高工资。  

One historian describes it as the “first open expression of open protest in the social history of the Congo.” But when a Congolese worker named Léonard Mpoyi demanded written confirmation of the wage raise, the colonial governor insisted the crowd go home.  

一位历史学家将其描述为 "刚果社会历史上第一次公开表达的公开抗议"。但是，当一位名叫莱昂纳尔-姆波伊（Léonard Mpoyi）的刚果工人要求书面确认加薪时，殖民总督却坚持让群众回家。

“I refuse,” Mpoyi said. “You must give us some proof that the company has agreed to raise our salaries.”  

"我拒绝，"姆波伊说。"你必须给我们一些证据，证明公司已经同意提高我们的工资"。

“I have already demanded that you go to the office to check,” replied the governor, Amour Marron. He then pulled a gun from his pocket and shot Mpoyi, point blank.  

"省长阿穆尔-马龙回答说："我已经要求你去办公室检查。随后，他从口袋里掏出一把枪，对准姆波伊开了一枪。  

Soldiers opened fire “from all directions.” The mine workers poured out of the stadium. Roughly 70 people died. About 100 were injured.  

士兵们 "从四面八方 "开火。矿工们涌出体育场。大约70人死亡约 100 人受伤。

The next morning, a company loudspeaker summoned everyone back to work.  

第二天一早，公司的扩音器就召唤大家回去上班。

About a year after Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt assigned General Leslie Groves to head the Manhattan Project.  

珍珠港事件大约一年后，罗斯福总统指派莱斯利-格罗夫斯将军领导曼哈顿项目。  

On his first day, in September 1942, Groves and his deputy, Colonel Kenneth Nichols, talked about how to procure the necessary uranium for the massive project.  

1942 年 9 月，格罗夫斯上任第一天就和他的副手肯尼思-尼科尔斯上校讨论了如何为这个庞大的项目采购必要的铀。  

Nichols told Groves about Sengier, and his uranium.  

尼科尔斯向格罗夫斯讲述了森吉尔和他的铀矿。  

The next morning, Nichols met Sengier in his New York office, and by the end of the meeting they struck a deal on a yellow legal pad.  

第二天上午，尼科尔斯在纽约的办公室与森吉尔会面，会面结束后，他们在一张黄色的法律便笺上达成了协议。  

“I want to start hauling the uranium away tomorrow,” Nichols declared. Less than a month later, Groves hired J. Robert Oppenheimer to build the bomb.  

"我想明天就开始把铀运走，"尼科尔斯宣布。不到一个月后，格罗夫斯聘请罗伯特-奥本海默制造原子弹。

Over the next couple years, the Congo became a hotbed for American spies—under the cover of “consulate officer,” “Texaco employee,” a “buyer of silks,” and “live gorilla collector”—there to secure the flow of uranium.  

在接下来的几年里，刚果成了美国间谍的温床--他们以 "领事馆官员"、"德士古员工"、"丝绸买家 "和 "活大猩猩收藏家 "为掩护，在那里确保铀的流通。  

General Groves insisted that the US gain complete control of Shinkolobwe and recommended to President Roosevelt that the mine be reopened.  

格罗夫斯将军坚持要求美国完全控制欣克罗布韦，并向罗斯福总统建议重新开放该矿。  

The Army Corps of Engineers was sent to the Congo to start up mining operations anew. The mine’s location was scrubbed from maps.  

陆军工兵团被派往刚果重新开始采矿作业。矿场的位置被从地图上抹去。  

Spies were told to eliminate the word “uranium” from their conversations; rather, advisers added, use words like “diamonds.” The company’s miners also began mining for other war-necessary minerals, toiling in sweat by day, and with immense furnaces by night, swarmed by the sound of trains or planes from America.  

间谍们被告知在谈话中不要用 "铀 "这个词；顾问们补充说，最好用 "钻石 "之类的词。公司的矿工们也开始开采其他战争所需的矿产，他们白天挥汗如雨，晚上在巨大的熔炉中劳作，来自美国的火车或飞机的轰鸣声不绝于耳。  

By then, thanks to the mining strike, worker salaries had risen by 30 to 50 percent. Still, some men were forcibly required to mine.  

当时，由于采矿罢工，工人的工资上涨了 30% 至 50%。但仍有一些人被强制要求采矿。  

From 1938 to 1944, fatal accidents at the company’s plants almost doubled.  

从 1938 年到 1944 年，公司工厂的致命事故几乎翻了一番。  

To avoid rubber quotas, people fled the rural areas for cities like Elisabethville, whose African population swelled from 26,000 in 1940 to 65,000 in 1945.  

为了躲避橡胶配额，人们纷纷逃离农村地区，前往伊丽莎白维尔等城市，那里的非洲裔人口从 1940 年的 26,000 人激增到 1945 年的 65,000 人。

The US government was also worried about Nazi spies. One American spy was tasked with figuring out if Nazis were smuggling Shinkolobwe uranium.  

美国政府还担心纳粹间谍。一名美国间谍的任务是查明纳粹是否在走私新科罗布韦铀。  

Among Sengier’s many shipments of ore, one was intercepted and sunk by the Nazis.  

在森吉耶多次运送的矿石中，有一批被纳粹截获并击沉。

When they arrived in the US, the flamboyant stones were refined in places like Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then shipped to Oppenheimer in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  

到达美国后，这些华丽的宝石在田纳西州橡树岭等地进行提炼，然后运往新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯的奥本海默公司。  

It took nearly three years for Oppenheimer and his team to develop the bombs.  

奥本海默和他的团队花了近三年的时间才研制出炸弹。  

Even though the Germans surrendered in May 1945 (and it became clear they were not close to completing a nuclear bomb), the war in the Pacific still raged.  

尽管德国人于 1945 年 5 月投降（而且很明显他们并没有接近完成核弹），但太平洋战争仍在激烈进行。  

Ultimately, in August 1945, the US dropped two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first of which was filled with—like Papà said—Congolese uranium.  

最终，1945 年 8 月，美国在广岛和长崎投下了两枚原子弹，其中第一枚就像帕帕说的那样，装满了刚果铀。  

The second bomb was powered by plutonium, an element that was made from the uranium mined in Congo.  

第二颗原子弹由钚提供动力，钚是一种从刚果开采的铀中提炼出来的元素。

Jean Bele, the Congolese nuclear physicist, tells me radioactive isotopes are still in the ground near Shinkolobwe today.  

刚果核物理学家让-贝勒（Jean Bele）告诉我，放射性同位素如今仍然存在于新科隆布韦附近的地下。  

“Radioactive solids enter the water, the crops, the trees, the soil, the animals, and they get to the humans,” he said. We don’t know the extent of the radiation.  

"他说："放射性固体进入水、庄稼、树木、土壤和动物体内，然后进入人类体内。我们不知道辐射的程度。  

We do know that in Oak Ridge there is increased [cancer mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566496/). And near St. Louis, Missouri, where remains of the Congolese ore were dumped, contamination poses risks to workers for the next 1,000 years.  

我们确实知道，在橡树岭，癌症死亡率有所上升。在密苏里州圣路易斯市附近，刚果矿石的残骸被倾倒在那里，污染给工人带来了未来 1000 年的风险。

After the screening of _Oppenheimer_, like a fanboy, I approached Nolan in the lobby. I was able to ask him about the marbles, about why he chose them and what creative issue they solved.  

奥本海默》放映结束后，我像个影迷一样在大厅里找到了诺兰。我向他询问了关于大理石的问题，问他为什么选择大理石，大理石解决了什么创意问题。  

He acquiesced with a courtly nod: “I needed a way to demonstrate how long it would have taken to refine all that ore.” Then he added, “The number of marbles was actually mathematically accurate to represent the amount that they needed.”  

他礼貌地点点头，表示同意："我需要一种方法来证明提炼这些矿石需要多长时间"然后他补充道："弹珠的数量实际上在数学上准确地代表了他们需要的数量"。

Of course, without Congo, obtaining all that ore would have been impossible. In a race to build the bomb, both sides wanted the Congolese ore.  

当然，如果没有刚果，就不可能获得这些矿石。在制造原子弹的竞赛中，双方都想得到刚果的矿石。  

The Shinkolobwe mine was “a freak occurrence in nature,” according to [Colonel Nichols](https://archive.org/details/roadtotrinity0000nich/page/46/mode/2up?q=freak).  

尼科尔斯上校说，Shinkolobwe 矿是 "大自然中的一个怪胎"。  

“Nothing like it has ever again been found.” And that, of course, means that without Congo’s Black workers—terrorized and chicote-d into submission, digging essential war minerals 24 hours a day—the outcome of arguably the most consequential project in human history would have been very different.  

"再也找不到类似的东西"当然，这也意味着，如果没有刚果的黑人工人--他们被恐怖和蟑螂折磨得屈服，每天 24 小时挖掘重要的战争矿物--这个堪称人类历史上最具影响力的项目的结果将大相径庭。

In 1946, Sengier became the first non-American to receive the president’s Medal for Merit—“for the performance of an exceptionally meritorious or courageous act” that sealed the Allies’ victory.  

1946 年，森吉耶成为第一位获得总统功勋奖章的非美国人--"因为他做出了特别有功或勇敢的行为"，为盟军的胜利立下了汗马功劳。  

In a photo from the ceremony, you might see something else: a man with something to hide.  

在典礼上的一张照片中，你可能会看到一些别的东西：一个人有什么东西要隐藏。  

Intelligence during the war revealed that Sengier’s company also sold about 1.5 million pounds of Congolese uranium to the Nazis.  

战争期间的情报显示，森吉耶的公司还向纳粹出售了约 150 万磅刚果铀。  

In 1948, a radioactive mineral was named in Sengier’s honor: sengierite.  

1948 年，一种放射性矿物以森吉耶的名字命名：森吉耶石。

At the same time, the Congolese, the people I come from, set about tearing down the colonial systems meant to eclipse their power; they finally won their independence in 1960. Papà was 13 years old then, and though it would take years for him to learn about the uranium miners, he always knew that Congolese people matter to history.  

与此同时，刚果人，也就是我的祖先，开始摧毁旨在削弱他们力量的殖民制度；他们最终在 1960 年赢得了独立。那时帕帕 13 岁，虽然他花了很多年才了解到铀矿工人的情况，但他始终知道刚果人民对历史至关重要。

_Updated 8-29-23, 12:20 pm EST: This story was updated to clarify that the plutonium used in the bomb dropped over Nagasaki derived from uranium mined in Congo.  

美国东部时间 8-29-23 下午 12:20 更新：本新闻已更新，以澄清长崎原子弹中使用的钚来自刚果开采的铀。_

To tell the story of the fall of a realm, it’s best to start with its rise.  

要讲述一个王国衰落的故事，最好从它的崛起说起。

More than three thousand years ago, the Shang dynasty ruled the Chinese heartland.  

三千多年前，商朝统治着中国的中心地带。  

They raised a sprawling capital out of the yellow plains, and cast magnificent ritual vessels from bronze.  

他们在黄土高原上建起了庞大的都城，并用青铜铸造了宏伟的祭祀器皿。  

One of the criteria of civilization is writing, and they had the first Chinese writing, incising questions on turtle shells and ox scapulae, applying a heated rod, and reading the response of the spirits in the pattern of cracks.  

文明的标准之一是书写，他们有了中国最早的文字，在龟甲和牛肩胛骨上刻下问题，涂上加热棒，从裂纹中读出神灵的回应。  

“This year will Shang receive good harvest?” “Is the sick stomach due to ancestral harm?” “Offer three hundred Qiang prisoners to \[the deceased\] Father Ding?” The kings of Shang maintained a hegemony over their neighbors through military prowess, and sacrificed war captives from their campaigns totaling in the tens of thousands for the favor of their ancestors.   

"今年商国会有好收成吗？""胃病是祖先害的吗？""把三百名羌人俘虏献给已故的丁父？"商王靠军事力量维持对邻国的霸权，为了祖先的宠爱，他们牺牲了数以万计的战争俘虏。

But the Shang faced growing threat from the Zhou, a once-subordinate people from west beyond the mountains.  

但是，商朝面临着来自周的日益严重的威胁。  

Inspired by a rare conjunction of the planets in 1059 BC, the Zhou declared that there was such a thing as the Mandate of Heaven, a divine right to rule—and while the Shang had once held it, their misrule and immorality had forced the Mandate to pass to the Zhou.  

公元前 1059 年，在一次罕见的行星会合的启发下，周人宣布了天命的存在，这是一种神圣的统治权--虽然商朝曾经拥有天命，但由于他们的错误统治和不道德，天命被迫传给了周人。  

Thirteen years later, the Zhou and their allies defeated the Shang in battle, seized their capital, drove their king to suicide, and supplanted them as overlords of the Central Plains.  

13 年后，周人和他们的盟友在战争中打败了商朝，夺取了商朝的首都，迫使商王自杀，并取代商朝成为中原地区的霸主。

If the Shang were goth jocks, the Zhou were prep nerds. In grave goods, food-serving vessels replaced wine vessels. Mass human sacrifice disappeared, while bureaucracy expanded.  

如果说商朝人是哥特式的运动员，那么周朝人就是预科生中的书呆子。在墓葬物品中，食器取代了酒器。大规模的人祭消失了，而官僚机构却在扩张。  

The Shang lacked the state power to _administer_ their surrounding subject peoples so much as intimidate them into line; the Zhou, galvanized by a rebellion not long after the conquest, put serious thought into consolidating their control.  

While the king remained in the west to rule over the original Zhou lands, he sent relatives and allies east into the conquered territories to establish colonies at strategically important locations, anchoring Zhou rule in a sprawling network of hereditary regional lords bound together by blood, marriage, custom, and ancestor worship of the Heaven-blessed founding Zhou kings.  

周王留在西部统治原有的周地，同时向东派遣亲戚和盟友进入被征服的领土，在战略要地建立殖民地，使周朝的统治根植于一个庞大的世袭地区诸侯网络，这个网络因血缘、婚姻、习俗和对受上天庇佑的周朝开国君王的祖先崇拜而联系在一起。  

商朝缺乏管理周边臣民的国家力量，只能恐吓他们服从命令；而周朝在被征服后不久就因叛乱而振作起来，并认真考虑巩固自己的控制权。

For generations, the system worked, ensuring military successes at the borders and stability in the interior.  

几代人以来，这一制度发挥了作用，确保了边境的军事胜利和内地的稳定。  

The first reigns of the dynasty became a golden age in the cultural imagination for thousands of years.  

王朝的最初几个朝代成为数千年来文化想象中的黄金时代。  

But by the dynasty’s second century, barbarian incursions were putting the state on the defensive, and surviving records hint at waning control over the regional lords and power struggles at court.  

但到了王朝的第二个世纪，野蛮人的入侵使国家处于守势，现存的记录也暗示了对地区领主控制的减弱和宫廷中的权力斗争。  

771 BC marked a breaking point, when barbarians allied with disgruntled nobles to overrun the royal domain and kill King You of Zhou.  

公元前 771 年，蛮族与心怀不满的贵族联合攻占王室领地，杀死了周幽王，这标志着一个突破点。

Legend has it that the king was bewitched by his new consort, a melancholy beauty born from a virgin impregnated by the touch of a black salamander.  

传说国王被他的新妃子迷住了，她是一个忧郁的美人，是被黑蝾螈触碰而受孕的处女所生。  

Desperate to make her laugh, the king pranked his lords by lighting the beacon fires intended to summon them in case of invasion.  

为了逗她开心，国王恶作剧地点燃了烽火，以备入侵时召唤诸侯。  

When she delighted at the sight, he kept playing the same trick until the lords got sick of him and stopped coming, which doomed him when the barbarians _actually_ invaded.   

她一高兴，他就继续玩同样的把戏，直到领主们厌烦了他，不再来找他。

But the historical reality seems to be the usual sordid political struggle around a new consort—and heir—threatening the power of the old one.  

但历史的真实情况似乎是，围绕着新财团和继承人威胁旧财团权力的肮脏政治斗争司空见惯。  

The original queen’s powerful father allied with barbarians to root out the upstart, only to get maybe more than he bargained for.  

原女王强大的父亲与野蛮人结盟，要铲除这个后起之秀，但得到的也许比他想要的更多。  

Sure, he put his grandkid on the throne in the end, but the royal house had been devastated.  

当然，他最终还是把孙子送上了王位，但王室却遭到了毁灭性的打击。  

It would never regain the ancestral lands it had lost to the barbarians, the direct holdings that filled its treasury and provided for its armies.  

它再也无法夺回被野蛮人夺走的祖先的土地，这些土地直接充实了它的国库，为它提供了军队。  

The king retreated east into the Central Plains, playing ground of lords that were now more powerful than him.  

国王向东撤退到了中原，这里是现在比他更强大的诸侯们的游戏场。  

While the royal line remained symbolically important, as holder of the Mandate of Heaven from which all the states derived their legitimacy, the loss of central authority in every other sense would unleash centuries of intensifying interstate warfare and upheaval.  

虽然王室仍然具有重要的象征意义，因为它是天命的持有者，而所有国家的合法性都来自于天命，但从其他任何意义上讲，中央权威的丧失都将引发数百年来愈演愈烈的国家间战争和动乱。

This is the world of the _Spring and Autumn Annals_, and the _Zuozhuan_.  

这就是《春秋》和《左传》的世界。

“Spring and Autumn Annals” is a bit of a redundant translation, since ”spring and autumn” was just an old way of saying “year,” and thus, “annals.” And technically, there were _multiple_ Spring and Autumn Annals—every state kept, in addition to court and administrative documents, its own laconic record of each year’s wars, diplomacy, natural phenomena, major rites, and notable deaths.  

But the state of Lu’s is special, because Confucius was from Lu.  

但鲁国比较特殊，因为孔子是鲁国人。  

He’s said to have personally edited and compiled the extant version of its 242-year-long Spring and Autumn, loading each character with weighty yet subtle moral deliberation.  

据说他亲自编辑和编纂了长达 242 年的《春秋》现存版本，为每个人物都赋予了沉重而微妙的道德思考。  

This ensured it a place in the Confucian canon, and its survival where every other state’s annals have been lost to time.  

这确保了它在儒家典籍中的一席之地，也确保了它在其他所有国家的史册都被时间湮没的情况下依然存在。  

The era that it covers is named the Spring and Autumn period after the text, not the other way around.  

它所涵盖的时代以文字命名为春秋，而不是相反。  

"春秋 "的翻译有点多余，因为 "春秋 "只是 "年 "的一种古老说法，因此也是 "年 "的一种说法。严格说来，《春秋》有好几种--除了宫廷和行政文件外，每个国家都有自己的简短记录，记载每年的战争、外交、自然现象、重大仪式和著名的死亡事件。

Taken on its own, though, the _Annals_ is little more than a list of dry facts. For example, the first year reads:  

不过，单看《年鉴》，它不过是一份枯燥的事实清单。例如，第一年的内容如下

> The first year, spring, the royal first month.  
> 
> 元年，春，皇家正月。
> 
> In the third month, our lord and Zhu Yifu swore a covenant at Mie.  
> 
> 三月，主公与朱义府在三重立下盟约。
> 
> In summer, in the fifth month, the Liege of Zheng overcame Duan at Yan.  
> 
> 夏，五月，郑列国克段于燕。
> 
> In autumn, in the seventh month, the Heaven-appointed king sent his steward Xuan to us to present the funeral equipment for Lord Hui and Zhong Zi.  
> 
> 秋天，七月，天命王派他的管家宣来我们这里，为惠公和钟子期送上丧葬用具。
> 
> In the ninth month, we swore a covenant with a Song leader at Su.  
> 
> 九月，我们在苏国与宋国首领盟誓。
> 
> In winter, in the twelfth month, the Zhai Liege came.  
> 
> 冬十二月，翟列来。
> 
> Gongzi Yishi died. 公子仪士卒。

Who is Zhu Yifu? Who’s Duan? What’s all this about “overcoming”? Where does the moral deliberation come in?  

朱毅夫是谁？小段是谁？什么叫 "战胜"？道德评议从何而来？  

This canon badly needs meta, and the most notable of the ancient commentaries written for the _Spring and Autumn Annals_ is the _Zuozhuan._ Ten times as long as the text it’s for, the _Zuozhuan_ is the flesh on the _Annals’_ bare bones, one of the foundational works of ancient Chinese literature and history-writing in its own right.  

这部典籍亟需元典，而在为《春秋》撰写的古代注释中，最著名的当属《左传》。左传》的篇幅是《春秋》的十倍，是《春秋》的血肉，是中国古代文学和历史著作的奠基之作之一。

While tradition attributes the text’s authorship to Zuo Qiuming, a contemporary of Confucius, most modern historians date its compilation to the century after.  

虽然传统上认为《左传》的作者是与孔子同时代的左丘明，但大多数现代历史学家认为《左传》的编纂时间是在孔子之后的一个世纪。  

In its extant form, it’s presented interleaved with the _Annals_, so that after the _Annals’_ account of each year, with entries such as…  

在现存形式中，它与《年鉴》交错呈现，因此，在《年鉴》记述每年的条目之后，如...

> In summer, in the sixth month, on the _yiyou_ day (26), Gongzi Guisheng of Zheng assassinated his ruler, Yi.  
> 
> 夏，六月乙酉日（26 日），郑国公子贵生刺杀国君夷。

…you have the _Zuozhuan’s_ account of the year, mostly composed of elaborations upon the above entries, such as:  

......《左传》对这一年的记载，主要是对上述条目的阐述，如

> The leaders of Chu presented a large turtle to Lord Ling of Zheng. Gongzi Song and Gongzi Guisheng were about to have an audience with the lord.  
> 
> 楚国的领导人向郑灵公献上了一只大龟。公子宋和公子归生正要觐见郑灵公。  
> 
> Gongzi Song’s index finger moved involuntarily.  
> 
> 公子宋的食指不由自主地动了一下。  
> 
> He showed it to Gongzi Guisheng and said, “On other days when my finger did this, I always without fail got to taste something extraordinary.” As they entered, the cook was about to take the turtle apart.  
> 
> 他拿给公子归生看，说："往日我的手指这样做，总能品尝到不同凡响的美味。"他们进门时，厨师正准备把甲鱼拆开。  
> 
> They looked at each other and smiled. The lord asked why, and Gongzi Guisheng told him.  
> 
> 两人相视而笑。主公问为什么，公子归生告诉了他。  
> 
> When the lord had the high officers partake of the turtle, he called Gongzi Song forward but did not give him any.  
> 
> 当主公让高级官员们分食甲鱼时，他把公子宋叫到跟前，但没有分给他。  
> 
> Furious, Gongzi Song dipped his finger into the cauldron, tasted the turtle, and left. The lord was so enraged that he wanted to kill Gongzi Song.  
> 
> 公子宋大怒，用手指蘸了鳖，尝了一口就走了。主公气得要杀公子宋。  
> 
> Gongzi Song plotted with Gongzi Guisheng to act first.  
> 
> 公子宋与公子贵生密谋，先行行动。  
> 
> Gongzi Guisheng said, “Even with an aging domestic animal, one is reluctant to kill it.  
> 
> 公子归生说："即使是年老的家畜，也舍不得杀。  
> 
> How much more so then with the ruler?” Gongzi Song turned things around and slandered Gongzi Guisheng.  
> 
> 何况于君乎？"公子宋话锋一转，诋毁公子归生。  
> 
> Gongzi Guisheng became fearful and complied with him. In the summer, they assassinated Lord Ling.  
> 
> 公子归生害怕了，就顺从了他。夏天，他们刺杀了凌公。
> 
> The text says, “Gongzi Guisheng of Zheng assassinated his ruler, Yi”: this is because he fell short in weighing the odds.  
> 
> 文中说 "郑公子贵生刺其君夷"：这是因为他没有权衡好胜负。  
> 
> The noble man said, “To be benevolent without martial valor is to achieve nothing.” In all cases when a ruler is assassinated, naming the ruler \[with his personal name rather than his title\] means that he violated the way of rulership; naming the subject means that the blame lies with him.  
> 
> 君子曰："仁而不武，无功也"。凡国君遇刺，\[用国君的名字而不是爵位\]点国君的名，表示国君违背了为君之道；点臣子的名，表示臣子咎由自取。

There’s a few too many mythological creatures and just-so stories for the _Zuozhuan_ to be taken entirely at face value, but it’s clear that its creator(s) had access to diverse now-lost records for the era portrayed.  

For example, some of the events show a two-month dating discrepancy—one of the states used a different calendar, and most likely the creator(s) overlooked the difference when borrowing from sources from that state.  

例如，有些事件的日期有两个月的差异--其中一个州使用不同的日历，很可能是创作者在借用该州的资料时忽略了这一差异。  

While the overall level of historical rigor versus 4th century BC authorial invention remains under heated debate, the虽然《左传》中有太多的神话传说和故事，不能完全信以为真，但可以肯定的是，它的创作者能够接触到所描绘时代的各种现已失传的记录。 _Zuozhuan_ is undeniably the most comprehensive written source on its era that we have.   

虽然《左传》的历史严谨性与公元前 4 世纪作者的杜撰之间的总体水平仍存在激烈的争论，但不可否认的是，《左传》是我们所掌握的关于那个时代最全面的书面资料。

And importantly, it’s _enjoyable_.   

更重要的是，它令人愉悦。

You can think of the _Zuozhuan_ as the Gene Wolfe of ancient historical works. It’s not an easy read, especially in translation, where names that are visibly distinct in the original (e.g.  

季, 急, 姬, etc.) all get unhelpfully collapsed into one transliteration (Ji).  

季、急、姬等）都被无益地合并成一个音译词（姬）。  

The work drops you into a whirl of nouns and events, some of them one-off asides, others part of long-running narrative threads that might only surface again decades of entries later.  

作品将你带入一个名词和事件的漩涡中，其中一些是一次性的旁白，另一些则是长期叙事线索的一部分，可能几十年后才会再次出现。  

While a casual readthrough still offers plenty of rewards, putting together all the subtext, references, and connections between entries is an endeavor that’s occupied readers for millennia.  

虽然随意通读仍有很多收获，但将所有的潜台词、参考文献和条目之间的联系归纳起来，却是千百年来读者一直在做的事情。  

Your unreliable narrator remains enigmatic on most of the events he presents, leaving interpretation as an exercise for the reader; when he does speak, either directly or in the voice of the “noble man”你可以把《左传》看作是古代历史著作中的吉恩-沃尔夫（Gene Wolfe）。这本书读起来并不轻松，尤其是在翻译过程中，原文中明显不同的人名（如 _,_ he can raise more questions than he answers. For one, the rule about the naming of an assassinated ruler largely holds in the _Annals_, but seems to have some notable exceptions.  

你这位不可靠的叙述者对他所描述的大部分事件都保持着神秘的态度，让读者自己去解读；当他直接或以 "贵族 "的口吻说话时，他所提出的问题要比他所回答的问题多得多。首先，在《年鉴》中，为被暗杀的统治者命名的规则基本成立，但似乎也有一些明显的例外。

But if you’re willing to plunge in, the work offers an experience unlike anything else. To read the _Zuozhuan_ is to gaze through a dark kaleidoscope at an alien, fascinating world in turmoil, to freewheel through wars,  

但如果你愿意投入其中，这部作品会给你带来与众不同的体验。阅读《左传》就像透过黑暗的万花筒，凝视着一个动荡不安、令人神往的异域世界，在战争中自由驰骋、

> As they were about to do battle, Gongsun Xia ordered his troops to sing “The Funeral of Yu.” Chen Ni ordered all his troops to hold jade in their mouths.  
> 
> 双方即将交战，公孙夏令军唱《虞美人》。陈尼令全军含玉。  
> 
> Giving orders to his troops, Gongsun Hui said, “A length of rope for each man: in Wu they cut their hair short.” Dongguo Shu said, “If I go to war three times, I am certain to die.  
>

> 
> With this it comes to three.” He sent someone to pay his respects to Xian Shi with a zither, saying, “I will not see you again.” Chen Shu said, “In this march, I will hear the drums alone.

Ministers with various viewpoints discourse at length upon history, governance, politics, custom, morality, and the nature of ghosts and spirits.  

持有不同观点的部长们就历史、治理、政治、习俗、道德以及鬼神的本质进行了长篇大论。  

Diplomatic envoys exchange veiled remarks with their hosts by singing odes from their shared cultural canon (many of which survive to this day, through another compilation associated with Confucius.)   

外交使节通过吟唱共同文化典籍中的颂歌（其中许多颂歌通过与孔子有关的另一种汇编流传至今），与他们的主人交换含蓄的话语。

Scatters of vivid anecdotes sketch out conflicted, impressionistic portraits of the recurring historical figures.  

散落的生动轶事为反复出现的历史人物勾勒出矛盾的、印象派的肖像。  

While the narrative certainly likes some people better than others, there’s always enough messiness in the events presented, and enough fondness for oblique judgment in the ancient Chinese historical tradition, to leave room for the reader to form their own opinion—even for Confucius himself.  

虽然叙事肯定喜欢某些人胜过其他人，但所呈现的事件总有足够的混乱，而且中国古代历史传统中也有足够多的喜好，为读者留下了形成自己观点的空间，甚至孔子本人也是如此。  

His purported judgments are scattered throughout the text of the _Zuozhuan_, but he also appears as an actual historical figure toward the end, a minister of the state of Lu, navigating between ideals and circumstances just like everyone else.  

In both cases, he proves more interesting and complex than the common perception of him—to the point of unsettling some commentators from later eras where Confucius had become a nigh-divine figure.  

在这两种情况下，孔子都比人们对他的普遍看法更有趣、更复杂，甚至让一些后世的评论家感到不安，因为在后世，孔子已成为近乎神化的人物。  

他所谓的判断散见于《左传》全文，但在结尾处，他也作为一个真实的历史人物出现了，他是鲁国的大臣，和其他人一样，在理想和环境之间游走。

There’s a lot of things you can say about the _Zuozhuan_, and most of them have probably been said already, with the two thousand years of further commentary it’s spawned.  

But I can offer this: it made me think about what it means to live in a world that’s falling apart.  

但我可以这样说：它让我思考生活在一个分崩离析的世界中意味着什么。  

关于《左传》，可以说的有很多，其中大部分可能都已经说过了，两千年来，人们对它的评论也越来越多。

Western Zhou, from the initial conquest to the fall of the capital, stood for 275 years—longer than the United States has existed.  

西周从最初被征服到都城陷落，历时 275 年，比美国存在的时间还要长。  

The decay of the system it created would take about as long.  

它所创建的系统的衰变也需要同样长的时间。  

Decades went by before the weakness of the king fully sank in, and decades more before one powerful lord, seeing intensifying interstate warfare and barbarian threats, hit upon the idea of the position of hegemon: commanding the various states on _behalf_ of the king, at least in name. But any interstate order he created died with him, and the scramble of the other lords to claim hegemon status for themselves ended with _two_ major rival powers whose back-and-forth wars and demands for homage ravaged the smaller states trapped between them.  

One of those powers weakened due to internal turmoil (more below); the other was nearly destroyed by a new contender, a peripheral non-Sinitic kingdom—whose overextension led to its own destruction soon after by a different kingdom.  

其中一个强国因内部动荡而衰弱（详见下文）；另一个强国则差点被一个新的竞争者--一个外围的非西尼特王国--所摧毁。  

An early lord of the Spring and Autumn period, upon overrunning a neighbor, merely installed a few loyal nobles before going home; by the end of the era, outright conquest of other Zhou states had become routine.  

春秋早期的诸侯国在征服一个邻国后，只是安插了几个忠诚的贵族就打道回府了；到了春秋末期，彻底征服其他周国已成为家常便饭。  

几十年过去了，国王的软弱性才完全显现出来，又过了几十年，一位强大的领主看到国家间的战争和野蛮人的威胁日益加剧，萌生了称霸的想法：至少在名义上代表国王指挥各邦。但他所建立的国家间秩序也随之消亡，其他诸侯争先恐后地为自己争取霸主地位，最终形成了两个主要的敌对势力，他们来回征战，要求臣服，蹂躏着夹在他们中间的小国。

The breakdown of the old order between states was mirrored by the breakdown within. Of the first four rulers of Lu in the _Zuozhuan_, three were murdered.  

Just as the Zhou royal house lost control of its lords, its lords would lose control of their relatives and ministerial families; in many states, the lords devolved to helpless figureheads, while hereditary ministers competed with each other at the expense of the state.  

就像周王室失去了对其诸侯的控制一样，诸侯也会失去对其亲属和大臣家族的控制；在许多国家，诸侯沦为无助的人物，而世袭的大臣则相互竞争，牺牲国家利益。  

The most dramatic case was the state of Jin, which inaugurated the start of the Spring and Autumn period with a brutal multi-generational succession struggle; at that point, the king was still strong enough to intervene, but not strong enough to actually fix things.  

最戏剧性的案例是晋国，它以一场残酷的多代继承人之争揭开了春秋时代的序幕；在那个时候，国君的力量还足以干预，但还不足以真正解决问题。  

The eventually victorious usurping branch decided to prevent future succession struggles by slaughtering all the other branches and exiling any extraneous potential heirs…which, ironically, cleared the way for ministerial lineages to usurp power from a diminished ruling house.  

最终取得胜利的篡位分支决定屠杀所有其他分支，并放逐任何无关的潜在继承人，以防止未来的继承斗争......具有讽刺意味的是，这为大臣世系从衰落的统治家族中篡夺权力扫清了道路。  

After lengthy infighting and multiple rounds of familial exterminations, the remaining three ministerial lineages would ultimately divide the state of Jin among themselves.  

经过漫长的内讧和多轮灭族之后，剩下的三个大臣世系最终瓜分了晋国。  

国与国之间旧秩序的瓦解与国内秩序的瓦解如出一辙。左传》中鲁国的前四位君主中，有三位被杀。

The Partition of Jin is often considered the end date of the Spring and Autumn period. States could and did destroy states before then, but the _creation_ of new independent ruling lines was different.  

Granting rulership had been the prerogative of the king, through which the Mandate of Heaven flowed, some echo of the divine command to overthrow tyranny and build a virtuous order; now, there was increasingly little justification for rulership beyond the power required to seize it.  

授予统治权曾是国王的特权，天命通过它流淌，是推翻暴政、建立良性秩序的神圣命令的某种回响；现在，除了夺取统治权所需的权力之外，统治权的理由越来越少。  

晋国的分封通常被认为是春秋时期的终结日。在此之前，国家可以也确实消灭了国家，但建立新的独立统治线则有所不同。

That set the tone for the Warring States period that followed. The interstate arena became a no-holds-barred all-against-all.  

这为后来的战国时代定下了基调。国与国之间的竞技场变成了毫无悬念的你死我活。  

States reformed into war machines that lived and died based on how many hundreds of thousands of conscript infantry they could push out onto a battlefield.  

国家被改造成战争机器，其生死存亡取决于他们能把几十万应征入伍的步兵推上战场。  

New philosophies sought to make sense of a world that had burst through the bounds of existing ideas—the Warring States, for all its brutality, was an era of intellectual flourishing.  

战国虽然残酷，但却是一个思想繁荣的时代。

The Spring and Autumn period can appear the provincial, less glamorous era, next to the Warring States period with all its ambition, dynamism, and wandering men of talent full of new ideas to change the world.  

与战国时期的雄心勃勃、朝气蓬勃，以及充满改变世界的新思想的流浪才俊相比，春秋时期可能显得是一个外省的、不那么光彩夺目的时代。  

But that’s what makes the world of the _Zuozhuan_ so oddly _relatable_.  

但这正是《左传》世界的奇特可亲之处。

For all that the _Zuozhuan_ is accused of didacticism, I’d assert that the stories we have of the figures of the Warring States are even more so. In an era where [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) reigns, there’s little room for fluff; stories have to be edited down, sleek and streamlined in the service of an agenda. Whereas the _Zuozhuan_, despite covering over two hundred years and thousands of figures with a word count lower than many fantasy trilogies’, is full of that human richness and messiness.  

People get squeamish and hangry and do dumb frivolous things (that they then implore the court scribe not to write down.) They make witty poetic references, and complain when the other person doesn’t get them.  

人们会变得胆怯、饥渴，做一些无聊的蠢事（然后恳求法庭抄写员不要记下来），他们会诙谐地引用诗句，当对方不明白时又会抱怨。  

They politely decline when their grandmother wants to have sex with them (or, alternatively, get depressed when they find out their grandmother wants to murder them in favor of the hot grandson anyway.)  

当祖母想和他们发生性关系时，他们会礼貌地拒绝（或者，当他们发现祖母想谋杀他们，而让他们去找性感的孙子时，他们会感到沮丧）。  

虽然《左传》被指责为说教，但我敢断言，我们所知道的战国人物故事更是如此。在一个魔罗统治的时代，容不得半点花哨；为了达到目的，必须对故事进行删减、精简。而《左传》尽管涵盖了两百多年的历史和成千上万的人物，字数比许多幻想三部曲还少，却充满了人性的丰富和混乱。

The collapse of the Zhou sociopolitical order wasn’t an abstract phenomenon. It permeated the lives of thinking, feeling human beings, who reacted as human beings were wont to do.  

周朝社会政治秩序的崩溃并不是一个抽象的现象。它渗透到有思想、有感情的人的生活中，而这些人的反应也是人类惯常的。  

Many of them understood themselves to live in a fallen age full of evils, and pondered at length what had gone wrong and how to fix things.  

他们中的许多人认为自己生活在一个充满罪恶的堕落时代，并长时间地思考到底哪里出了问题以及如何解决问题。  

It’s just that, as we can see from the lengthy speeches where they laid out their reasoning, the ideas that they knew were about as up to the task as chariots against artillery.  

只是，我们可以从他们阐述自己的理由的长篇演说中看到，他们所知道的思想就像战车对抗大炮一样，根本无法胜任这项任务。  

Their conceptual maps could not grasp the territory.  

他们的概念地图无法把握全局。

I’ve seen one reader exclaim that the people of the Spring and Autumn era read like demonic spirits.  

我看到一位读者感叹说，春秋时代的人读起来就像恶魔的灵魂。  

Figures from even a century or two later argue from nice rational self-interest in ways that are comprehensible to us today, but for the people in the _Zuozhuan_, especially the early figures, the world spun on different axes.  

That’s not to say they didn’t understand self-interest, or that their high-flown speeches couldn’t disguise ruthless calculation, but they interfaced with the world through concepts like Heaven’s Mandate and ritual propriety, truly believed in them the way medieval Europe believed in Hell and heresy.  

这并不是说他们不懂得利己主义，也不是说他们的高谈阔论掩盖不了无情的算计，而是说他们通过天命和礼仪等概念与世界沟通，真正相信这些概念，就像中世纪的欧洲相信地狱和异端邪说一样。

Only, while medieval thinkers at least had ideas from the Classical world to draw on, the thinkers of the Spring and Autumn had no predecessors from more advanced societies than theirs.

  

只是，中世纪的思想家至少还有古典世界的思想可以借鉴，而春秋时期的思想家却没有比他们更先进的社会的前辈。  

They were from a Bronze Age kin-based society forced to rapidly scale up by its own success, far beyond what their existing customs and worldview had evolved for.  

他们来自青铜时代以亲属为基础的社会，由于自身的成功而被迫迅速扩大规模，远远超出了他们现有的习俗和世界观所能适应的范围。  

Later peripheral conquerors of China could at least copy the homework of the existing empire, but the Zhou conquered the Shang, whose rudimentary state had never managed more than loose hegemony beyond their core lands, a parochial project next to what the Zhou had committed to.  

后来的中国外围征服者至少可以复制现有帝国的功课，但周朝征服了商朝，而商朝的简陋国家从未在其核心土地之外实现过松散的霸权，这与周朝致力于实现的目标相比是一个狭隘的计划。  

In that light, it’s truly impressive that the Zhou were as successful as they were.   

由此看来，周人的成功确实令人印象深刻。  

即使是一两百年后的人物，也会以我们今天可以理解的方式，从美好的理性自利出发进行论证，但对于《左传》中的人物，尤其是早期人物来说，世界是在不同的轴线上旋转的。

And maybe it’s understandable that figures like Confucius are so preoccupied with quoting the classics and observing ritual propriety without “deviation”.  

而像孔子这样的人物如此专注于引经据典、遵守礼仪礼节而不 "出格"，或许也是可以理解的。  

Clearly their ancestors had done things right, because they’d built something unprecedented in China.  

显然，他们的祖先做了正确的事情，因为他们建造了中国前所未有的东西。  

There had been a time without endemic fratricidal violence, when the Zhou were a united people from the mountains to the sea.  

曾几何时，周人从高山到海洋都是团结的，没有地方性的自相残杀。  

By inserting intercalary months according to ritual propriety, they could maintain the order of the calendar year, the plantings and harvests that sustained all of society.  

通过按照礼仪适当插入闰月，他们可以维持历年的秩序，维持整个社会的种植和收获。  

Surely, by arranging ancestral tablets and interpersonal relations according to ritual propriety, they could maintain the order of society.  

当然，通过按照礼仪安排祖先的牌位和人际关系，他们可以维护社会秩序。

Chinese philosophers from just a century or two later would think this was ludicrous.  

一两百年后的中国哲学家会认为这太可笑了。  

Zhuangzi would snark about dressing a monkey up in the robes of the first regent Duke of Zhou—it would only bite and tear the robes off.  

庄子曾讽刺说，把猴子穿上周公的袍子，它只会咬人，把袍子扯下来。  

The world had changed; the golden age was forever gone, even if you aped its trappings.  

世界已经变了；黄金时代一去不复返了，即使你模仿它的外衣。  

Lord Shang, the Legalist reformer, might’ve been the first to go deeper, theorizing that the pressures of growing population create new problems and require the development of new forms of governance.  

法家改革家商君可能是第一个深入研究的人，他认为人口增长的压力带来了新的问题，需要发展新的治理形式。  

Certainly, with the ideas we have today, it’s clear that the golden age was completely unsustainable to begin with.   

当然，以我们今天的观念来看，黄金时代显然一开始就完全不可持续。

The combination of elite polygyny and hereditary positions is a recipe for runaway elite overproduction.  

精英一夫多妻制和职位世袭制的结合是精英过度生产失控的秘诀。  

The golden age existed because, for the first generations after the conquest, the king could simply jettison all his younger sons and brothers with their entourages east to found new colonies.  

黄金时代之所以存在，是因为在征服后的头几代人中，国王可以简单地把所有的儿子和兄弟连同他们的随从一起扔到东部去建立新的殖民地。  

The Zhou could work with societal rules evolved for smaller groups, as long as there was opportunity to split off those smaller groups and send them elsewhere.   

只要有机会将这些小团体分裂出去并送往其他地方，周人就可以使用为小团体制定的社会规则。

But inevitably, the opportunity ended.  

但机会不可避免地结束了。  

The golden age would be romanticized as a time where no penal punishments had to be exacted on the populace for forty years, which likely means it was a time when everyone understood it was easier to take resources from non-Zhou populations than from one’s own people—one doubts Zhou’s neighbors would consider those years a golden age.  

黄金时代将被浪漫化为一个四十年来无需对民众施以刑罚的时代，这很可能意味着那是一个人人都明白从非周人那里夺取资源比从自己人那里夺取资源更容易的时代--我怀疑周的邻国会把那段岁月视为黄金时代。  

But at some point the king necessarily started running out of territory to hand out to his supporters that didn’t already belong to other supporters, and the law of diminishing returns put an end to conquering more land.  

但是，到了一定时候，国王必然会开始耗尽领地，而这些领地又不属于他的支持者，收益递减法则使得征服更多土地的行为终止。  

Simultaneously, the personal bond between the king and the established regional lords, at first the relationship between brothers, sons, and comrades-in-arms, would dilute over the generations to the relationship between distant cousins who paid occasional visits.  

与此同时，国王与地区领主之间的个人联系，最初是兄弟、儿子和战友之间的关系，经过几代人的努力，逐渐淡化为偶尔拜访的远房表亲之间的关系。  

Kinship ties and camaraderie had to be increasingly substituted with bureaucracy and coercion.  

亲情和友情不得不越来越多地被官僚主义和强制手段所取代。  

It took nine generations before the king publicly boiled one of his lords alive to send a message.  

九代之后，国王才公开将他的一位领主活活煮死以示警告。

And none of the thinking beings in the _Zuozhuan_, for all their debates and worrying about the world, could’ve understood the additional forces of change beginning to awaken in their own era.  

This period is also the beginning of China’s Iron Age, a prerequisite for the tools for increased agricultural production and the weapons for mass infantry that would enable the dynamics of the Warring States.  

这一时期也是中国铁器时代的开端，它是农业生产工具和大规模步兵武器的先决条件，而这些工具和武器将为战国的发展提供动力。  

And despite Confucius having a reputation as a hardcore traditionalist, he was actually in many ways one of the future. He belonged to the rising而《左传》中那些有思想的人，尽管他们对世界进行了种种争论和担忧，却没有一个人能够理解在他们自己的时代开始觉醒的更多变革力量。 _shi_ class—fallen nobles or enterprising commoners whose ties to land and lineage had been broken in the tumult of the Spring and Autumn, who moved between states freely and made their living serving the powerful as warriors, officials, and retainers.  

The great powers of the Warring States era would depend on an alliance of the ruler and the尽管孔子有 "铁杆传统主义者 "的名声，但实际上他在很多方面都是未来派。他属于崛起的士族--没落的贵族或有进取心的平民，他们与土地和血统的联系在春秋的动荡中被打破，他们在诸侯国之间自由迁徙，以武士、官员和家臣的身份为权贵服务。 _shi_ against the landed nobility to create a highly bureaucratized state that could directly wield its masses in war and agriculture.  

Most of the famous philosophers and ministers of this era would come from the战国时期的大国将依靠君、士联盟来对抗地主贵族，从而建立一个高度官僚化的国家，在战争和农业中直接支配群众。 _shi_.  

这个时代的大多数著名哲学家和大臣都来自石室。

At the same time, even if the traditionalists in the _Zuozhuan_ put some ridiculous faith in ritual propriety, even if they couldn’t possibly have restored the old ways, were they wrong to fear what lay ahead? Most of them were from the landed warrior-noble lineages, who’d be made obsolete by the breakdown of the old world that they themselves had fueled.  

And the result of the Red Queen’s race between the states would be the destruction of与此同时，即使《左传》中的传统主义者对礼制抱有某种可笑的信仰，即使他们不可能恢复旧有的方式，但他们对未来的担忧有错吗？他们中的大多数人都来自有土地的武士贵族世家，旧世界的瓦解会让他们变得过时，而他们自己却推波助澜。 _every_ existing state—including Qin, the ostensible winner, which collapsed in two generations and saw its capital sacked, its ruling family exterminated, its archives torched.  

With it burnt almost all the remaining copies of the books and records from the states and the centuries before it.   

各州及之前几个世纪的书籍和记录几乎全部被烧毁。  

而红皇后在诸侯国之间竞赛的结果，将是每一个现存国家的毁灭，包括秦国，这个表面上的赢家，在两代人的时间里就崩溃了，它的首都被洗劫一空，它的统治家族被灭族，它的档案被付之一炬。

Later dynasties would turn to the Zhou classics as a source of legitimacy, but underneath the Confucian trappings, the empires would be built atop the Legalist structures forged in the fires of the Warring States.  

后来的王朝将周代经典作为合法性的来源，但在儒家的外衣之下，帝国将建立在战国之火中形成的法家结构之上。  

People tend to think of ancient cultures, and especially ancient Chinese culture, as a monolith—the eternal Middle Kingdom—but by then the ancients didn’t understand _their_ ancients.  

This had something to do with Qin repressions and the burning of the archives, where huge amounts of material were forever lost, and what survived was often of dubious provenance.  

这与秦国的镇压和焚毁档案有关，大量资料永远地消失了，而幸存下来的资料往往来源可疑。  

Scholars would accept later forgeries as genuine writings for millennia—I didn’t realize for the longest time that the人们往往认为古代文化，尤其是中国古代文化是一个整体--永恒的中原文化，但那时的古人并不了解他们的古人。 _Rites of Zhou_ was written during the Warring States and not Western Zhou.  

But that also goes to show the enormous gulf between the Zhou and their claimed inheritors, because no, it didn’t seem implausible that massive bureaucratic government departments named after seasons were more than wishful Confucianist utopian worldbuilding exercises.  

但这也说明了周人与他们声称的继承者之间的巨大鸿沟，因为不，以季节命名的庞大官僚政府部门不仅仅是一厢情愿的儒家乌托邦式的世界构建活动，这似乎并不难以置信。  

(And then later dynasties took the wishful Confucianist utopian worldbuilding exercises as actual governmental inspiration!) In effect, Chinese history can be divided into imperial and pre-imperial.  

(后来的朝代又把儒家乌托邦式的世界建设一厢情愿地当作实际的政府灵感！）。实际上，中国历史可以分为帝制和帝制以前的历史。  

千百年来，学者们都把后来的赝品当作真品来接受，我很长时间都没有意识到《周礼》成书于战国，而不是西周。

Good riddance, you might say. The Zhou were overhyped and their system ought to be put out of its misery.  

你可能会说，这下好了。周人被过分夸大了，他们的制度应该脱离苦海。  

Surely the Warring States, with its Hundred Schools of Thought and fresh outlook, has more to offer us.  

当然，百家争鸣、面貌一新的战国可以为我们提供更多。  

But the thing is, I don’t think the Warring States is the best analogue for our own time.  

但问题是，我不认为战国是我们这个时代的最佳类比。

The existing foundations of our world are damaged but not broken. For all the upheavals in recent years, I struggle to believe that the pace of change will _slow_, or that the ideas to truly make sense of these changes already exist. This is only the beginning, and the _Zuozhuan_ gives a visceral sense of what that really means. Our culture wars will seem like people getting mad over ancestral tablet placements.  

People in the future will look at us the way we look at Ai Jiang weeping for her murdered sons, “Oh, Heaven! Xiangzhong violated the proper way.  

将来人们看我们的眼神，就像我们看爱姜哭诉她被杀的儿子一样："哦，上天啊！湘中犯上。  

He killed the legitimate heir and established a secondary son.” There’s more than one layer of grief.  

他杀了合法继承人，立了次子"。悲伤不止一层。  

我们这个世界现有的基础虽然受到破坏，但并没有支离破碎。虽然近年来发生了很多动荡，但我很难相信变革的步伐会放缓，也很难相信真正能够理解这些变革的思想已经存在。这仅仅是个开始，《左传》让我们直观地感受到了这意味着什么。我们的文化战争就像人们为了祖先的牌位而发火。

The _Zuozhuan_ can’t provide satisfying answers. But it can provide a sense of perspective, and recognition. I can conclude with one further anecdote from the _Zuozhuan_, for the commentators to the commentary on the commentary to weigh as they see fit.  

In 536 BC, toward the end of the Spring and Autumn period, the state of Zheng cast a penal code in bronze.  

公元前 536 年，即春秋末期，郑国用青铜铸造了一部刑法。  

By the standards of the time, this was absolutely shocking, an upending of the existing order—to not only have a written law code, but to prepare it for public display so everyone could read it.  

按照当时的标准，这绝对是令人震惊的，是对现有秩序的颠覆--不仅要有成文的法典，还要将其公之于众，让每个人都能读到。  

A minister of a neighboring state wrote a lengthy protest to his friend Zichan (the dragon-ignorer), then the chief minister of Zheng:  

邻国的一位大臣给他的朋友、当时的郑国首相子产（龙颜大夫）写了一封长长的抗议信：  

左传》无法提供令人满意的答案。但它可以提供一种视角和认识。最后，我可以再讲《左传》中的一则轶事，供评论《左传》的评论者酌情权衡。

If you want to read the _Zuozhuan_ in its entirety in English, you have two options: a 19th century translation by James Legge [in the public domain](https://web.archive.org/web/20210629182253/http://www2.iath.virginia.edu:8080/exist/cocoon/xwomen/texts/chunqiu/tpage/tocc/bilingual), and the recent [Durrant, Li, and Schaberg translation](https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295999159/zuo-tradition-zuozhuan/), which I would _strongly_ recommend over the former.  

The new translation is much better organized, annotated, and explained—it trades elegance for accessibility in some ways, but I think most readers would find the latter a lot more important than the former when it comes to the如果您想阅读《左传》的英文全文，您有两个选择：一个是詹姆斯-莱格 19 世纪的公有译本，另一个是杜兰特、李和沙伯格最近的译本，相比前者，我强烈推荐后者。 _Zuozhuan_.   

新译本在条理、注释和解释方面都做得更好了--在某些方面，它用优雅换取了易读性，但我认为大多数读者在阅读《左传》时都会觉得后者比前者重要得多。

For example—the usage of names. The _Zuozhuan_ might refer to one figure by multiple different combinations of title, lineage name, given name, and courtesy name in different places.  

Naming gets especially bad with the later ministers, where, for example, Fan Hui is alternately referred to as Shi Hui, Shi Ji, Sui Wuzi, Sui Ji, Wu Ji, Wuzi, Jishi, Sui Hui, and Fan Wuzi.  

后期大臣的命名尤其糟糕，例如，樊会被交替称为士会、士季、遂武子、遂季、武季、武子、季氏、遂会和樊武子。  

The Legge translation adds some clarifications in brackets but isn’t comprehensive; the new translation standardizes names used wherever possible, so Fan Hui is always called Fan Hui, with a superscript index so you can look up what name was used in the original text in the back.  

莱格的译本在括号中添加了一些说明，但并不全面；新译本尽可能统一了使用的名称，因此樊会始终被称为樊会，并附有上标索引，以便您在后面查找原文中使用的名称。  

例如，姓名的用法。左传》可能在不同的地方用爵位、世系名称、姓氏和礼仪名称的多种不同组合来称呼一个人物。

If you’re just interested in the _Zuozhuan’s_ greatest hits, you also have two options. Durrant, Li, and Schaberg have come out with a shorter [reader](https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295747750/theizuo-tradition-zuozhuanireader/) of notable excerpts organized by topic. There’s also an older [partial translation](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Tso_Chuan/UcYRpKmh-W4C?hl=en&gbpv=0) by Burton Watson—I haven’t personally read it, but it seems regarded highly in terms of readability, both in terms of accessibility and artistry, though it takes some liberties with the text and organization.  

如果您只对《左传》中的名篇感兴趣，您还有两个选择。Durrant、Li 和 Schaberg 出版了一本较短的读物，按主题摘录了一些著名的片段。伯顿-沃森（Burton Watson）也有一本较早的部分译本，我本人没有读过，但它在可读性和艺术性方面似乎都得到了很高的评价，尽管它在文字和编排上有些随意。

For more information about this era, _Early China: A Social and Cultural History_ by Li Feng is a good overview, or the older _The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C_, edited by Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy_._ I also drew from Li Feng’s books on Western Zhou and Yuri Pines’s work on Spring and Autumn and Warring States philosophical development, and a little from the _Shiji_ by Sima Qian—which is another ancient Chinese historical work (generally considered _the_ ancient Chinese historical work, the one that established the model for the rest of imperial history) worth reading, for what it’s worth.  

While no complete English translation exists for the entire如需了解有关这一时代的更多信息，可参阅 Li Feng 所著的《中国早期社会文化史》（Early China：Li Feng 所著的《早期中国：社会与文化史》是一部很好的概述，或者是更早的《剑桥中国古代史》（The Cambridge History of Ancient China）：Michael Loewe 和 Edward L. Shaughnessy 编著的《剑桥中国古代史：从文明的起源到公元前 221 年》（The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.）。我还借鉴了李丰关于西周的著作、尤里-派恩斯关于春秋战国哲学发展的著作，以及司马迁《史记》中的一些内容--就其价值而言，《史记》是另一部值得一读的中国古代史学著作（一般认为是中国古代史学著作，是为其他帝王史建立典范的著作）。 _Shiji_, there are numerous translations of the short-story-length biographies of various Spring and Autumn, Warring States, Qin, and early Han figures.[‘The Biography of Wu Zixu’](https://d-nb.info/1144806909/34) is the most notable account of a historical figure also present in the _Zuozhuan_.  

虽然《史记》全书没有完整的英译本，但其中有许多关于春秋、战国、秦和汉初人物的短篇传记译本。伍子胥传》是《左传》中最著名的历史人物传记。

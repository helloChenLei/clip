Back in 2011, the field of psychology went into crisis.  

早在 2011 年，心理学领域就陷入了危机。  

Some of the most famous and widely-cited experimental results — like the finding that powerfully posing for a few minutes gives you a hormonal boost in confidence, or that priming people with words to do with ageing makes them walk faster — could not be replicated by others.  

一些最著名、最广为人知的实验结果--比如，摆出强有力的姿势几分钟就能让人荷尔蒙分泌旺盛，信心倍增；或者，用与衰老有关的词语引导人们，能让他们走得更快--都无法被其他人复制。  

These were findings published in the field’s most prestigious academic journals, and going back for decades.  

这些研究成果发表在该领域最负盛名的学术期刊上，而且可以追溯到几十年前。  

Many of them had made mistakes in the experiments, through negligence, unintended bias, or simple error. A few, quite simply, had been faked.  

他们中的许多人在实验中由于疏忽、无意的偏差或简单的错误而犯错。还有一些，很简单，是伪造的。  

Whole swathes of research and media coverage, including some globally best-selling books, turned out to be based on foundations of sand.  

大量的研究和媒体报道，包括一些全球畅销书，都被证明是建立在沙土基础之上的。  

And since then, more and more scientific fields have turned out to have been the victims of replication crises.  

此后，越来越多的科学领域被证明是复制危机的受害者。

Nobody had bothered, for years and years, to go to the trouble of actually checking the more unusual and interesting findings.  

多年来，没有人费心费力地去核实那些更不寻常、更有趣的发现。  

The Scottish psychologist-turned-science journalist Stuart Ritchie wrote an eye-opening book about the scandals in science called _[Science Fictions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Fictions-Epidemic-Fraud-Negligence/dp/1847925650)._ He and another science journalist, Tom Chivers, have also lately started a podcast to sort the reliable findings from the media froth, diving into the details of what scientific studies actually show — it’s called [The Studies Show](https://www.thestudiesshowpod.com/) (har har).  

苏格兰心理学家出身的科学记者斯图尔特-里奇（Stuart Ritchie）写了一本关于科学丑闻的书，名为《科学虚构》（Science Fictions），令人大开眼界。他和另一位科学记者汤姆-奇弗斯（Tom Chivers）最近还开设了一个播客，从媒体的泡沫中整理出可靠的研究结果，深入探讨科学研究的实际细节--这就是《研究秀》（The Studies Show）（哈哈哈）。

But I’ve become increasingly worried that science’s replication crises might pale in comparison to what happens all the time in history, which is not just a replication crisis but a reproducibility crisis.  

但我越来越担心，与历史上经常发生的情况相比，科学的复制危机可能显得苍白无力，这不仅仅是复制危机，而是可再现性危机。  

Replication is when you can repeat an experiment with new data or new materials and get the same result. Reproducibility is when you use exactly the _same_ evidence as another person and still get the same result — so it has a much, much lower bar for success, which is what makes the lack of it in history all the more worrying.  

复制是指你可以用新数据或新材料重复实验，并得到相同的结果。可重复性是指你使用与他人完全相同的证据，仍能得到相同的结果--因此，它的成功门槛要低得多，这也是历史上缺乏可重复性的原因，更令人担忧。

Historical myths, often based on mere misunderstanding, but occasionally on bias or fraud, spread like wildfire.  

历史神话往往仅仅基于误解，但偶尔也会基于偏见或欺诈，它们像野火一样蔓延开来。  

People just love to share unusual and interesting facts, and history is replete with things that are both unusual and true. So much that is surprising or shocking _has_ happened, that it can take only years or decades of familiarity with a particular niche of history in order to smell a rat.  

Not only do myths spread rapidly, but they survive — far longer, I suspect, than in scientific fields.  

神话不仅传播速度快，而且存活时间长--我猜想，比科学领域的神话存活时间要长得多。  

人们喜欢分享不寻常和有趣的事实，而历史上充满了既不寻常又真实的事情。发生过如此多令人惊讶或震惊的事情，以至于只需数年或数十年熟悉某一特定历史领域，就能嗅出其中的蛛丝马迹。

Take the oft-repeated idea that more troops were sent to quash the Luddites in 1812 than to fight Napoleon in the Peninsular War in 1808. Utter nonsense, as [I set out in 2017](https://www.antonhowes.com/blog/were-more-troops-sent-to-quash-the-luddites-than-to-fight-napoleon), though it has been cited again and again and again as fact ever since Eric Hobsbawm first misled everyone back in 1964. Before me, only a handful of niche military history experts seem to have noticed and were largely ignored.  

Despite being busted, it continues to spread. Terry Deary (of就拿人们经常提到的一个观点来说，1812年派去镇压卢德分子的军队比1808年在半岛战争中与拿破仑作战的军队还要多。正如我在2017年所指出的那样，这完全是一派胡言，尽管自从埃里克-霍布斯鲍姆在1964年首次误导大家以来，这种说法就被一而再、再而三地当作事实引用。在我之前，似乎只有少数几位小众军事史专家注意到了这一点，而且基本上被忽视了。 _Horrible Histories_ fame), to give just one of many recent examples, [repeated the myth](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Peasants_Revolting_Lives/kxnhDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) in a 2020 book. Historical myths are especially zombie-like. Even when disproven, they just. won’t. die.  

尽管已被戳穿，但它仍在继续传播。特里-迪尔瑞（《恐怖历史》的作者）在 2020 年出版的一本书中重复了这一神话，这只是最近众多例子中的一个。历史神话尤其像僵尸。即使被推翻，它们也死而不僵。

Or take the case of the 12,000-franc prize instituted by Napoleon for an improved method of preserving food for the use of his armies, which prompted Nicolas Appert to invent canned food.  

拿破仑曾设立 12000 法郎的奖金，奖励他改进保存食物的方法供军队使用，这促使尼古拉-阿贝尔发明了罐头食品。  

It’s frequently cited to show the how prizes can have a significant impact. Except that, despite being repeated _hundreds_ of times, it literally never happened.  

Appert was given money by the French government, but it was a mere reward in recognition of his achievement, given over a decade after he had invented the method.  

法国政府给了阿佩尔一笔钱，但这只是对他的成就的奖励，而且是在他发明这种方法十多年后才给的。  

The myth of the food canning innovation prize is a truly ancient one,它经常被引用来说明奖项如何能产生重大影响。只是，尽管它被重复了数百次，却从未发生过。 [which I traced back](https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-myth-busting-innovation) to a mis-translation of a vaguely-worded French source all the way back in 1869. That’s over 150 years of repeated falsehood, and I see no signs of it slowing.  

食品罐头创新奖的神话是一个真正的古老神话，我追溯到 1869 年对一份措辞含糊的法文资料的错误翻译。150多年来，这种谬论不断重演，而且没有任何减缓的迹象。

The persistence of historical falsehoods is easy to explain. Just as in science, there is simply no time to check absolutely every detail in the things you cite.  

历史谬误的持续存在很容易解释。就像在科学领域一样，我们根本没有时间去检查你所引用的事物中的每一个细节。  

And even if you do, you may have to follow a citation chain that is dozens or hundreds of links long.  

即使你这样做了，你也可能不得不遵循一个长达几十或几百个链接的引用链。  

They will often end up with archival sources that would be too time-consuming to be worth going to the trouble of accessing.  

他们最终往往会找到一些耗时过长、不值得费力查阅的档案资料。  

History, like any other field, very often relies on trust.  

与其他领域一样，历史往往依赖于信任。

But it’s hard to trust when you are exposed to one of the most frightening of revelations: that hardly anyone ever bothers to check.  

但是，当你接触到一个最可怕的启示时，就很难相信了：几乎没有人去检查过。

I don’t think this is just me being grumpy and pedantic. I come across examples of mistakes being made and then spreading almost daily. It is utterly pervasive.  

我不认为这只是我的脾气暴躁和迂腐。我几乎每天都会遇到犯了错误又被传播的例子。这种现象无处不在。  

Last week when chatting to my friend [Saloni Dattani](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile), who has lately been writing a piece on the story of the malaria vaccine, I shared my mounting ~paranoia~ healthy scepticism of secondary sources and suggested she check up on a few of the references she’d cited just to see. A few days later and Saloni was horrified.  

When she actually looked closely, many of the neat little anecdotes she’d cited in her draft — like Louis Pasteur viewing some samples under a microscope and having his mind changed on the nature of malaria — turned out to have no actual underlying primary source from the time.  

当她真正仔细观察时，发现她在草稿中引用的许多巧妙的趣闻轶事--比如路易-巴斯德在显微镜下观察一些样本，并改变了他对疟疾本质的看法--原来都没有来自当时的真实原始资料。  

It may as well have been fiction.  

还不如说是虚构的。  

And there was inaccuracy after inaccuracy, often inexplicable: one history of the World Health Organisation’s malaria eradication programme said it had been planned to take 5-7 years, but the sources actually said 10-15; a graph showed cholera pandemics as having killed a million people, with no citation, while the main sources on the topic actually suggest that in 1865-1947 it killed some 12 million people in British India alone.  

还有一些不准确的地方，常常令人费解：关于世界卫生组织根除疟疾计划的一部历史说，该计划原计划需要 5-7 年时间，但资料来源实际上说需要 10-15 年；一张图表显示霍乱大流行造成一百万人死亡，但没有引文，而关于该主题的主要资料来源实际上表明，1865-1947 年，仅在英属印度就有约 1200 万人死于霍乱。  

上周，我和朋友萨洛尼-达塔尼（Saloni Dattani）聊天时，她最近正在写一篇关于疟疾疫苗故事的文章，我和她分享了我对二手资料来源日益增长的偏执健康的怀疑态度，并建议她检查一下她引用的一些参考文献。几天后，萨洛尼大吃一惊。

Now, it’s shockingly easy to make these mistakes — something I still do embarrassingly often, despite being constantly worried about it.  

现在，犯这些错误简直易如反掌--尽管我一直为此忧心忡忡，但还是经常犯这种令人尴尬的错误。  

When you write a lot, you’re bound to make some errors. You have to pray they’re small ones and try to correct them as swiftly as you can.  

当你经常写作时，难免会犯一些错误。你必须祈祷它们都是小错误，并尽快改正它们。  

I’m extremely grateful to the handful of subject-matter experts who will go out of their way to point them out to me.  

我非常感谢那些不厌其烦地为我指出这些问题的专家。  

But the sheer pervasiveness of errors also allows unintentionally biased narratives to get repeated and become embedded as certainty, and even perhaps gives cover to people who purposefully make stuff up.  

但是，错误的普遍存在也会让那些无意中带有偏见的叙述被重复，并成为确定无疑的事实，甚至可能会给那些故意编造的人提供掩护。

If the lack of replication or reproducibility is a problem in science, in history nobody even thinks about it in such terms. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone systematically looking at the same sources as another historian and seeing if they’d reach the same conclusions.  

如果说缺乏复制或再现性是科学领域的一个问题，那么在历史学领域，甚至没有人从这个角度考虑过这个问题。我想我从未听说过有人会系统地研究与另一位历史学家相同的资料来源，看看他们是否会得出相同的结论。  

Nor can I think of a history paper ever being retracted or corrected, as they can be in science.  

我也想不出有哪篇历史论文会像科学论文那样被撤回或更正。  

At the most, a history journal might host a back-and-forth debate — sometimes delightfully acerbic — for the closely interested to follow.  

最多，历史期刊可能会举办一场来来回回的辩论--有时是令人愉悦的尖锐辩论--供密切关注的人关注。  

In the 1960s you could find an agricultural historian saying of another that he was “of course entitled to express his views, however bizarre.” But many journals will no longer print those kinds of exchanges, they’re hardly easy for the uninitiated to follow, and there is often a strong incentive to shut up and play nice (unless they happen to be a peer-reviewer, in which case some will feel empowered by the cover of anonymity to be extraordinarily rude).  

在 20 世纪 60 年代，你会发现一位农业历史学家对另一位农业历史学家说，他 "当然有权表达自己的观点，无论多么离奇"。但是，许多期刊不再刊登这类交流文章，不了解情况的人很难理解，而且人们往往有强烈的动机闭上嘴巴装好人（除非他们碰巧是同行评议人，在这种情况下，有些人会觉得匿名的掩护赋予了他们权力，可以非常粗鲁）。

This lack of effective institutions or incentives was really brought home to me recently by the publication of a paper in the prestigious journal _History & Technology_ by Jenny Bulstrode of UCL, in which she claimed that the inventor Henry Cort had stolen his famous 1783 iron-rolling process from Reeder’s iron mill in Jamaica, where it had been developed by 76 black metallurgists by passing iron through grooved sugar rollers.  

It was a widely-publicised paper, receiving 22,756 views — eleven times as many views as the journal’s next most most read paper, and frankly unheard of for most academic papers — along with a huge amount of press coverage.  

这是一篇广为传播的论文，共获得了 22756 次浏览量--是该期刊次高阅读量论文的 11 倍，坦率地说，这在大多数学术论文中是闻所未闻的--同时还获得了大量的媒体报道。  

最近，伦敦大学洛杉矶分校的珍妮-布尔斯特罗德（Jenny Bulstrode）在著名期刊《历史与技术》（History & Technology）上发表了一篇论文，她在文中声称，发明家亨利-科特（Henry Cort）从牙买加的里德炼铁厂（Reeder's iron mill）窃取了他著名的 1783 年轧铁工艺。

Bulstrode argued that Cort had heard of the invention via a relative, the master of the ship _Abby_, who had been in Jamaica and in November 1781 visited him in Portsmouth; that in March-May 1782 Reeder’s mill was destroyed by the British army on the pretext that it might be used for weapons in a slave revolt during wartime, but that this was really at the behest of Cort to destroy the competition; and that the grooved rolling machines at Reeder’s mill were dismantled and sent to Portsmouth where Cort could use them.  

布尔斯特罗德辩称，科特是通过一位亲戚，即 "艾比 "号船主听说这一发明的，这位船主曾在牙买加，并于 1781 年 11 月到朴茨茅斯拜访了科特；1782 年 3 月至 5 月，里德的轧机被英军摧毁，借口是它可能会在战时奴隶起义中被用作武器，但这其实是科特的授意，目的是消灭竞争对手；里德轧机的槽形轧机被拆卸并运往朴茨茅斯，科特可以在那里使用它们。

When I wrote about Bulstrode’s paper [last month](https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-cort-case?publication_id=18480&isFreemail=true), I noted that she had not actually presented evidence for the claims that received so much press attention — something that ought to have been picked up by the journal’s peer reviewers.  

She presented no evidence that there was any invention at Reeder’s mill, nor that an invention was derived there in the way she claimed.  

她没有提供证据证明里德的工厂有任何发明，也没有证据证明她所声称的发明是在那里产生的。  

I pointed out that the grooves on sugar rollers were entirely different to those used in Cort’s iron process.  

我指出，糖辊上的凹槽与科特炼铁工艺中使用的凹槽完全不同。  

This could be seen from carefully reading Bulstrode’s paper itself, and taking her citations (if not her claims) at face value.  

仔细阅读布尔斯特罗德的论文本身就能发现这一点，并相信她的引文（如果不是她的说法的话）的真实性。  

上个月，当我写到布尔斯特罗德的论文时，我注意到她并没有为那些受到媒体广泛关注的说法提供实际证据--这一点本应被期刊的同行评审人员注意到。

But things go from worrying to worse.  

但事情却越来越糟。  

After writing it, I was contacted by Oliver Jelf, currently completing a Masters thesis, who had actually bothered to go and check the main sources that Bulstrode cites, and has not only examined her interpretation of the sources in detail, but has [transcribed those same sources for anyone to read](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rp5ae/) and judge for themselves. Jelf notes that significant parts of Bulstrode’s story do not follow from the evidence she cites:  

写完这篇文章后，正在完成硕士论文的奥利弗-杰尔夫与我取得了联系，他真的费心去查证了布尔斯特罗德引用的主要资料来源，不仅详细研究了她对资料来源的解释，还抄录了这些资料来源，供任何人阅读并自行判断。杰尔菲指出，布尔斯特罗德故事的重要部分与她引用的证据不符：

> The sources instead suggest that ordinary and widespread ironmaking processes were in use at Reeder’s foundry; that no innovation occurred there; that the chain of events by which Cort is supposed to have heard of the foundry’s activities certainly did not occur; that Reeder’s foundry was destroyed because of the threat of a Franco-Spanish invasion force; and that no part of the foundry was removed from the immediate vicinity of the island, let alone taken to Portsmouth  
> 
> 相反，这些资料表明，里德的铸造厂当时使用的是普通而普遍的炼铁工艺；铸造厂没有进行任何创新；科特听说铸造厂活动的一系列事件肯定没有发生；里德的铸造厂被毁是因为受到了法国-西班牙入侵部队的威胁；铸造厂的任何部分都没有从该岛附近移走，更不用说运到朴茨茅斯了。

In science terms, if you were to read those same sources before reading Bulstrode’s arguments, there is absolutely no way that you would derive the same conclusions as her . If you simply read the same primary sources that Bulstrode did and tried to create a narrative from them, I can’t see how you’d simply get anything more interesting than the following: “Reeder was the well-connected owner of a very ordinary iron foundry in Jamaica, which was profitable because it used slave labour and had very little competition on the island.  

用科学术语来说，如果你在阅读布尔斯特罗德的论点之前阅读这些相同的资料，你绝对不可能得出与她相同的结论。如果你只是阅读与布尔斯特罗德相同的原始资料，并试图从中创造出一种叙事方法，我看不出你会得到比以下内容更有趣的东西："里德是牙买加一家非常普通的铸铁厂的老板，因为使用奴隶劳动，而且在岛上几乎没有竞争对手，所以利润丰厚。  

In 1782, at the behest of panicked islanders, the military governor of Jamaica reluctantly razed the mill to the ground because of a rumoured imminent Franco-Spanish invasion, with some of the foundry’s weapons and ammunition temporarily brought onto British warships until the threat had passed.  

1782 年，在惊慌失措的岛民的要求下，牙买加军事总督不情愿地将工厂夷为平地，因为传闻法国和西班牙即将入侵，铸造厂的一些武器和弹药暂时被运到英国军舰上，直到威胁过去。  

Oh, and in 1781 a distant relative of Henry Cort once sailed from Jamaica to Lancaster, which is nowhere near to where Cort was based in Portsmouth.” What I simply cannot fathom, now that I’ve read her sources thanks to Jelf’s transcriptions, is how Bulstrode arrived at her narrative at all.  

哦，1781 年，亨利-科特的一个远房亲戚曾从牙买加驶往兰开斯特，而兰开斯特离科特在朴茨茅斯的基地远得很"。由于杰尔夫的转录，我现在读到了她的资料来源，但我根本无法理解的是，布尔斯特罗德到底是如何得出她的叙述的。

What Jelf’s initiative reveals, I think, is a potential solution to at least some of the problems that history faces.  

我认为，杰尔夫的倡议所揭示的，是解决历史面临的至少一些问题的潜在办法。  

Just as in the sciences it is considered good practice to make one’s data available, in history it should perhaps be a requirement to upload to some public repository the photographs or transcriptions of any cited archival sources that are not otherwise freely accessible online.  

就像在科学领域，公开自己的数据被认为是一种良好做法一样，在历史学领域，或许也应该要求将任何引用的档案资料的照片或誊本上传到某个公共存储库，否则就不能在网上免费获取。  

This would not only help peer-reviewers assess a historian’s narrative — something that they frankly cannot do without going and reviewing those same sources for themselves — but would also hugely accelerate the rate at which historical work is digitised and made more available.  

这不仅有助于同行评审人员评估历史学家的叙述--坦率地说，如果他们不亲自去查阅这些资料，就无法做到这一点--而且还将大大加快历史著作数字化的速度，并使其更易于获取。  

You would not believe the sheer volume of photographs and transcriptions that thousands of historians have _already_ made of various archival sources, which circulate only privately at best, but are usually never shared at all.  

We’ve already digitised so much, but have nowhere to put it — nor really much incentive to make it public.  

我们已经数字化了很多东西，但却无处安放，也没有动力将其公之于众。  

你不会相信，成千上万的历史学家已经对各种档案资料进行了大量的拍照和誊写，但这些资料充其量只是私下流传，通常根本不会共享。

Some of the more specialised journals still publish full transcriptions of newly-recognised archival sources, often with expert commentary and interpretation.  

一些专业性较强的期刊仍在刊登新获认可的档案资料的全文转录，通常还附有专家评注和解释。  

You occasionally see it in some PhD theses still. It used to be very common in the late nineteenth century.  

你偶尔还能在一些博士论文中看到它。这种情况在十九世纪末曾经非常普遍。  

But it really ought to be a matter of course, treated in the same way as a scientist’s data, and perhaps even revered.  

但这确实应该是理所当然的事，应该与科学家的数据一样对待，甚至应该受到尊重。  

We need to change the incentives that historians face, so that making new sources available becomes one of the most lauded and rewarded things that they can do.  

我们需要改变历史学家所面临的激励机制，使提供新的资料来源成为他们所能做的最值得称赞和奖励的事情之一。

In the wake of the infamous 2011 replication crisis, a growing number of people have become actively concerned with how to shape the incentives and institutions that scientists face, to reduce the space for fraud, error, bias, and hype, as well as to improve the quality of science more generally — as much a movement as a field of study, allied under the label of “metascience”.  

在 2011 年臭名昭著的复制危机之后，越来越多的人开始积极关注如何塑造科学家所面临的激励机制和体制，以减少欺诈、错误、偏见和炒作的空间，并从总体上提高科学的质量--这既是一场运动，也是一个研究领域，它们被称为 "元科学"。  

I hope that history will see a similar movement. If we’re to maintain trust in historians, it could certainly do with it.  

我希望历史学也能看到类似的运动。如果我们要保持对历史学家的信任，肯定需要这样做。

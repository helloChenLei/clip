When you read in the news that a person whom you know as rich and wealthy is in financial trouble or has declared bankruptcy, it is easy to feel a sense of futility about managing your own money.  

当你从新闻中读到一个你所熟知的富豪陷入财务困境或宣布破产时，很容易对自己的理财产生一种徒劳感。  

You start to think that if such a rich person, who has access to the best financial advice, can come to this state, what chance do I have?  

你会开始想，如果这样一个能获得最佳财务建议的有钱人都能来到这个国家，我还有什么机会呢？

If you read deeper into his or her story you will find that he has come to this state because he violated some basic rule of life. **The Golden Rules of Financial Safety of Harry Browne** are the basic rules for financial success. They are simple and obvious and if you abide by them, there is less chance than one in a million that you could lose all that you have….  

如果你深入了解他或她的故事，你会发现他之所以落到如此地步，是因为他违反了一些基本的生活准则。哈里-布朗的《财务安全黄金法则》是财务成功的基本法则。这些规则简单明了，如果你能遵守这些规则，你失去一切的可能性就会小于百万分之一....。

Let us learn what they are…  

让我们了解它们是什么

**Your career 您的职业生涯**

**Rule 1: Your career provides your wealth  

规则 1：事业为你提供财富**

Build your wealth upon your career.You most likely will make far more money from your business or profession than from your investments.  

将你的财富建立在你的事业上。你很可能会从你的生意或职业中赚到比投资多得多的钱。  

Only very rarely does someone make a large fortune from investments.  

只有极少数人能从投资中赚取巨额财富。  

Your investments can make your future more secure and your retirement more prosperous. But they can’t take you from rags to riches.  

投资可以让你的未来更有保障，让你的退休生活更加富足。但是，投资并不能让您从贫穷走向富裕。  

So don’t take risks with complicated schemes in the hope of multiplying your capital quickly.  

因此，不要为了快速实现资本倍增而冒险实施复杂的计划。  

Your investment plan should be aimed, first and foremost, at preserving what you have—preserving it from investment loss, government intervention, or mismanagement.  

您的投资计划首先应着眼于保护您所拥有的资产--使其免受投资损失、政府干预或管理不善的影响。  

Most part-time investors who try to beat the markets lose part or all the savings they’ve worked so hard to accumulate.  

大多数试图战胜市场的兼职投资者都会失去部分或全部辛苦积累的积蓄。  

Can you make big profits by relying on an expert who does have the proper qualifications? How do you find a true expert? That task is no easier than picking the right investments.  

您是否可以依靠确实具备适当资格的专家赚取高额利润？如何找到真正的专家？这项任务并不比挑选正确的投资项目容易。  

If you don’t understand investing as well as the pros, you won’t know how to check those who seek to advise you.  

如果你不像专业人士那样了解投资，你就不知道如何去检查那些想给你提供建议的人。  

And you can’t rely on an advisor’s track record, even when it’s presented honestly. Track records tell you only how advisors did in the past – not how they will do next year.  

你不能依赖顾问的业绩记录，即使它是真实的。跟踪记录只能告诉你顾问过去的业绩，而不能告诉你他们明年的业绩。  

You’re violating Rule #1 if you think your investments can be the sole source of your retirement wealth – or if you steal time from your work to manage your investments – or if you think about abandoning your job to become a full-time investor.  

如果你认为你的投资可以成为你退休后财富的唯一来源--或者如果你从工作中偷出时间来管理你的投资--或者如果你想放弃工作成为一名全职投资者，那么你就违反了规则 1。

**Your Wealth May Be Non-Replaceable  

您的财富可能不可替代**

**Rule 2: Don’t assume you can replace your wealth.  

规则 2：不要假设你能取代你的财富。**

The fact that you earned what you have doesn’t mean that you could earn it again if you lost it. Markets and opportunities change, technology changes, laws change.  

你所拥有的一切是你自己挣来的，但这并不意味着如果你失去了它，你还能再挣回来。市场和机会在变，技术在变，法律也在变。  

Conditions today may be considerably different from what they were when you built the estate you have now.  

今天的条件可能与您建造现在的房产时大不相同。  

And as time passes, increasing regulation makes it harder and harder to amass a fortune.  

随着时间的推移，监管的不断加强使得积累财富变得越来越难。  

So treat what you have as though you could never earn it again. Don’t take chances with your wealth on the assumption that you could always get it back.  

因此，对待你所拥有的一切，就像你永远不可能再赚到它一样。不要抱着 "你总能把它赚回来 "的侥幸心理来对待你的财富。  

You earned your wealth because your talent and effort harmonized with the circumstances in which you found yourself.  

你之所以能赢得财富，是因为你的才能和努力与你所处的环境相协调。  

But the world won’t stand still for you or repeat itself when you need it to.  

但世界不会为你停滞不前，也不会在你需要的时候重演。  

So assume that what you have now is irreplaceable, that you could never earn it again – even if you suspect you could.  

所以，假设你现在所拥有的是不可替代的，你永远不可能再赚到它--即使你怀疑自己可以。  

Say “No!” to any proposition that asks you to risk losing it.  

对任何要求你冒着失去它的风险的提议说 "不！"。

**Investing vs. Speculating  

投资与投机**

**Rule 3: Recognize the difference between investing and speculating.  

规则 3：认清投资与投机的区别。**

When you invest, you accept the return the markets are paying investors in general.  

当你进行投资时，你接受的是市场支付给一般投资者的回报。  

When you speculate, you attempt to beat that return — to do better than other investors are doing — through astute timing, forecasting, or stock selection, and with the implied belief that you’re smarter than most other investors.  

当你进行投机时，你试图通过精明的时机选择、预测或选股来超越收益率，比其他投资者做得更好，并隐含着你比其他大多数投资者更聪明的信念。

You’re speculating when:  

你在猜测什么时候：

1.  You select individual stocks, mutual funds, or stock market sectors you believe will do better than the market as a whole.  
    
    你选择你认为会比整个市场表现更好的个股、共同基金或股市板块。
2.  You move your capital in and out of markets according to how well you think they’ll perform in the near future.  
    
    你根据自己对市场近期表现的判断，将资金转入或转出市场。
3.  You base your investments on current prospects for the nation’s economy.  
    
    您的投资基于当前国家经济的前景。
4.  You use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, cyclical analysis, or any other form of analysis or system to tell you when to buy and sell.  
    
    您可以使用基本面分析、技术分析、周期分析或任何其他形式的分析或系统来告诉您何时买卖。

There’s nothing wrong with speculating — provided you do it with money you can afford to lose.  

投机并没有错--只要你用你输得起的钱去投机。  

But the money that’s precious to you shouldn’t be risked on a bet that you can outperform other investors.  

但是，对你来说弥足珍贵的资金，不应该冒险去赌你能比其他投资者更胜一筹。

**Forecasting the Future 预测未来**

**Rule 4: No one can predict the future.  

规则 4：没有人能预测未来。**

Beware of fortune tellers.  

小心算命先生。  

Events in the investment markets result from the decisions of millions of different people.  

投资市场上的事件是由数百万不同的人做出的决定造成的。  

Investor advisors have no more ability to predict the future actions of human beings than psychics and fortune-tellers do. And so events never unfold as we were so sure they would.  

投资顾问预测人类未来行为的能力，并不亚于灵媒和算命先生。因此，事件永远不会像我们所确信的那样发展。  

Yes, there have been forecasts that came true. But the only reason we notice them is because it’s so exceptional for even one to come true.  

是的，曾经有预报成真。但我们注意到它们的唯一原因是，哪怕只有一个预报成真，也是非常罕见的。  

We forget about all the failed predictions because they’re so commonplace.  

我们忘记了所有失败的预测，因为它们太平常了。  

No one can reliably tell you what stocks will do next year, whether we’ll have more inflation, or how the economy will perform.  

没有人能可靠地告诉你明年股票会怎么走，我们是否会有更多的通货膨胀，或者经济表现会如何。  

As with the rest of your life, safety doesn’t come from trying to peer into the future to eliminate uncertainty. Safety comes from devising realistic ways to deal with uncertainty.  

与你生活的其他方面一样，安全并不来自于试图窥探未来以消除不确定性。安全来自于制定现实的方法来应对不确定性。  

We live in an uncertain world – and that no one can eliminate the uncertainty for you.  

我们生活在一个不确定的世界，没有人能为你消除这种不确定性。  

Look for ways to assure that the uncertain future won’t hurt you – no matter what it turns out to be.  

想方设法确保不确定的未来不会伤害你--无论结果如何。

**Investment Advice 投资建议**

**Rule 5: No one can move you in and out of investments consistently with precise and profitable timing.  

规则 5：没有人可以让你在精确的盈利时机持续进出投资。**

Don’t expect anyone to make you rich.  

不要指望任何人能让你致富。  

You’ll hear about many Wall Street wizards, but the investment advisor with the perfect record up to now most likely will lose his touch the moment you start acting on his advice.  

你会听到很多华尔街奇才的故事，但迄今为止记录完美的投资顾问很可能在你开始按照他的建议行事的那一刻就失去了他的魅力。  

Investment advisors can be very valuable. A good advisor can help you understand how to do the things you know you need to do.  

投资顾问可能非常有价值。好的顾问可以帮助您了解如何做您知道需要做的事情。  

He can help call your attention to risks you may have overlooked. And he can make you aware of new alternatives.  

他可以帮助你注意到可能被你忽视的风险。他还能让你了解新的替代方案。  

The Helper (accountant, etc) is worth listening to. He or she can acquaint you with investment alternatives you weren’t aware of, and that might be a good fit for you.  

助手（会计师等）值得一听。他（她）可以让你了解到你不知道的、可能适合你的其他投资方式。  

He can teach you the mechanics and procedures for getting things done in the investment world.  

他可以向你传授在投资界做事的技巧和程序。  

He can raise the questions you need to answer in order to devise a portfolio that suits your needs. He can help you reduce the tax bill on your investment profits.  

他可以提出您需要回答的问题，以便设计出适合您需要的投资组合。他可以帮助您降低投资利润的税费。  

You don’t act on the advice of someone you never heard of. And you hear of him only after – and because – he has made several profitable recommendations in a row.  

你不会听从一个你从未听说过的人的建议。只有在他连续提出了几个有利可图的建议之后，你才会听说过他。  

The investment expert with the perfect record up to now will lose his touch as soon as you start acting on his advice.  

一旦你开始按照他的建议行事，迄今为止记录完美的投资专家就会失去联系。  

But no one can guarantee to have you always in the right place at the right time. And worse, attempts to do so can sometimes be fatal to your portfolio.  

但是，没有人能保证你总是在正确的时间出现在正确的地点。更糟糕的是，试图做到这一点有时会对你的投资组合造成致命打击。

**Trading Systems 交易系统**

**Rule 6: No trading system will work as well in the future as it did in the past.  

规则 6：任何交易系统在未来都不会像过去那样有效。**

You’ll come across many trading systems or indicators that seem always to have signaled correctly where your money should have been, but somehow the systems never come through when your money is on the line.  

你会遇到许多交易系统或指标，它们似乎总是能正确地显示出你的资金应该在哪里，但不知为何，当你的资金岌岌可危时，这些系统却从未出现过。  

Trading systems generally arise from one of two sources.  

交易系统一般有两种来源。  

The first source is a commonsense observation about human behavior – which someone then tries to transform into a quantifiable, mechanical system.  

第一个来源是对人类行为的常识性观察，然后有人试图将其转化为可量化的机械系统。  

For example, Contrary Opinion is a theory that says, among other things, that an investment is likely to be near its peak when everyone seems to know how good its prospects are.  

例如，"相反意见"（Contrary Opinion）理论认为，当每个人似乎都知道某项投资的前景有多好时，这项投资就可能接近顶峰。  

The idea makes some sense.  

这个想法有一定道理。  

If everyone already knows something is a good investment, most people who are likely to buy it probably already have done so – leaving very few investors to buy it and push its price still higher.  

如果每个人都知道某样东西是好的投资品，那么大多数可能购买它的人可能已经购买了，只有极少数投资者会购买它，并将其价格推得更高。  

In such a case, you should be skeptical about its prospects as a speculation.  

在这种情况下，你应该对它的投机前景持怀疑态度。  

But that doesn’t mean we know precisely when or at what price the investment will peak. You know only that there doesn’t seem to be room for the price to go much higher.  

但这并不意味着我们能准确知道投资何时或以何种价格达到顶峰。你只知道，价格似乎没有再涨的空间了。  

But people who devise trading systems aren’t satisfied with anything so indefinite.  

但是，设计交易系统的人并不满足于如此不确定的东西。  

They devise indicators to measure the precise degree of bullishness and bearishness surrounding a specific investment – and then construct formulas that provide specific signals for buying and selling.  

他们设计指标，精确测量围绕特定投资的看涨和看跌程度，然后构建公式，提供具体的买卖信号。  

This is similar to taking an obvious truth – such as that attendance at sporting events is generally smaller on rainy days than on sunny days – and constructing a formula that supposedly translates the number of inches of rainfall into an exact forecast of the attendance.  

这就好比把一个显而易见的事实--比如体育赛事的上座率在雨天通常比晴天少--套用一个公式，把降雨量的英寸数转换成上座率的精确预测。  

The second source is probably finding something that has worked in the past and assuming it will work in the future.  

第二个来源可能是找到了过去行之有效的方法，并假定它在未来也行之有效。  

Trading systems are based on the unstated assumption that the world doesn’t change. But the world is in constant change – as desires change, demand changes, and supplies change.  

交易系统建立在一个未加说明的假设之上，即世界不会改变。但世界是在不断变化的--欲望在变化，需求在变化，供应也在变化。

**Operate on a Cash Basis  

按现金制运作**

**Rule 7: Don’t use leverage.  

规则 7：不要使用杠杆。**

When someone goes completely broke, it’s almost always because he used borrowed money.  

当一个人彻底破产时，几乎总是因为他用了借来的钱。  

In many cases, the individual was already quite rich, but he wanted to pyramid his fortune with borrowed money.  

在许多情况下，这些人已经相当富有，但他想用借来的钱使自己的财富成金字塔状。  

Using margin accounts or mortgages (for other than your home) puts you at risk to lose more than your original investment.  

使用保证金账户或抵押贷款（用于房屋以外的其他用途）会使您面临损失超过原始投资的风险。  

If you handle all your investments on a cash basis, it’s virtually impossible to lose everything—no matter what might happen in the world—especially if you follow the other rules given here.  

如果您以现金方式处理您的所有投资，那么无论世界上发生什么事情，您几乎都不可能一无所有，特别是如果您遵守这里给出的其他规则。

**Make Your Own Decisions 做出自己的决定**

**Rule 8: Don’t let anyone make your decisions.  

规则 8：不要让任何人替你做决定。**

Many people lost their fortunes because they gave someone (a financial advisor or attorney) the authority to make their decisions and handle their money.  

许多人之所以倾家荡产，就是因为他们把做决定和处理钱财的权力交给了某个人（财务顾问或律师）。  

The advisor may have taken too many chances, been dishonest, or simply incompetent. But, most of all, no advisor can be expected to treat your money with the same respect you do.  

顾问可能存在过多的侥幸心理、不诚实或根本不称职。但最重要的是，我们不能指望任何顾问会像您一样尊重您的资金。  

You don’t need a money manager. Investing is complicated and difficult to understand only if you’re trying to beat the market.  

你不需要理财经理。只有当你想战胜市场时，投资才会变得复杂难懂。  

You can preserve what you have with only a minimum understanding of investing.  

您只需对投资有最起码的了解，就能保住您所拥有的一切。  

You can set up a worry-proof portfolio for yourself in one day — and then you need only one day a year to monitor it.  

您只需一天时间就能为自己建立一个无忧投资组合，然后每年只需一天时间对其进行监控。  

Allowing the smartest person in the world to make your decisions for you isn’t nearly as safe as setting up a safe portfolio for yourself.  

让世界上最聪明的人为你做决定，还不如为自己建立一个安全的投资组合来得稳妥。  

Above all, never give anyone signature authority over money that’s precious to you.  

最重要的是，永远不要把对你来说很珍贵的钱的签字权交给任何人。  

If you should put money into an account for someone else to manage, it must be money you can afford to lose.  

如果你要把钱存入一个账户让别人管理，那就必须是你输得起的钱。

**Understand What You Do 了解您的工作**

**Rule 9: Don’t ever do anything you don’t understand.  

规则 9：永远不要做你不明白的事情。**

Don’t undertake any investment, speculation, or investment program that you don’t understand. If you do, you may later discover risks you weren’t aware of.  

不要进行任何你不了解的投资、投机或投资计划。如果你这样做了，你以后可能会发现自己没有意识到的风险。  

Or your losses might turn out to be greater than the amount you invested.  

或者你的损失可能会超过你的投资额。  

It’s better to leave your money in Treasury bills than to take chances with investments you don’t fully comprehend.  

与其冒险进行你不完全了解的投资，还不如把钱留在国库券里。  

It doesn’t matter that your brother-in-law, your best friend, or your favorite investment advisor understands some money-making scheme. It isn’t his money at risk.  

你的小舅子、你最好的朋友或你最喜欢的投资顾问了解一些赚钱的计划并不重要。冒风险的不是他的钱。  

If you don’t understand it, don’t do it.  

如果你不理解，就不要去做。

**Diversification 多样化**

**Rule 10: Don’t depend on any one investment, institution, or person for your safety.  

规则 10：不要依赖任何一种投资、机构或个人来保障你的安全。**

Every investment has its time in the sun — and its moment of shame. Precious metals ruled the roost in the 1970s while stocks and bonds were in disgrace.  

每种投资都有它的辉煌时期，也有它的耻辱时刻。20 世纪 70 年代，贵金属一统天下，而股票和债券则黯然失色。  

But then gold and silver became the losers of the 1980s and 1990s, while stocks and bonds multiplied their value. No one investment is good for all times.  

但后来，黄金和白银成了 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代的输家，而股票和债券却身价倍增。没有一种投资适合所有时期。  

Even Treasury bills can lose real value during times of inflation.  

在通货膨胀时期，即使是国库券也会失去实际价值。  

And you can’t rely on any single institution to protect your wealth for you. Old-line banks have failed and pension funds have folded.  

你不能依靠任何一家机构为你保护财富。老牌银行倒闭了，养老基金也倒闭了。  

The company you think will keep your wealth safe might not be there when you’re ready to withdraw your life savings.  

当你准备提取毕生积蓄时，你认为能保证你的财富安全的公司可能已经不在了。  

We live in an uncertain world, and surprises are the norm. You shouldn’t risk the chance that a single surprise will wipe out a large part of your holdings.  

我们生活在一个不确定的世界，意外是常态。你不应该冒一个意外就会使你的大部分资产化为乌有的风险。  

Diversify across investments and institutions – and keep things simple enough to manage yourself – you can relax, knowing that no one event can do you in.  

分散投资和投资机构，让事情简单到自己可以管理，这样你就可以放松，因为你知道没有任何事件会让你陷入困境。

**Balanced Portfolio 平衡投资组合**

**Rule 11: Create a bulletproof portfolio for protection.  

规则 11：建立防弹投资组合以提供保护。**

For the money you need to take care of you for the rest of your life, set up a simple, balanced, diversified portfolio.  

如果你需要一笔钱来照顾自己的余生，那就建立一个简单、平衡、多样化的投资组合。  

I call this a “Permanent Portfolio” because once you set it up, you never need to rearrange the investment mix— even if your outlook for the future changes.  

我之所以称之为 "永久投资组合"，是因为一旦你建立了这个组合，即使你对未来的展望发生了变化，你也不需要重新安排投资组合。  

The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event — including an event that would be devastating to any individual element within the portfolio.  

投资组合应确保您的财富在任何情况下都能经受住考验--包括对投资组合中任何单个要素造成毁灭性打击的情况。  

In other words, this portfolio should protect you no matter what the future brings.  

换句话说，无论未来发生什么，这个投资组合都能为您提供保护。  

It isn’t difficult or complicated to have such a portfolio this safe. You can achieve a great deal of diversification with a surprisingly simple portfolio.  

拥有这样一个安全的投资组合并不难，也不复杂。您可以通过一个出奇简单的投资组合来实现极大的多样化。

The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event – including events that would be devastating to any one investment.Three absolute requirements for such a portfolio are:  

这种投资组合应确保您的财富在任何情况下都能安然无恙--包括对任何一项投资都具有毁灭性的事件：

**1\. Safety:**It should protect you against every possible economic future.  

1.安全：它应保护您免受未来各种可能的经济风险。  

You should profit during times of normal prosperity, but you also should be safe (and perhaps even profit) during bad times – inflation, recession, or even depression.  

在正常繁荣时期，你应该获利，但在不景气时期--通货膨胀、经济衰退甚至萧条--你也应该安全（甚至可能获利）。

**2\. Stability:**Whatever economic climate arrives, the portfolio’s performance should be so steady that you won’t wonder whether the portfolio needs to be changed.  

2.稳定：无论经济环境如何，投资组合的表现都应该非常稳定，以至于你不会怀疑投资组合是否需要改变。  

Even in the worst possible circumstances, the portfolio’s value should drop no more than slightly – so that you won’t panic and abandon it.  

即使在最坏的情况下，投资组合的价值也不应下降太多--这样你才不会惊慌失措，放弃投资组合。  

This stability also permits you to turn your attention away from your investments, confident that your portfolio will protect you in any circumstance.  

这种稳定性还允许您将注意力从投资上转移开，相信您的投资组合在任何情况下都能为您提供保护。

**3\. Simplicity:**The portfolio should be so easy to maintain, and require so little of your time, that you’ll never be tempted to look for something that seems simpler, but is less safe.  

3.简单：投资组合应该非常容易维护，只需要花费很少的时间，这样你就不会去寻找那些看似简单但却不那么安全的投资组合。

You leave it alone – to hold the same investments, in the same proportions, permanently.  

你不去管它--以相同的比例永久持有相同的投资。  

You don’t change the proportions as you, your friends, or investment gurus change their minds about the future.  

你不会因为自己、朋友或投资大师对未来看法的改变而改变比例。

Your portfolio needs to respond well only to those broad movements. And they fit into four general categories:  

您的投资组合只需对这些广泛的变动做出良好的反应。它们可分为四大类：

**1\. Prosperity:**A period during which living standards are rising, the economy is growing, business is thriving, interest rates usually are falling, and unemployment is declining.  

1.繁荣：生活水平提高、经济增长、商业繁荣、利率下降、失业率下降的时期。

**2\. Inflation:**A period when consumer prices generally are rising.  

2.通货膨胀：消费价格普遍上涨的时期。  

They might be rising moderately (an inflation rate of 6% or so), rapidly (10% to 20% or so, as in the late 1970s), or at a runaway rate (25% or more).  

它们可能是温和上升（通胀率为 6% 左右），也可能是快速上升（10% 至 20% 左右，如 20 世纪 70 年代末），或者是以失控的速度上升（25% 或更高）。

**3\. Tight money or recession:**A period during which the growth of the supply of money in circulation slows down.  

3.货币紧缩或衰退：流通中的货币供应量增长放缓的时期。  

This leaves people with less cash than they expected to have, and usually leads to a recession – a period of poor economic conditions.  

这使得人们拥有的现金比预期的要少，通常会导致经济衰退--经济状况不佳的时期。

**4\. Deflation:**The opposite of inflation. Consumer prices decline and the purchasing power value of money grows.  

4.通货紧缩：与通货膨胀相反。消费价格下降，货币的购买力价值增长。  

In the past, deflation has sometimes triggered a depression – a prolonged period of very bad economic conditions, as in the 1930s.  

在过去，通货紧缩有时会引发萧条--经济状况长期非常糟糕，如 20 世纪 30 年代。

Investment prices can be affected by what happens outside the financial system – wars, changes in government policies, new tax rules, civil turmoil, and other matters.  

投资价格会受到金融体系之外发生的事情--战争、政府政策变化、新的税收规则、内乱以及其他事项--的影响。  

But these events have a lasting effect on investments only if they push the economy from one to another of the four environments I’ve just described.  

但是，只有当这些事件将经济从我刚才描述的四种环境中的一种推向另一种时，它们才会对投资产生持久的影响。  

The four economic categories are all-inclusive. At any time, one of them will predominate. So if you’re protected in these four situations, you’re protected in all situations.  

四大经济类别包罗万象。在任何时候，其中一种都会占主导地位。因此，如果你在这四种情况下受到保护，那么你在所有情况下都会受到保护。

Thus four investments provide coverage for all four economic environments:  

因此，四项投资涵盖了所有四种经济环境：

**STOCKS** take advantage of prosperity.  

股票趁繁荣。  

They tend to do poorly during periods of inflation, deflation, and tight money, but over time those periods don’t undo the gains that stocks achieve during periods of prosperity.  

在通货膨胀、通货紧缩和银根紧缩时期，股票往往表现不佳，但随着时间的推移，这些时期并不会抵消股票在繁荣时期取得的收益。

**BONDS** also take advantage of prosperity. In addition, they profit when interest rates collapse during a deflation.  

债券也可以利用繁荣。此外，在通货紧缩期间利率崩溃时，它们也能从中获利。  

You should expect bonds to do poorly during times of inflation and tight money.  

在通货膨胀和银根紧缩时期，债券的表现会很差。

**GOLD** not only does well during times of intense inflation, it does very well. In the 1970s, gold rose twenty times over as the inflation rate soared to its peak of 15% in 1980. Gold generally does poorly during times of prosperity, tight money, and deflation.  

在通货膨胀严重的时期，黄金不仅表现出色，而且非常出色。20 世纪 70 年代，随着通货膨胀率飙升至 1980 年 15%的峰值，黄金上涨了 20 倍。在经济繁荣、银根紧缩和通货紧缩时期，黄金通常表现不佳。

**CASH** is most profitable during a period of tight money.  

现金在资金紧张时期最有利可图。  

Not only is it a liquid asset that can give you purchasing power when your income and investments might be ailing, but the rise in interest rates increases the return on your dollars.  

它不仅是一种流动资产，能在你的收入和投资出现问题时为你提供购买力，而且利率的上升也会增加你的美元回报。  

Cash also becomes more valuable during a deflation as prices fall. Cash is essentially neutral during a time of prosperity, and it is a loser during times of inflation.  

在通货紧缩期间，由于价格下跌，现金也变得更有价值。在经济繁荣时期，现金基本上是中性的，而在通货膨胀时期，现金则会贬值。

Any attempt to be clever in assigning portions to the investments probably will do more harm than good. I prefer the simplicity of allocating 25% to each of the four investments.  

任何试图巧妙分配投资份额的做法都可能弊大于利。我更倾向于简单地为四项投资各分配 25%。

The only maintenance required is to check the portfolio’s makeup once a year.  

唯一需要维护的是每年检查一次投资组合的构成。

If any of the four investments has become worth less than 15%, or more than 35%, of the portfolio’s overall value, you need to restore the original percentages.  

如果四项投资中的任何一项在投资组合总价值中所占比例低于 15%或高于 35%，则需要恢复原来的比例。

When you make your once-a-year check of the portfolio’s value, if all four investments are within the 15-35% range, no rebalancing is necessary.  

当您每年对投资组合的价值进行一次检查时，如果所有四项投资都在 15%-35% 的范围内，则无需重新平衡。  

During the year, if you happen to notice that there’s been a big change in investment prices, you may want to check the values of the investments.  

在这一年中，如果您偶然发现投资价格发生了很大变化，您可能需要检查一下投资的价值。  

Again, if any investment has strayed outside the 15-35% range, go ahead and rebalance the entire portfolio.  

同样，如果有任何投资偏离了 15%-35% 的范围，就继续重新平衡整个投资组合。

The test of a Permanent Portfolio is whether it provides peace of mind.  

检验永久投资组合的标准是它是否能让人安心。  

A Permanent Portfolio should let you watch the evening news or read investment publications in total serenity.  

永久投资组合应能让您安静地收看晚间新闻或阅读投资刊物。  

No actual or threatened event should trouble you, because you’ll know that your portfolio is protected against it.  

任何实际发生或可能发生的事件都不会对您造成困扰，因为您知道您的投资组合受到了保护。

If someone warns about the “alarming parallels” between the current decade and the 1920s, you shouldn’t wonder whether you need to sell all your stocks.  

如果有人警告说，当前的十年与 20 世纪 20 年代有 "惊人的相似之处"，你就不应该怀疑自己是否需要卖掉所有的股票。  

You’ll know that your Permanent Portfolio will take care of you – even if next year turns out to be 1929 revisited.  

你会知道，你的永久投资组合会照顾好你--即使明年变成 1929 年重访。  

The deflation that could devastate stocks would push interest rates downward and bring big profits for your bonds.  

可能摧毁股票的通货紧缩会推动利率下行，为你的债券带来丰厚的利润。

When someone claims the inflation rate is headed back to 15%, you shouldn’t wonder whether to dump all your bonds.  

当有人声称通胀率将回升至 15%时，你不应该怀疑是否要抛售所有债券。  

You’ll know that the gain in your Permanent Portfolio’s gold would far outweigh any losses on the bonds.  

你会知道，永久投资组合中黄金的收益将远远超过债券的损失。

When someone announces that a new debt crisis is on the way, or that a bull market is about to begin in stocks, bonds, or gold, you won’t feel pressured to decide whether he’s right.  

当有人宣布新的债务危机即将来临，或者股票、债券或黄金的牛市即将开始时，你不会感到有压力去判断他是否正确。  

You’ll know that the Permanent Portfolio will respond favorably to any eventuality.  

您将知道，永久投资组合将对任何可能发生的情况做出有利的反应。

I can’t list every potential event.  

我无法一一列举所有可能发生的事件。  

So if you become concerned by any possibility, reread this chapter and you should be reassured that there’s an investment in your Permanent Portfolio that will cover you if the worst should occur.  

因此，如果你对任何可能发生的情况感到担忧，请重读本章，你就会感到放心，因为在你的永久投资组合中，如果发生最坏的情况，也会有一笔投资为你提供保障。  

Whatever the potential crisis or opportunity, your Permanent Portfolio should already be taking care of you.  

无论潜在的危机或机遇是什么，您的永久投资组合都应该已经为您做好了准备。

The portfolio can’t guarantee a profit every year; no portfolio can. It won’t outperform the hotshot advisor in his best year.  

投资组合不能保证每年都盈利，没有任何投资组合能做到这一点。它不会在热门顾问业绩最好的一年超过他。  

And it won’t outperform the best investment of the year.  

它的表现也不会超过今年最好的投资。  

But it can give you the confidence that no crisis will destroy you, the assurance that your savings are secure and growing in all circumstances, and the knowledge that you’re no longer vulnerable to the mistakes in judgment that you or the best advisor could so easily make.  

但它可以给你信心，让你相信任何危机都不会摧毁你，让你确信你的储蓄在任何情况下都是安全和不断增长的，让你知道你不再容易因判断失误而受到伤害，而你或最好的顾问却很容易犯这种错误。

**Speculation 猜测**

**Rule 12: Speculate only with money you can afford to lose.  

规则 12：投机只能用你输得起的钱。**

If you want to try to beat the market, set up a second — separate — portfolio with which you can speculate to your heart’s content.  

如果你想战胜市场，可以建立第二个独立的投资组合，尽情投机。  

But make sure this portfolio contains no more of your wealth than you can afford to lose.  

但要确保这个投资组合所包含的财富不超过你能承受的损失。  

I call this second pool of money a “Variable Portfolio” because its investments will vary as your outlook for the future changes.  

我把第二个资金池称为 "可变投资组合"，因为它的投资会随着你对未来的展望而变化。  

It might be all or part in stocks or gold or something else — whatever looks good at any time — or just in cash.  

可以全部或部分投资于股票、黄金或其他东西--任何时候看起来不错的东西--也可以只投资于现金。  

You can take chances with the Variable Portfolio because you know that, whatever happens, no loss can be devastating.  

您可以利用可变投资组合来冒险，因为您知道，无论发生什么情况，损失都不会是毁灭性的。  

You can lose only the money you’ve already decided isn’t precious to you.  

你只能失去那些你已经决定不再宝贵的钱。

**International Diversification  

国际多样化**

**Rule 13: Keep some assets outside the country in which you live.  

规则 13：在居住国之外保留一些资产。**

Don’t allow everything you own to be where your government can touch it.  

不要让你拥有的一切都被政府触及。  

By having something outside the reach of your government, you’ll be less vulnerable — and you’ll feel less vulnerable.  

有了政府管不着的东西，你就不会那么容易受到伤害--你也不会觉得那么容易受到伤害。  

You’ll no longer have to worry so much about what the government will do next.  

您再也不用担心政府下一步会做什么了。  

For example, maintaining a foreign bank account is quite simple; it’s little different from having a mail or Internet account with an American bank or broker.  

例如，维护一个外国银行账户非常简单；这与在美国银行或经纪商处拥有一个邮件或互联网账户没有什么区别。  

Keeping some investments abroad provides safe and easy protection against surprises that might happen anywhere – confiscation of gold holdings by the government, exchange controls, civil disorder, even war.  

在国外保留一些投资，可以安全、方便地防范任何地方可能发生的意外情况--政府没收黄金、外汇管制、内乱，甚至战争。  

No one knows how the people elected in the coming years might choose to solve the economic problems the country will face.  

没有人知道未来几年当选的人可能会选择如何解决国家将面临的经济问题。  

It might strike them that the quick and easy solution is to take your property – as has happened so often already.  

他们可能会认为，快速而简单的解决办法就是夺走你的财产--这种情况已经屡见不鲜了。  

Your assets will be safe even if war, civil disorder, a weakening of law enforcement, or a physical catastrophe should disrupt record-keeping in your own country.  

即使战争、内乱、执法力量削弱或物质灾难破坏了您本国的记录保存，您的资产也将是安全的。  

Your entire estate will no longer be vulnerable to economic, political, or legal setbacks in your own country.  

您的全部财产将不再受本国经济、政治或法律挫折的影响。  

Geographic diversification is a necessary part of making sure the Permanent Portfolio can handle whatever hazard materializes.  

地域多样化是确保永久投资组合能够应对任何危险的必要组成部分。

**Tax Shelters 避税天堂**

**Rule 14: Beware of tax-avoidance schemes.  

规则 14：谨防避税计划。**

Tax rates are still low enough in the U.S. that you might gain very little from the risk and effort of constructing elaborate tax shelters.  

在美国，税率仍然很低，因此，冒着风险、费尽心机地建造精心设计的避税场所，你可能获益甚微。  

And a great deal of money has been lost by people who hoped to beat the tax system.  

希望战胜税收制度的人们损失了大量金钱。  

The losses came from investments that provided special tax advantages but didn’t make economic sense, and from tax shelters that were disallowed by the IRS — incurring penalties and interest on top of the liabilities.  

这些损失来自于提供特殊税收优惠但没有经济意义的投资，以及被美国国税局驳回的避税措施--除了债务外，还产生了罚金和利息。  

There are a number of simple ways available to minimize taxes — through such things as IRAs and 401(k) plans. Take advantage of these tax reduction plans.  

有很多简单的方法可以最大限度地减少税收--比如通过 IRA 和 401(k) 计划。利用这些减税计划。  

These plans are effective but non-controversial. They won’t come back to haunt you.Tax deferral is the basic method for reducing the tax burden on your investment program.  

这些计划有效但无争议。延税是减轻投资计划税收负担的基本方法。  

With tax deferral, the money you don’t pay in taxes today can work to produce more earnings every year until you finally have to pay the tax.  

通过延税，您现在不用缴税的钱可以每年产生更多的收入，直到您最终必须缴税为止。

**Questions 问题**

**Rule 15: Ask the right questions  

规则 15：提出正确的问题**

In what economic circumstances is the investment’s price likely to go down?  

在什么经济情况下，投资价格可能会下降？  

Are other investments in your portfolio likely to take up the slack by gaining in those same circumstances?  

在同样的情况下，您投资组合中的其他投资项目是否也会获得收益？  

Under what circumstances could I lose a substantial share – 20% or more – of my investment?  

在什么情况下，我可能会损失大量投资（20% 或以上）？  

Under what circumstances could my entire investment be lost?  

在什么情况下，我的全部投资可能会亏损？  

Would I have any residual liability – that is, can I lose even more than the cash I invested?  

我是否会有任何剩余责任，也就是说，我的损失是否会超过我投资的现金？  

Interest rates generally reflect an investment’s risk. A higher interest rate means there’s a greater possibility the capital can be lost – through default or inflation.  

利率通常反映了投资的风险。利率越高，意味着资本因违约或通货膨胀而损失的可能性越大。  

Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to appreciate?  

如果有的话，在什么情况下投资可能升值？  

Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to depreciate?  

如果有的话，在什么情况下投资可能会贬值？  

In good circumstances for the investment, will the overall return – yield plus capital appreciation – help your portfolio overcome losses in other investments?  

在投资环境良好的情况下，整体回报--收益率加上资本增值--能否帮助您的投资组合克服其他投资的损失？  

If the investment is a mutual fund, you want the fund with the lowest yield – other things being equal. Any dividend paid by a mutual fund simply reduces the price of your shares  

如果投资的是共同基金，在其他条件相同的情况下，您应该选择收益率最低的基金。共同基金派发的任何股息都会降低您的股票价格  

“Is this company a potential takeover candidate?”  

"这家公司是潜在的收购对象吗？"  

The crowd isn’t always wrong, but you can’t make much betting with it – because you will buy at a price that’s already high.  

群众的意见并不总是错的，但你不可能利用群众的意见赚很多钱--因为你会在一个已经很高的价格上买进。  

By going against the crowd, you buy when an investment is out of favor and cheap; if it does succeed, there’s a long way for it to go up.  

通过逆向投资，你可以在一项投资不受青睐、价格便宜的时候买入；如果它真的成功了，那么它还有很长的路要走。  

So the most important factor in speculating is whether you expect something that most people don’t expect.  

因此，推测中最重要的因素是，你是否期望得到大多数人都没有期望到的东西。  

For example, the time to consider buying inflation hedges speculatively is when most people believe inflation is under control.  

例如，当大多数人认为通胀受到控制时，就是考虑投机性购买通胀对冲产品的时候。  

The time to consider buying a particular company is when everyone knows what a dog it is – not when everyone talks about its great promise.  

考虑购买某家公司的时机是当所有人都知道它是一条狗的时候，而不是当所有人都在谈论它的巨大前景的时候。  

Unpopularity doesn’t guarantee profits, but you’ll never make a killing with a popular investment.  

不受欢迎并不保证一定能获利，但受欢迎的投资永远不会让你赚得盆满钵满。  

“Do the technical factors favor the investment now?”  

"现在的技术因素是否有利于投资？"  

You must have an investment plan. Without a plan, you will be tossed and turned by all the conflicting ideas you read and hear- – and you’ll never ask the right questions.  

你必须有一个投资计划。如果没有计划，你就会被你读到和听到的所有相互矛盾的观点所折腾--你永远不会提出正确的问题。  

With a plan, you’ll have a basis for evaluating whatever you hear. You’ll know to ask the questions that help you determine whether an investment furthers your plan.  

有了计划，你就有了评估所听到的一切的基础。您将知道如何提出问题，以帮助您确定投资是否有助于您的计划。

**Enjoyment 享受**

**Rule 16: Enjoy yourself with a budget for pleasure.  

规则 16：用预算享受快乐。**

Your wealth is of no value if you can’t enjoy it. But it’s easy to spend too much while the money’s flowing in.  

如果不能享受财富，财富就没有价值。但是，在钱源源不断流入的时候，很容易花得太多。  

To enjoy your wealth, establish a budget of money that you can spend yearly without concern.  

为了享受财富，请制定一个每年都可以放心花掉的资金预算。  

If you stay within that amount, you can feel free to blow the money on cars, trips, anything you want — knowing that you aren’t blowing your future.  

如果不超过这个数额，你就可以放心地把钱花在汽车、旅游和任何你想要的东西上，因为你知道你并没有毁掉你的未来。

**When in Doubt . . .  

当有疑问时 .**

**Rule 17: Whenever you’re in doubt about a course of action, it is always better to err on the side of safety.  

规则 17：无论何时，当你对行动方案有疑问时，最好选择安全的一方。**

If you pass up an opportunity to increase your fortune, another one will be along soon enough.  

如果你放弃了一个增加财富的机会，另一个机会很快就会出现。  

But if you lose your life savings just once, you might never get a chance to replace it.  

但是，如果你只损失了一次毕生积蓄，你可能永远都没有机会补上。  

If you wind up losing something, let it be only an opportunity that was lost – not precious capital. People rarely go broke playing it safe.  

如果你最终失去了什么，那么失去的只是机会，而不是宝贵的资本。人们很少会因为贪图安逸而破产。  

But many go broke taking great risks or making investments they know too little about.  

但是，许多人在冒巨大风险或进行他们所知甚少的投资时破产了。  

If you’re hesitating, it’s because you don’t yet know enough about the investment or the problem to make a confident decision.  

如果您犹豫不决，那是因为您对投资或问题还不够了解，无法做出有把握的决定。  

That means you shouldn’t take the plunge until you know more and you’re sure you understand all the ramifications.  

这意味着，在您了解更多信息并确定自己了解所有后果之前，您不应该贸然行事。  

The premise for speculation is that you’re more astute than most other investors – that you understand the market better, that you have information not available to other investors, that you can make better decisions, or that your interpretation of available information is especially perceptive.  

投机的前提是你比其他大多数投资者更精明--你更了解市场，你拥有其他投资者无法获得的信息，你能做出更好的决定，或者你对现有信息的解读特别敏锐。  

The elements of speculation are timing, forecasting, trading systems, and selection. Any time you use any of these tactics you’re speculating.  

投机的要素包括时机、预测、交易系统和选择。任何时候，只要你使用其中任何一种策略，你就是在投机。  

Investment forecasts can be exciting. But in other areas of our lives, we think of fortune-tellers as entertainers.  

投资预测可能令人兴奋。但在我们生活的其他领域，我们却把算命先生当成了艺人。  

Forecasts are not entirely useless. Someone’s predictions can help you recognize that your own expectations for the future aren’t the only possible outcome.  

预测并非一无是处。别人的预测可以帮助你认识到，你自己对未来的期望并不是唯一可能的结果。  

This can help keep you humble and prudent.  

这有助于保持谦虚谨慎。  

If you come to feel a given event is quite possible but most people disagree with you, the market probably will provide a big payoff if you bet on that event and prove to be right.  

如果你觉得某个事件很有可能发生，但大多数人不同意你的观点，那么如果你在该事件上下注并证明自己是对的，市场很可能会给你带来丰厚的回报。  

So if you like to watch the investment markets closely and you see a potential future that most people are ignoring, you may want to make a small speculation with money you can afford to lose.  

因此，如果你喜欢密切关注投资市场，并且看到了被大多数人忽视的潜在未来，那么你可能想用你能承受损失的钱进行一次小规模投机。  

A sure way to lose what you’ve accumulated is to risk the funds that are precious to you on the idea that some event is inevitable.  

如果认为某些事件不可避免，就拿自己宝贵的资金去冒险，那肯定会血本无归。  

In 1970, the chief gold trader at the largest Swiss bank told a friend of mine that the gold price would never go above $40. When asked how he could be so sure, the trader replied, “Because we control the market.”  

1970 年，瑞士最大银行的首席黄金交易员告诉我的一位朋友，金价永远不会超过 40 美元。当被问及为何如此肯定时，这位交易员回答说："因为我们控制着市场。  

“Insiders” are no more help than fortune tellers or high-priced pros.  

"内行 "并不比算命先生或高价专业人士更有帮助。  

You can protect yourself against the possibility of institutional crisis by using more than one institution.  

您可以通过使用一个以上的机构来保护自己，避免可能出现的机构危机。  

You can protect yourself against the failings of individuals by relying only on yourself.  

只有依靠自己，才能抵御个人的失败。  

And you can protect yourself against investment roller coasters by diversifying across investment markets.  

通过分散投资市场，您可以保护自己免受投资过山车的影响。  

Split the 25% stock-market portion among three mutual funds.  

将 25% 的股票市场部分分给三个共同基金。  

For the bond portion, you don’t want to have to monitor credit risk, so buy only U.S. Treasury bonds. So long as the U.S. government has the ability to tax people or print money to pay its bills, there is virtually no credit risk.  

对于债券部分，您不想监控信用风险，因此只购买美国国债。只要美国政府有能力向人民征税或印钞来支付账单，就几乎不存在信用风险。  

Put the 25% in the Treasury bond issue that currently has the longest time until it matures. That will be close to 30 years.  

将 25% 的资金投入目前到期时间最长的国债。这将接近 30 年。  

Ten years later, the bond will have only 20 years to maturity; at that time replace it with a new 30-year bond.  

10 年后，债券的到期日只有 20 年；届时，用新的 30 年期债券替换它。  

Buy bullion coins – coins whose only value is the gold bullion they contain. They sell for about 3-5% more per ounce than gold bullion.  

购买金币--金币的唯一价值就是其中所含的金条。它们每盎司的售价比金块高出约 3-5%。  

That means a one-ounce coin will sell for about $310-$315 if the price of gold is $300 an ounce.  

这意味着，如果黄金价格为每盎司 300 美元，一盎司金币的售价约为 310 美元至 315 美元。  

The cash portion should be kept in a money market fund investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury securities, so that you don’t have to evaluate credit risk.  

现金部分应存放在只投资短期美国国债的货币市场基金中，这样就不必评估信用风险。  

These securities are safer than bank accounts and other debt instruments.  

这些证券比银行账户和其他债务工具更安全。  

If your cash budget is large enough, divide your holdings between two or three funds – for further protection against the unthinkable.  

如果您的现金预算足够多，可以将您持有的资金分成两到三个基金--以进一步防范万一。  

The value of real estate in your portfolio is indivisible, and everything else must accommodate it.  

投资组合中房地产的价值是不可分割的，其他一切都必须与之相适应。  

Just like a 15-foot piano in the living room, you have to arrange the rest of the furniture around it.  

就像客厅里摆放一架 15 英尺高的钢琴一样，你必须围绕它摆放其他家具。  

Your house is a consumption item – the place where you live and enjoy your life.  

房子是一种消费品，是您居住和享受生活的地方。  

Don’t play games with your Permanent Portfolio. Don’t wait for any investment to become cheaper before you buy it.  

不要玩弄你的永久投资组合。不要等任何投资变得便宜了再买。  

And don’t go overboard investing in something that happens to be doing well now. Just put 25% in each of the four categories.  

而且，不要过分投资于现在表现良好的事物。四类投资各占 25%即可。  

No matter how strong your expectations about the near future, you could easily be mistaken.  

无论你对不久的将来抱有多么强烈的期望，你都很可能搞错。  

And the point of the Permanent Portfolio is to ignore your own expectations and let the portfolio take care of you no matter what may come.  

而永久投资组合的意义就在于，无论将来会发生什么，都不要理会自己的期望，让投资组合来照顾你。  

Fund it with equal portions of all four investments and don’t worry over which is going to do best. It is a package of investments that provides the safety you need.  

以这四种投资的同等比例为其提供资金，不要担心哪种投资会做得最好。一揽子投资可为您提供所需的安全性。  

Tear apart the package and you tear apart the safety.  

撕开包装，就是撕开安全。  

A foreign account in any country outside your own is a tremendous improvement over having everything in your home country. But some countries are more hospitable than others.  

与在本国拥有一切相比，在本国以外的任何国家拥有一个外国账户都是巨大的进步。但有些国家比其他国家更好客。  

And some have legal traditions that protect your privacy.  

有些国家有保护隐私的法律传统。  

I’ve always been partial to Switzerland and Austria, because each has a centuries-old tradition of respecting privacy and fending off inquiries from other governments.  

我一直对瑞士和奥地利情有独钟，因为这两个国家都有尊重隐私和抵御其他国家政府查询的悠久传统。  

If you buy and hold gold through the foreign bank, the gold most likely will be stored within the bank itself.  

如果您通过外国银行购买和持有黄金，黄金很可能就存放在银行内部。  

The secret – that things rarely work out as expected – is shared unwittingly by investors, brokers, advisors, newsletter writers, and financial journalists, few of whom can bring themselves to acknowledge it.  

投资者、经纪人、顾问、时事通讯作者和财经记者都在不知不觉中分享了这个秘密--事情很少能像预期的那样发展，但他们中很少有人能承认这一点。  

Each wants to appear to be in command of the situation, on top of the markets, aware of what’s happening and what’s going to happen – and to appear as though everything that has already happened was anticipated.  

每个人都想让自己看起来掌控全局，站在市场的顶端，了解正在发生的和将要发生的事情，并让自己看起来好像已经发生的一切都在预料之中。  

A professional needs to keep up this guise because he must look sharper than his competitors.  

专业人士需要保持这种伪装，因为他必须看起来比竞争对手更敏锐。  

Even investors often pose as members of the all-knowing – perhaps because no one wants to appear to be the only loser, and everyone else seems to be so smart.  

即使是投资者也经常装成无所不知的人--也许是因为没有人想成为唯一的失败者，而其他人似乎都很聪明。  

When you give up the search for certainty, an enormous burden is lifted from your shoulders.  

当你放弃对确定性的追求时，你肩上的重担就卸下了。  

The less you know – and the more honestly you recognize the limits of your knowledge – the more likely your investment program will turn out okay.  

你知道的越少，越能坦然地认识到自己知识的局限性，你的投资计划就越有可能取得成功。  

Humility is accepting that you don’t know everything, or even everything about any particular topic, and it is an investor’s most vital asset.  

谦虚就是承认自己不了解一切，甚至不了解任何特定主题的一切，这是投资者最重要的资产。  

Arrogance eventually ruins any investor.  

傲慢最终会毁了任何投资者。

**The Rules of Life 生活规则**

The rules of safe investing are little different from the rules of life: recognize that you live in an uncertain world, don’t expect the impossible, and don’t trust strangers.  

安全投资的规则与生活规则没什么不同：认识到你生活在一个不确定的世界，不要期望不可能的事情，不要相信陌生人。  

If you apply to your investments the same realistic attitude that produced your present wealth, you needn’t fear that you’ll ever go broke.  

如果你在投资中采取与创造现有财富时同样的现实态度，你就不必担心自己会破产。

Reputation is old. Personal brands are new. It is useful to know that they are not the same thing.  

声誉是古老的。个人品牌是新的。知道它们不是一回事是很有用的。

I last talked about personal brands in [Personal Brand as Moat, Personal Brand as Soft Landing](https://commoncog.com/personal-brand-as-moat-personal-brand-as-soft-landing/). One of the things that I alluded to in the piece was the idea that reputation isn’t _exactly_ the same thing as a personal brand. I’ve learnt a couple of things since then.  

我上次在《个人品牌是护城河，个人品牌是软着陆》中谈到了个人品牌。我在文章中提到的一个观点是，声誉与个人品牌不完全是一回事。从那时起，我学到了一些东西。

## Personal Brands Are About Projections  

个人品牌是关于预测的

Leonard Lauder, the son of Estée Lauder, was one of the first people to grapple with the implications of personal brand building. In his [autobiography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55892115-the-company-i-keep), he wrote:  

雅诗-兰黛的儿子伦纳德-兰黛是最早努力解决个人品牌建设问题的人之一。在他的自传中，他写道：

> In our early years, we couldn’t really afford to buy advertising.  
> 
> 在我们的早年，我们真的没有能力购买广告。  
> 
> We spent our money instead on sampling in the stores, preparing direct mailers to invite charge customers to receive a gift in the store, and sharing the cost of newspaper ads with our retailers.  
> 
> 我们把钱改用在商店的样品上，准备直接邮件邀请收费顾客到商店领取礼物，并与零售商分担报纸广告的费用。  
> 
> But with my mother on hand, I didn’t have to advertise because she always got the ink.  
> 
> 但有我母亲在身边，我就不用做广告了，因为她总是能拿到墨水。
> 
> My idea was to shine the spotlight on her, to make Estée Lauder the person the living, breathing embodiment of the Estée Lauder Company.
> 
>   
> 
> 我的想法是把焦点放在她身上，让雅诗兰黛这个人成为雅诗兰黛公司的活生生的体现者。  
> 
> She would be the Betty Crocker of the beauty business, only unlike the invented character on the box of cake mix, there was a real Estée Lauder behind the Estée Lauder brand.  
> 
> 她将成为美容行业的贝蒂-克罗克，只是与蛋糕粉盒子上的虚构人物不同，雅诗兰黛品牌背后有一个真正的雅诗兰黛。
> 
> At the same time, my mother understood the importance of creating a character that was larger than life, so she always dressed well, always made sure to get in front of a camera, always was available for interviews.
> 
>   
> 
> 同时，我母亲明白创造一个比生命更重要的角色的重要性，所以她总是穿得很好，总是确保在镜头前出现，总是可以接受采访。  
> 
> It’s been said that 80 percent of success is just showing up. My mother was there—100 percent.  
> 
> 有人说，成功的80%只是出现。我的母亲就在那里--百分之百。

Lauder starting doing this in 1958. You can already see the bones of modern personal brand building in his account.  

劳德在1958年开始这样做。你已经可以从他的账户中看到现代个人品牌建设的骨架。  

The art of turning a person into a brand is essentially the art of building a _projection_ — a model of a person that you want to insert into other people’s heads.  

把一个人变成一个品牌的艺术，本质上是建立一个投影的艺术--一个你想插入其他人头脑中的人的模型。  

Estée Lauder was a real person, of course — an extremely driven entrepreneur, complete with dreams and fears, strengths and weaknesses, virtues and flaws.  

当然，雅诗兰黛是一个真实的人--一个极富动力的企业家，有梦想和恐惧，有优势和劣势，有美德和缺陷。  

Earlier in her career, she couldn't bear to have her husband — Leonard’s father — drag her down, and so she divorced him for a number of years.  

在她职业生涯的早期，她不忍心让她的丈夫--伦纳德的父亲--拖累她，所以她与他离婚了好几年。  

(They did eventually get back together).  

(他们最终确实复合了）。

To create the brand of Estée Lauder, however, Leonard Lauder reduced her to only the core projection that best served the company’s interests.  

然而，为了创建雅诗兰黛的品牌，Leonard Lauder将她缩减到只有最符合公司利益的核心投影。

And it came with its costs:  

而这也是有代价的：

> I knew there would be a price to pay for encouraging my mother to become an icon: the price would be the emotional relationship between mother and son.  
> 
> 我知道，鼓励母亲成为偶像要付出一定的代价：代价是母子之间的情感关系。  
> 
> Our relationship would evolve into more of a professional partnership, marked by mutual respect, between a star and her impresario.  
> 
> 我们的关系将演变成更多的专业伙伴关系，以相互尊重为标志，在一个明星和她的经纪人之间。
> 
> But one of the fundamental tenets of management is to put people in a role where they can most shine.
> 
>   
> 
> 但是，管理的基本原则之一是把人放在最能发挥其作用的地方。  
> 
> Because we were a small company, I had to think about how to best allocate our resources. My mother was one of our most valuable assets. I made it my goal to use her at her best.  
> 
> 因为我们是一家小公司，我不得不考虑如何最好地分配我们的资源。我母亲是我们最宝贵的资产之一。我把使用她的最佳状态作为我的目标。
> 
> That meant deliberately stepping out of the limelight and directing the spotlight on her in her role of master of the beauty universe. I would never compete with her for attention.
> 
>   
> 
> 这意味着我故意不出风头，把聚光灯对准她，让她扮演美丽世界的主人。我永远不会与她争夺注意力。  
> 
> In public, I made a point of never referring to her as “Mom” or even “my mother.” She was “Mrs. Estée Lauder.”  
> 
> 在公开场合，我特别强调永远不要称她为 "妈妈"，甚至 "我妈妈"。她是 "雅诗兰黛夫人"。
> 
> As the company grew, she basked in its success. As for me, I figured that if the company succeeded, I’d succeed, too.
> 
>   
> 
> 随着公司的发展，她沉浸在公司的成功中。至于我，我想，如果公司成功了，我也会成功。

Later, during the Revlon wars, Lauder took the projection and applied it to Karen Graham — the [first ‘face of Estée Lauder’](https://www.esteelauder.com/estee-stories-article-beautys-first-face). Graham was the first model _ever_ to have a beauty contract; Lauder had single-handedly invented the idea of beauty sponsorships. He transitioned the projection just as Estée stepped back into retirement.  

后来，在Revlon的战争中，兰黛将这一预测应用于凯伦-格雷厄姆--第一个 "雅诗兰黛的代言人"。格雷厄姆是有史以来第一个拥有美容合同的模特；劳德一手发明了美容赞助的概念。就在雅诗兰黛重新回到退休状态时，他将这一计划进行了过渡。

The idea of building a projection on social media isn’t a novel one, by any means — Shawn Wang, whom I consider one of the best personal brand builders in the software world, has this to say in his [How To Market Yourself](https://www.swyx.io/marketing-yourself/) guide:  

在社交媒体上建立投影的想法绝不是什么新鲜事--Shawn Wang，我认为是软件世界中最好的个人品牌建设者之一，在他的《如何推销自己》指南中这样说：

> There are other aspects of my personal brand that don't get as much attention. But I bring it up front and center when it is relevant. I changed careers at 30. I used to be in Finance.  
> 
> 我的个人品牌的其他方面并没有得到那么多的关注。但是，当它与之相关时，我就把它提到前面和中心。我在30岁时改变了职业。我以前是做金融的。  
> 
> I served as a Combat Engineer in the Army. I am from Singapore. I speak Mandarin. I've written production Haskell code. I sing Acapella.  
> 
> 我在军队中担任战斗工程师。我来自新加坡。我会说普通话。我写过生产型Haskell代码。我唱阿卡贝拉。  
> 
> I am a humongous Terry Pratchett fan (GNU Terry Pratchett).  
> 
> 我是一个巨大的泰瑞-普拉切特粉丝（GNU Terry Pratchett）。  
> 
> I love Svelte and React and TypeScript. I am passionate about Frontend/CLI tooling and developer experience. I listen to way too many podcasts. The list goes on.  
> 
> 我喜欢Svelte和React以及TypeScript。我热衷于前端/CLI工具和开发者体验。我听了太多的播客。这个名单还在继续。
> 
> But I have this list cold. I know exactly what parts of me spark interest and conversation.
> 
>   
> 
> 但我有这份冷冰冰的清单。我清楚地知道我的哪些部分会引发兴趣和谈话。  
> 
> Therefore I can sustain interest and conversation longer, and people know when to call on me. You should keep a list too - know your strengths and unfair advantages.  
> 
> 因此，我可以维持更长时间的兴趣和谈话，人们也知道什么时候该找我。你也应该保留一份清单--了解你的长处和不公平的优势。
> 
> What I do NOT consider my personal brand is the stuff that doesn't differentiate me at all. For example, when asked about my hobbies, I deflect extremely quickly.
> 
>   
> 
> 我不认为我的个人品牌是那些与我没有任何区别的东西。例如，当被问及我的兴趣爱好时，我很快就会转移话题。  
> 
> I identify as a "Basic Bro" - I have my PS4, and Nintendo Switch, I like Marvel movies and watch the same Netflix shows you watch. Just like the million other Basic Bros like me.  
> 
> 我认为自己是一个 "Basic Bro"--我有PS4和Nintendo Switch，我喜欢Marvel电影，看和你一样的Netflix节目。就像其他一百万个像我一样的基本兄弟一样。
> 
> Totally basic. Totally boring. NOT a personal brand.
> 
>   
> 
> 完全是基本的。完全无聊。不是一个个人品牌。

And this is very useful to know.  

而这一点是非常有用的，要知道。

## Personal Brands Exist Because We’re All Broadcasters Now  

个人品牌的存在是因为我们现在都是广播员了

Leonard Lauder — uniquely amongst his generation — had to grapple with the implications of personal brand because his mother created a consumer-facing luxury company.  

伦纳德-兰黛--在他那一代人中是独一无二的--不得不努力应对个人品牌的影响，因为他的母亲创建了一家面向消费者的奢侈品公司。  

Reading his autobiography is in many ways a history of brand strategy: Lauder was born in 1933, and — unlike the marketers that came after him — had to figure out how branding worked for himself, from scratch.  

阅读他的自传在很多方面都是一部品牌战略的历史：劳德出生于1933年，与他之后的营销人员不同，他必须从头开始为自己摸索品牌的运作方式。  

In other words, he made it up as he went along.  

换句话说，他是边走边编的。

Personal brands are more of a thing now because everyone is a broadcaster.  

个人品牌现在更多的是一种东西，因为每个人都是一个广播员。  

Nobody but the Lauders — and a few others: politicians and media celebrities amongst them — had to worry about personal brand building in the decades after World War 2. But those who want to develop an online presence today have to grapple with some of the issues that Lauder faced in the 60s, and that, later, rock stars faced after the creation of MTV.  

在二战后的几十年里，除了劳德夫妇--还有其他一些人：其中包括政治家和媒体名人--没有人需要担心个人品牌建设。但是，今天那些想要发展网络形象的人必须努力解决劳德在60年代面临的一些问题，以及后来摇滚明星在MTV诞生后面临的问题。

For the rest of this essay, when I say ‘personal brand’, I mean ‘the projection that you create of yourself in the heads of an audience, through a one-to-many broadcast channel’.  

在这篇文章的其余部分，当我说 "个人品牌 "时，我的意思是 "你通过一对多的广播渠道，在听众的头脑中创造的自我投射"。  

There are many definitions of personal brand, but this one is mine.  

个人品牌的定义有很多，但这个定义是我的。

## Reputations and Personal Brands Aren’t The Same Thing  

声誉和个人品牌不是一回事

One of the most interesting tensions in this topic is the gap between reputation and personal brand.  

这个话题中最有趣的张力之一是声誉和个人品牌之间的差距。

I think it’s fairly obvious that while there is large degree of overlap between the two concepts, they aren’t _exactly_ the same thing. Warren Buffett’s dictum of “We can afford to lose money — even a lot of money.  

我认为相当明显的是，虽然这两个概念之间有很大程度的重叠，但它们并不完全是一回事。沃伦-巴菲特的箴言："我们可以承受亏损--甚至是大量的亏损。  

But we can’t afford to lose reputation — even a shred of reputation” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it, if you swapped out ‘reputation’ for ‘personal brand’.  

但我们不能失去声誉--哪怕是一丝丝的声誉"，如果你把 "声誉 "换成 "个人品牌"，就不太合适了。

The best frame I currently have for thinking about this is that reputation is what other people say about you, while personal brand is what you project about yourself.  

我目前思考这个问题的最佳框架是，声誉是别人对你的评价，而个人品牌是你对自己的投射。  

Ideally, the two are the same. But sometimes, they drift apart.  

理想情况下，这两者是一样的。但有时，它们会渐行渐远。

Here’s an example: I recently discovered that a thought leader I followed on Twitter was somewhat of a dickwad in real life.  

这里有一个例子：我最近发现，我在Twitter上关注的一位思想领袖在现实生活中有点像个傻子。  

This was surprising — especially given that said person operated in Silicon Valley, while I lived in Singapore, half a globe away.  

这很令人惊讶--特别是考虑到这个人在硅谷工作，而我住在半个地球以外的新加坡。  

You would think that reputations stay fairly local; on social media, this person always seemed thoughtful and kind and interesting and insightful.  

你会认为声誉保持在相当大的范围内；在社交媒体上，这个人总是显得周到、善良、有趣和有洞察力。  

But through a friend who had operated in the Valley, I learnt that they weren't all they were made up to be.  

但是，通过一位在山谷做手术的朋友，我了解到他们并不像他们所想象的那样。

I think we know this instinctively: people can project themselves as kind or thoughtful or smart on a medium that they control.  

我想我们本能地知道这一点：人们可以在他们控制的媒体上把自己投射为善良、体贴或聪明的人。  

But because careers last four decades on average, and because the number of people you interact with only increases with time, reputations tend to win out.  

但是，由于职业生涯平均持续40年，而且你所交往的人的数量只会随着时间的推移而增加，因此声誉往往会胜出。

## Must You Build a Personal Brand?  

你必须建立一个个人品牌吗？

No, of course not. It really depends on what you’re trying to do. I know people with [career moats](https://commoncog.com/career-moats-101/) so solid that they can quit their jobs tomorrow and secure an offer with a new company in a week; these people don’t bother with social media. And why should they?  

不，当然不是。这真的取决于你想做什么。我认识一些人，他们的职业护城河非常稳固，明天就可以辞掉工作，一周内就能获得新公司的聘用；这些人不屑于使用社交媒体。他们为什么要这样做呢？  

If you operate in an industry with a dense reputation network, then you can probably rely on that network for new opportunities, broadcast mediums be damned.  

如果你经营的行业有密集的声誉网络，那么你可能可以依靠这个网络来获得新的机会，广播媒体就不用管了。

One of the first rules of marketing is that you have to know who you’re selling to, so that you don’t spend resources on channels that aren’t as good.  

营销的首要规则之一是，你必须知道你的销售对象是谁，这样你就不会把资源花在那些不那么好的渠道上。  

Sometimes, this isn’t so clear.  

有时，这并不那么清楚。  

“What if we sponsor a golf tournament?” someone suggests at your weekly marketing meeting, and the answer to that question isn’t necessarily “golf tournaments don’t work!” — they might, for some products!  

"如果我们赞助一个高尔夫锦标赛怎么样？"有人在你的每周营销会议上建议，这个问题的答案不一定是 "高尔夫锦标赛不起作用！"- 对于某些产品来说，它们可能是有效的！  

— but instead “historically, the people who buy our boring enterprise software are CTOs, and those nerds don’t hang out at golf tournaments.”  

\- 而是 "从历史上看，购买我们无聊的企业软件的人是首席技术官，而那些书呆子不会在高尔夫锦标赛上闲逛。"

(I stole this example from April Dunford, because she uses it to make this exact point: when you are in an early-stage company, how do you know if one marketing tactic is better than another, _before_ you try it out? How do you win in internal marketing fights? And the [answer she gives](https://youtu.be/FgwJbE1wIzk?t=627) is simple: _start from the customer — who are you trying to target, really? How do they view solutions like yours? And how do they buy stuff?_ Once you have these answers, everything unfolds naturally: you can ask where they hang out; you can investigate the publications that they read.  

(我从April Dunford那里偷了这个例子，因为她用它来说明这个确切的观点：当你在一个早期阶段的公司，在你尝试之前，你怎么知道一种营销策略是否比另一种更好？你如何在内部营销斗争中获胜？而她给出的答案很简单：从客户入手--你到底想针对谁？他们如何看待像你这样的解决方案？他们又是如何买东西的？一旦你有了这些答案，一切都会自然而然地展开：你可以问他们在哪里闲逛；你可以调查他们阅读的出版物。  

Marketing debates simply become easier.)  

营销辩论只是变得更容易)。

In a career context, a personal brand exists to secure career opportunities.  

在职业方面，个人品牌的存在是为了确保职业机会。  

And so you have to ask yourself: are the people who might offer those opportunities on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn?  

因此，你必须问自己：那些可能提供这些机会的人是在Twitter或Facebook或LinkedIn上吗？  

For certain careers, that answer is yes; for others, that answer is no.  

对于某些职业来说，这个答案是肯定的；对于其他职业来说，这个答案是否定的。  

If you attempt to build a personal brand in ML research, for instance, you would very quickly learn that — say, pre-tenure — publication in conferences are the most important thing, followed closely by citation count; no amount of Twitter clout would get you the positions that you desire.  

例如，如果你试图在ML研究领域建立个人品牌，你会很快了解到--比如说，在任职前--在会议上发表文章是最重要的，紧随其后的是引文数量；再多的Twitter影响力也无法让你获得你想要的职位。

I’ve mentioned that my career moat is my ability to set up and operate engineering offices in uncomfortable South East Asian countries.  

我已经提到，我的职业护城河是我在不舒服的东南亚国家建立和运营工程办公室的能力。  

If I were to look for a job, my target audience would be the founders and operators of SEA tech businesses, particularly those who want to set up regional offices but fear the operational difficulty involved. I _could_ build a personal brand on Twitter to that effect, but I’d get far better results for far less work if I talked about these things within the region’s existing startup networks.  

如果我想找一份工作，我的目标受众将是东南亚科技企业的创始人和经营者，特别是那些想设立地区办事处但又担心操作困难的人。我可以在Twitter上建立一个个人品牌，但如果我在该地区现有的创业公司网络中谈论这些事情，我会得到更好的结果，而且工作量要小得多。  

(I could also write an article on [Tech In Asia](https://www.techinasia.com/), since a good number of founder-operators and their VCs read TIA; my point here is simply that I’m starting with my target ‘customer’ in mind, and writing or speaking where they already hang out).  

(我也可以在Tech In Asia上写一篇文章，因为有很多创始人-经营者和他们的风险投资人都会阅读TIA；我在这里的观点只是，我从我的目标 "客户 "出发，在他们已经聚集的地方写作或演讲）。

You can perhaps see why a personal brand isn’t as important for my context.  

你也许可以看到为什么个人品牌对我的背景来说并不那么重要。  

What’s more important is my reputation: if a founder wanted to hire me, they’d likely start asking around — and what my references say about me as an operator are way more important than what I broadcast on LinkedIn.  

更重要的是我的声誉：如果一个创始人想雇用我，他们很可能会开始打听--我的推荐人对我这个经营者的评价比我在LinkedIn上的广播要重要得多。

Don’t get me wrong, though: personal brands _are_ powerful things.  

不过，不要误会我的意思：个人品牌是强大的东西。  

Leonard Lauder didn’t turn Estée Lauder into a brand for no reason; together, mother and son built the company into the diversified beauty conglomerate that it is today.  

伦纳德-兰黛把雅诗兰黛变成一个品牌不是没有原因的；母子俩一起把公司建成了今天这样一个多元化的美容集团。  

Similarly, personal brands can do wonders if they fit into the opportunity sets that you’re seeking.  

同样地，如果个人品牌符合你所寻求的机会组合，也能创造奇迹。  

My point is simply to be explicit about this decision: to know why you’re building a personal brand in the first place.  

我的观点只是要明确这个决定：首先要知道你为什么要建立一个个人品牌。

## Closing Thoughts 闭幕感想

One thing that I’m not so sure about is if personal branding will become a permanent thing — an evolution of the career [metagame](https://commoncog.com/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/), if you will. In 1991, Warren Buffett [famously warned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u7-UNSkr4o) Salomon’s employees about protecting the reputation of their firm. He said: “Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding.  

我不太确定的一点是，个人品牌是否会成为一个永久性的东西--如果你愿意的话，是职业元游戏的演变。1991年，沃伦-巴菲特(Warren Buffett)曾警告所罗门公司的员工要保护他们公司的声誉，这很有名。他说："为公司输钱，我就会理解。  

Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”  

如果失去公司的一丝声誉，我将无情地对待。"

It's clear that reputation is a timeless thing.  

很明显，声誉是一个永恒的东西。  

But would we also teach our kids to curate a powerful personal brand, the same way savvy Gen-Zers parlay fame on TikTok and YouTube into fortune elsewhere?  

但是，我们会不会也教我们的孩子策划一个强大的个人品牌，就像精明的Z世代在TikTok和YouTube上的名声变成其他地方的财富一样？

I’m not so sure about this. Then again, I’m probably too old for TikTok.  

我不太确定这一点。话说回来，我可能对TikTok来说太老了。  

I’ve been digging into brand building and brand history out of curiosity — what did it feel like, creating the brand playbooks that we take for granted today?  

出于好奇，我一直在挖掘品牌建设和品牌历史--创造我们今天认为理所当然的品牌游戏书，那是一种什么感觉？  

How much of that experience informs our current moment?  

那段经历有多少影响了我们现在的时刻？

From what I’ve read, I can say only the following with confidence: it is the rare person indeed who can keep a personal brand relevant for longer than a decade.  

从我所读到的内容来看，我只能自信地说：能够将个人品牌保持在十年以上的人确实很罕见。  

There aren’t many Estées and Madonnas around, after all.  

毕竟，周围没有多少埃斯特和马多纳。  

And I think it is easy to grok why: personal brand building takes continued effort, whereas reputation is simply the result of our actions over a long period of time.  

我认为这很容易理解：个人品牌的建立需要持续的努力，而声誉只是我们在很长一段时间内行动的结果。

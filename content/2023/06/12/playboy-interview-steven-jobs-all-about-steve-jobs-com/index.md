#### Interview 采访

___

We survived 1984, and computers did not take over the world, though some people might find that hard to believe.  

我们熬过了1984年，计算机并没有接管世界，尽管有些人可能觉得这很难相信。  

If there’s any one individual who can be either blamed or praised for the proliferation of computers, you, the 29-year-old father of the computer revolution, are the prime contender.  

如果有任何一个人可以因为计算机的普及而受到指责或赞扬，你，这位29岁的计算机革命之父，是首要的竞争者。  

It has also made you wealthy beyond dreams—your stock was worth almost a half billion dollars at one point, wasn’t it?  

它也使你的财富超出了梦想--你的股票一度价值近5亿美元，不是吗？

I actually lost $250,000,000 in one year when the stock went down. \[Laughs\]  

实际上，当股票下跌时，我在一年内损失了250,000,000美元。\[笑\]

You can laugh about it?  

你能嘲笑它吗？

I’m not going to let it ruin my life. Isn’t it kind of funny?  

我不打算让它毁掉我的生活。这不是有点好笑吗？  

You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it’s humorous, all the attention to it, because it’s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me in the past ten years.  

你知道，我对钱这件事的主要反应是，所有对它的关注都很幽默，因为它几乎不是过去十年里发生在我身上的最有见地或最有价值的事情。  

But it makes me feel old, sometimes, when I speak at a campus and I find that what students are most in awe of is the fact that I’m a millionaire.  

但这让我觉得自己老了，有时，当我在校园里演讲时，我发现学生们最敬畏的是我是个百万富翁。  

When I went to school, it was right after the Sixties and before this general wave of practical purposefulness had set in.  

我上学的时候，正好是在六十年代之后，在这个普遍的实用目的性浪潮来临之前。  

Now students aren’t even thinking in idealistic terms, or at least nowhere near as much.  

现在，学生们甚至不在用理想主义的方式思考问题，或者至少远远没有那么多。  

They certainly are not letting any of the philosophical issues of the day take up too much of their time as they study their business majors.  

他们在学习商业专业时，当然不会让当时的任何哲学问题占去他们太多的时间。  

The idealistic wind of the Sixties was still at our backs, though, and most of the people I know who are my age have that ingrained in them forever.  

不过，六十年代的理想主义之风仍然在我们的背后，我认识的大多数与我同龄的人都把这种思想永远地根植于他们心中。

It’s interesting that the computer field has made millionaires of——  

有趣的是，计算机领域已经造就了百万富翁------。

Young maniacs, I know.  

年轻的狂人，我知道。

We were going to say guys like you and Steve Wozniak, working out of a garage only ten years ago. Just what is this revolution you two seem to have started?  

我们本来想说像你和史蒂夫-沃兹尼亚克这样的人，十年前才在一个车库里工作。只是，你们两个似乎已经开始的这场革命是什么？

We’re living in the wake of the petrochemical revolution of 100 years ago. The petrochemical revolution gave us free energy—free mechanical energy, in this case.  

我们生活在100年前的石油化工革命之后。石化革命给了我们免费的能源--在这种情况下，是免费的机械能源。  

It changed the texture of society in most ways. This revolution, the information revolution, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy.  

它在大多数方面改变了社会的结构。这场革命，即信息革命，也是一场自由能源的革命，但却是另一种：自由知识能源。  

It’s very crude today, yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt light bulb to run and it can save you hours a day.  

今天，它非常简陋，然而我们的Macintosh电脑运行时的耗电量比一个100瓦的灯泡还要少，它可以为你每天节省几个小时。  

What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now? This revolution will dwarf the petrochemical revolution. We’re on the forefront.  

十年或二十年后，或五十年后，它能做什么？这场革命将使石油化工革命相形见绌。我们站在了最前沿。

Maybe we should pause and get your definition of what a computer is. How do they work?  

也许我们应该暂停一下，听听你对什么是计算机的定义。它们是如何工作的？

Computers are actually pretty simple. We’re sitting here on a bench in this cafe \[for this part of the Interview\].  

计算机实际上是很简单的。我们坐在这间咖啡馆的长椅上\[进行这部分的采访\]。  

Let’s assume that you understood only the most rudimentary of directions and you asked how to find the rest room.  

假设你只明白最基本的方向，你问如何找到休息室。  

I would have to describe it to you in very specific and precise instructions. I might say, “Scoot sideways two meters off the bench. Stand erect. Lift left foot.  

我将不得不以非常具体和精确的指令向你描述它。我可能会说，"从凳子上往旁边挪动两米。直立。抬起左脚。  

Bend left knee until it is horizontal. Extend left foot and shift weight 300 centimeters forward …” and on and on.  

弯曲左膝，直到它处于水平状态。伸出左脚，将重心前移300厘米......"，不断重复。  

If you could interpret all those instructions 100 times faster than any other person in this cafe, you would appear to be a magician: You could run over and grab a milk shake and bring it back and set it on the table and snap your fingers, and I’d think you made the milk shake appear, because it was so fast relative to my perception.  

如果你能比这个咖啡馆里的任何其他人快100倍地解释所有这些指令，你就会显得像个魔术师：你可以跑过去，拿起一杯奶昔，拿回来放在桌子上，然后打一个响指，我会认为是你让奶昔出现的，因为相对于我的感知来说，它是如此之快。  

That’s exactly what a computer does.  

这正是计算机的作用。  

It takes these very, very simple-minded instructions—”Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number”—but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second.  

它需要这些非常、非常简单的指令--"去取一个数字，与这个数字相加，把结果放在那里，察看它是否大于这个其他的数字"--但执行它们的速度，比方说，每秒100万次。  

At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.  

在每秒1,000,000次的情况下，结果似乎很神奇。  

That’s a simple explanation, and the point is that people really don’t have to understand how computers work.  

这是一个简单的解释，关键是人们真的不需要了解计算机的工作原理。  

Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car.  

大多数人对自动变速器的工作原理没有概念，但他们知道如何驾驶汽车。  

You don’t have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car.  

你不需要学习物理学，了解运动规律来驾驶汽车。  

You don’t have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh—but you asked \[laughs\].  

你不需要了解这些东西就可以使用Macintosh--但你问了\[笑\]。

Obviously, you believe that computers are going to change our personal lives, but how would you persuade a skeptic? A holdout?  

显然，你相信计算机将改变我们的个人生活，但你将如何说服一个怀疑论者？一个持反对意见的人？

A computer is the most incredible tool we’ve ever seen.  

计算机是我们所见过的最不可思议的工具。  

It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a supercalculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from.  

它可以是一个写作工具，一个通信中心，一个超级计算器，一个规划器，一个归档器和一个艺术工具，只要给它新的指令或软件，它就可以成为一个整体。  

There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer. We have no idea how far it’s going to go. Right now, computers make our lives easier.  

没有其他工具能有计算机的力量和多功能性。我们不知道它将会走多远。现在，计算机使我们的生活更容易。  

They do work for us in fractions of a second that would take us hours.  

他们在几分之一秒的时间内为我们做了我们要花几个小时的工作。  

They increase the quality of life, some of that by simply automating drudgery and some of that by broadening our possibilities.  

它们提高了生活质量，其中一些是通过简单的自动化苦差事，一些是通过扩大我们的可能性。  

As things progress, they’ll be doing more and more for us.  

随着事情的进展，他们将为我们做越来越多的事情。

How about some concrete reasons to buy a computer today? An executive in your industry recently said, “We’ve given people computers, but we haven’t shown them what to do with them.  

今天买电脑的一些具体理由如何？你所在行业的一位高管最近说："我们已经给人们提供了电脑，但我们还没有告诉他们如何使用它们。  

I can balance my checkbook faster by hand than on my computer.” Why should a person buy a computer?  

我用手来平衡我的支票簿比用电脑更快。"一个人为什么要买一台电脑？

There are different answers for different people.  

对于不同的人有不同的答案。  

In business, that question is easy to answer: You really can prepare documents much faster and at a higher quality level, and you can do many things to increase office productivity.  

在商业领域，这个问题很容易回答：你确实可以更快、更高质量地准备文件，你可以做很多事情来提高办公效率。

A computer frees people from much of the menial work. Besides that, you are giving them a tool that encourages them to be creative. Remember, computers are tools.

  

一台电脑将人们从许多琐碎的工作中解放出来。除此之外，你给他们一个工具，鼓励他们发挥创造力。记住，计算机是工具。  

Tools help us do our work better. In education, computers are the first thing to come along since books that will sit there and interact with you endlessly, without judgment.  

工具帮助我们更好地完成工作。在教育领域，计算机是自书本以来第一个出现的东西，它将坐在那里与你进行无休止的互动，没有任何判断。  

Socratic education isn’t available anymore, and computers have the potential to be a real breakthrough in the educational process when used in conjunction with enlightened teachers.  

苏格拉底式教育已经不存在了，如果与开明的教师一起使用，计算机有可能成为教育过程中的真正突破口。

We’re in most schools already.

  

我们已经在大多数学校里了。

Those are arguments for computers in business and in schools, but what about the home?  

这些都是计算机在商业和学校中的论据，但在家庭中呢？

So far, that’s more of a conceptual market than a real market.  

到目前为止，这更像是一个概念性的市场，而不是一个真正的市场。  

The primary reasons to buy a computer for your home now are that you want to do some business work at home or you want to run educational software for yourself or your children.  

现在给家里买电脑的主要原因是，你想在家里做一些商业工作，或者你想为自己或孩子运行教育软件。  

If you can’t justify buying a computer for one of those two reasons, the only other possible reason is that you just want to be computer literate.  

如果你不能为这两个原因之一而购买电脑，那么唯一可能的原因就是你只是想了解电脑知识。  

You know there’s something going on, you don’t exactly know what it is, so you want to learn. This will change: Computers will be essential in most homes.  

你知道有事情发生，但你并不确切知道它是什么，所以你想学习。这将会改变：计算机将成为大多数家庭的必需品。

What will change? 什么会改变？

The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it into a nationwide communications network.  

对大多数人来说，为家庭购买电脑的最令人信服的理由是将其连接到一个全国性的通信网络。  

We’re just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people—as remarkable as the telephone.  

对大多数人来说，我们只是处于一个真正了不起的突破的开始阶段，就像电话一样了不起。

Specifically, what kind of breakthrough are you talking about?  

具体来说，你说的是什么样的突破？

I can only begin to speculate. We see that a lot in our industry: You don’t know exactly what’s going to result, but you know it’s something very big and very good.  

我只能开始猜测。我们在我们的行业中经常看到这种情况：你不知道到底会有什么结果，但你知道它是非常大、非常好的事情。

Then for now, aren’t you asking home-computer buyers to invest $3000 in what is essentially an act of faith?  

那么现在，你不是要求家用电脑买家在本质上是一种信仰行为上投资3000美元吗？

In the future, it won’t be an act of faith. The hard part of what we’re up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can’t tell them.  

在未来，这不会是一种信仰的行为。我们现在面临的困难是，人们问你具体的情况，你不能告诉他们。  

A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked Alexander Graham Bell, “What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?” he wouldn’t have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world.  

一百年前，如果有人问亚历山大-格雷厄姆-贝尔，"你将能用电话做什么？"他不会告诉他电话将以何种方式影响世界。  

He didn’t know that people would use the telephone to call up and find out what movies were playing that night or to order some groceries or call a relative on the other side of the globe.  

他不知道人们会用电话来了解当晚播放的电影，或订购一些食品，或给地球另一端的亲戚打电话。  

But remember that first the public telegraph was inaugurated, in 1844. It was an amazing breakthrough in communications.  

但请记住，公共电报是在1844年首次启用的。这是通信领域的一个惊人的突破。  

You could actually send messages from New York to San Francisco in an afternoon.  

你实际上可以在一个下午从纽约向旧金山发送信息。  

People talked about putting a telegraph on every desk in America to improve productivity. But it wouldn’t have worked.  

人们谈论过在美国的每张桌子上放一台电报机以提高生产力。但这并不奏效。  

It required that people learn this whole sequence of strange incantations, Morse code, dots and dashes, to use the telegraph. It took about 40 hours to learn.  

它要求人们学习这一连串奇怪的咒语、摩斯密码、点和破折号，以使用电报。这需要花费大约40个小时来学习。  

The majority of people would never learn how to use it.  

大多数人都不会学会如何使用它。  

So, fortunately, in the 1870s, Bell filed the patents for the telephone. It performed basically the same function as the telegraph, but people already knew how to use it.  

因此，幸运的是，在19世纪70年代，贝尔申请了电话的专利。它的功能基本上与电报相同，但人们已经知道如何使用它。  

Also, the neatest thing about it was that besides allowing you to communicate with just words, it allowed you to sing.  

另外，最巧妙的是，除了允许你用语言交流外，它还允许你唱歌。

Meaning what? 意味着什么？

It allowed you to intone your words with meaning beyond the simple linguistics. And we’re in the same situation today.  

它使你的话语具有超越简单语言学的意义。而我们今天也处于同样的情况。  

Some people are saying that we ought to put an IBM PC on every desk in America to improve productivity. It won’t work.  

有些人说，我们应该在美国的每张桌子上放一台IBM PC，以提高生产力。这是不可能的。  

The special incantations you have to learn this time are “slash q-zs” and things like that. The manual for WordStar, the most popular word-processing program, is 400 pages thick.  

这次你要学习的特殊咒语是 "斜线q-z "之类的东西。最受欢迎的文字处理程序WordStar的手册有400页厚。  

To write a novel, you have to read a novel—one that reads like a mystery to most people. They’re not going to learn slash q-z any more than they’re going to learn Morse code.  

要写一部小说，你必须先读一部小说--对大多数人来说读起来像一个谜。他们不会像学习摩尔斯电码那样去学习斜线q-z。  

That is what Macintosh is all about. It’s the first “telephone” of our industry.  

这就是Macintosh的全部内容。它是我们行业的第一个 "电话"。  

And, besides that, the neatest thing about it, to me, is that the Macintosh lets you sing the way the telephone did.  

而且，除此之外，对我来说，最整洁的事情是Macintosh让你像电话那样唱歌。  

You don’t simply communicate words, you have special print styles and the ability to draw and add pictures to express yourself.  

你不只是简单地交流文字，你有特殊的印刷风格，有能力绘制和添加图片来表达自己。

Is that really significant or is it simply a novelty? The Macintosh has been called “the world’s most expensive Etch A Sketch” by at least one critic.  

这真的有意义吗，还是仅仅是一种新奇？至少有一位评论家称Macintosh是 "世界上最昂贵的Etch A Sketch"。

It’s as significant as the difference between the telephone and the telegraph.  

这就像电话和电报之间的区别一样重要。  

Imagine what you could have done if you had this sophisticated an Etch A Sketch when you were growing up. But that’s only a small part of it.  

想象一下，如果你在成长过程中拥有这个精致的Etch A Sketch，你可以做什么。但这只是其中的一小部分。  

Not only can it help you increase your productivity and your creativity enormously, but it also allows us to communicate more efficiently by using pictures and graphs as well as words and numbers.  

它不仅可以帮助你极大地提高你的生产力和创造力，而且还可以让我们通过使用图片和图表以及文字和数字来更有效地沟通。

Most computers use key strokes to enter instructions, but Macintosh replaces many of them with something called a mouse—a little box that is rolled around on your desk and guides a pointer on your computer screen.  

大多数计算机使用按键来输入指令，但Macintosh用一种叫做鼠标的东西取代了许多按键--一个在桌子上滚动的小盒子，在计算机屏幕上引导一个指针。  

It’s a big change for people used to keyboards. Why the mouse?  

对于习惯于键盘的人来说，这是一个很大的变化。为什么要用鼠标？

If I want to tell you there is a spot on your shirt, I’m not going to do it linguistically: “There’s a spot on your shirt 14 centimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the left of your button.” If you have a spot—”There!” \[He points\]—I’ll point to it.  

如果我想告诉你，你的衬衫上有一个斑点，我不会用语言来做："你的衬衫上有一个斑点，从领口往下14厘米，在你的纽扣左边3厘米处。"如果你有一个斑点--"那里！"\[他指着\]--我会指着它。  

Pointing is a metaphor we all know.  

指向是一个我们都知道的比喻。  

We’ve done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it’s much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it’s not only easier to use but more efficient.  

我们在这方面做了很多研究和测试，用鼠标做各种功能，如剪切和粘贴，要快得多，所以它不仅容易使用，而且效率更高。

How long did it take to develop Macintosh?  

开发Macintosh需要多长时间？

It was more than two years on the computer itself. We had been working on the technology behind it for years before that.  

在计算机本身上花了两年多的时间。在此之前，我们已经在其背后的技术上工作了多年。  

I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that.  

我不认为我曾经如此努力地工作过，但在Macintosh上工作是我生命中最整洁的经历。几乎所有在上面工作过的人都会这么说。  

None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn’t be ours anymore.  

我们没有人想在最后释放它。仿佛我们知道，一旦它离开我们的手，它就不再是我们的了。  

When we finally presented it at the shareholders’ meeting, everyone in the auditorium stood up and gave it a five-minute ovation.  

当我们最终在股东大会上提出时，礼堂里的每个人都站起来，为它鼓掌5分钟。  

What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows. It was as though none of us could believe that we’d actually finished it.  

让我感到不可思议的是，我可以看到前几排的麦克团队。仿佛我们都不相信我们真的完成了比赛。  

Everyone started crying. 每个人都开始哭泣。

We were warned about you: Before this Interview began, someone said we were “about to be snowed by the best.”  

我们被警告过你：在这次采访开始之前，有人说我们 "即将被最好的人雪藏"。

\[Smiling\] We’re just enthusiastic about what we do.  

\[微笑\]我们只是对我们的工作充满热情。

But considering that enthusiasm, the multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and your own ability to get press coverage, how does the consumer know what’s behind the hype?  

但考虑到这种热情、数百万美元的广告宣传以及你自己获得新闻报道的能力，消费者如何知道炒作背后的东西？

Ad campaigns are necessary for competition; IBM’s ads are everywhere. But good PR educates people; that’s all it is. You can’t con people in this business.  

广告活动对于竞争是必要的；IBM的广告无处不在。但好的公共关系是教育人们；这就是它的全部。在这个行业中，你不能欺骗人们。  

The products speak for themselves.  

产品不言自明。

Aside from some of the recurrent criticisms—that the mouse is inefficient, that the Macintosh screen is only black and white—the most serious charge is that Apple overprices its products.  

除了一些经常性的批评--鼠标效率低下，Macintosh屏幕只有黑色和白色--最严重的指控是苹果公司对其产品定价过高。  

Do you care to answer any or all?  

你是否愿意回答任何或所有问题？

We’ve done studies that prove that the mouse is faster than traditional ways of moving through data or applications.  

我们已经做过研究，证明鼠标比传统的数据或应用程序的移动方式要快。  

Someday we may be able to build a color screen for a reasonable price. As to overpricing, the start-up of a new product makes it more expensive than it will be later.  

有一天，我们也许能够以合理的价格制造出一个彩色屏幕。至于定价过高，一个新产品的启动使它比以后的价格要高。  

The more we can produce, the lower the price will get——  

我们能生产的越多，价格就会越低------。

That’s what critics charge you with: hooking the enthusiasts with premium prices, then turning around and lowering your prices to catch the rest of the market.  

这就是评论家指控你的地方：用高价勾引发烧友，然后转身降低价格以抓住市场的其他部分。

That’s simply untrue. As soon as we can lower prices, we do. It’s true that our computers are less expensive today than they were a few years ago, or even last year.  

这根本不是事实。只要我们能降低价格，我们就会这样做。今天我们的电脑确实比几年前，甚至是去年的价格要低。  

But that’s also true of the IBM PC. Our goal is to get computers out to tens of millions of people, and the cheaper we can make them, the easier it’s going to be to do that.  

但这也是IBM PC的真实情况。我们的目标是将计算机推广到数千万人手中，而我们能使它们越便宜，就越容易做到这一点。  

I’d love it if Macintosh cost $1000.  

如果Macintosh的价格是1000美元，我很喜欢。

How about people who bought Lisa and Apple III, the two computers you released prior to Macintosh? You’ve left them with incompatible, out-of-date products.  

那些买了Lisa和Apple III的人怎么样，这两台你们在Macintosh之前发布的电脑？你们留给他们的是不兼容的、过时的产品。

If you want to try that one, add the people who bought the IBM PCs or the PCjrs to that list, too.  

如果你想试试这一招，把购买IBM PC或PCjrs的人也加到这个名单上。  

As far as Lisa is concerned, since some of its technology was used in the Macintosh, it can now run Macintosh software and is being seen as a big brother to Macintosh; though it was unsuccessful at first, our sales of Lisa are going through the roof.  

就Lisa而言，由于它的一些技术被用于Macintosh，它现在可以运行Macintosh的软件，并被视为Macintosh的大哥；虽然一开始不成功，但我们的Lisa的销售却在不断上升。  

We’re also still selling more than 2000 Apple IIIs a month—more than half to repeat buyers.  

我们每个月还在销售2000多部苹果III，其中一半以上是重复购买者。  

The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it.  

总的来说，新技术不一定会取代旧技术，但会使其过时。根据定义。最终，它将取代它。  

But it’s like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.  

但这就像彩色电视出现时拥有黑白电视的人一样。他们最终决定新技术是否值得投资。

At the rate things are changing, won’t Mac itself be out of date within a few years?  

按照事情变化的速度，Mac本身不会在几年内就过时了吗？

Before Macintosh, there were two standards: Apple II and IBM PC. Those two standards are like rivers carved in the rock bed of a canyon.  

在Macintosh之前，有两个标准：苹果II和IBM PC。这两种标准就像在峡谷的岩床上雕刻的河流。  

It’s taken years to carve them—seven years to carve the Apple II and four years to carve the IBM.  

雕刻它们花了很多年--雕刻Apple II花了七年，雕刻IBM花了四年。  

What we have done with Macintosh is that in less than a year, through the momentum of the revolutionary aspects of the product and through every ounce of marketing that we have as a company, we have been able to blast a third channel through that rock and make a third river, a third standard.  

我们在Macintosh上所做的是，在不到一年的时间里，通过产品的革命性方面的势头，以及通过我们作为一个公司所拥有的每一盎司的营销，我们已经能够在那块岩石上炸开第三条渠道，使之成为第三条河流，第三种标准。  

In my opinion, there are only two companies that can do that today, Apple and IBM.  

在我看来，今天只有两家公司能做到这一点，即苹果和IBM。  

Maybe that’s too bad, but to do it right now is just a monumental effort, and I don’t think that Apple or IBM will do that in the next three or four years.  

也许这太糟糕了，但现在要做的只是一个不朽的努力，我不认为苹果或IBM会在未来三、四年内做到这一点。  

Toward the end of the Eighties, we may be seeing some new things.  

在八十年代末，我们可能会看到一些新的东西。

And in the meantime?  

在这期间呢？

The developments will be in making the products more and more portable, networking them, getting out laser printers, getting out shared data bases, getting out more communications ability, maybe the merging of the telephone and the personal computer.  

发展将是使产品越来越便携，将它们联网，推出激光打印机，推出共享数据库，推出更多的通信能力，也许是电话和个人电脑的合并。

You have a lot riding on this one. Some people have said that Macintosh will make or break Apple.  

你在这个问题上有很大的把握。有些人说，Macintosh将成就或破坏苹果。  

After Lisa and Apple III, Apple stock plummeted and the industry speculated that Apple might not survive.  

在丽莎和苹果三代之后，苹果股价暴跌，业界猜测苹果可能无法生存。

Yeah, we felt the weight of the world on our shoulders.  

是的，我们感到世界的重量在我们肩上。  

We knew that we had to pull the rabbit out of the hat with Macintosh, or else we’d never realize the dreams we had for either the products or the company.  

我们知道，我们必须从Macintosh的帽子里拿出兔子，否则我们将永远无法实现我们对产品和公司的梦想。

How serious was it? Was Apple near bankruptcy?  

情况有多严重？苹果是否接近破产？

No, no, no. In fact, 1983, when all these predictions were being made, was a phenomenally successful year for Apple. We virtually doubled in size in 1983. We went from $583,000,000 in 1982 to something like $980,000,000 in sales.  

不，不，不。事实上，1983年，当所有这些预测都被提出时，对苹果来说是惊人的成功。我们的规模在1983年几乎翻了一番。我们从1982年的5.83亿美元增加到大约9.8亿美元的销售额。  

It was almost all Apple II-related. It just didn’t live up to our expectations.  

这几乎都是与苹果II有关的。它只是没有达到我们的期望。  

If Macintosh weren’t a success, we probably would have stayed at something like a billion dollars a year, selling Apple IIs and versions of it.  

如果Macintosh不成功，我们可能会停留在每年10亿美元左右，销售Apple II和它的版本。

Then what was behind the talk last year that Apple had had it?  

那么，去年关于苹果公司已经拥有它的言论背后是什么呢？

IBM was coming on very, very strong, and the momentum was switching to IBM. The software developers were moving to IBM. The dealers were talking more and more of IBM.  

IBM当时非常、非常强大，而且势头正转向IBM。软件开发人员正在向IBM转移。经销商们越来越多地谈论IBM。  

It became clear to all of us who worked on Macintosh that it was just gonna blow the socks off the industry, that it was going to redefine the industry.  

我们所有在Macintosh上工作的人都清楚，它将使整个行业大吃一惊，它将重新定义这个行业。  

And that’s exactly what it had to do.  

而这正是它必须做的事情。  

If Macintosh hadn’t been successful, then I should have just thrown in the towel, because my vision of the whole industry would have been totally wrong.  

如果Macintosh没有获得成功，那么我应该直接扔掉毛巾，因为我对整个行业的看法将是完全错误的。

Apple III was supposed to have been your souped-up Apple II, but it has been a failure since it was launched, four years ago.  

苹果III本应是你的强化版苹果II，但它自四年前推出以来一直是个失败品。  

You recalled the first 14,000, and even the revised Apple III never took off. How much was lost on Apple III?  

你召回了第一批14000个，甚至修订后的苹果III也没有起飞。苹果III的损失有多大？

Infinite, incalculable amounts. I think if the III had been more successful, IBM would have had a much harder time entering the market place. But that’s life.  

无限的、不可估量的数量。我认为，如果三代机更加成功，IBM进入市场的难度就会更大。但这就是生活。  

I think we emerged from that experience much stronger.  

我认为我们从那次经历中变得更加强大。

Yet when Lisa came out, it, too, was a relative failure in the market place. What went wrong?  

然而，当丽莎出来时，它在市场上也是相对失败的。是什么出了问题？

First of all, it was too expensive—about ten grand. We had gotten Fortune 500-itis, trying to sell to those huge corporations, when our roots were selling to people.  

首先，它太贵了，大约1万美元。我们得了财富500强炎，试图向那些巨大的公司销售，而我们的根源是向人们销售。  

There were other problems: late shipping; the software didn’t come together in the end as well as we hoped and we lost a lot of momentum.  

还有其他问题：发货晚；软件最后没有像我们希望的那样顺利完成，我们失去了很多动力。  

And IBM’s coming on very strong, coupled with our being about six months late, coupled with the price’s being too high, plus another strategic mistake we made—deciding to sell Lisa only through about 150 dealers, which was absolutely foolish on our part—meant it was a very costly mistake.  

而IBM的强势来袭，再加上我们晚了大约六个月，再加上价格太高，再加上我们犯的另一个战略错误--决定只通过大约150个经销商销售Lisa，这对我们来说绝对是愚蠢的--意味着这是一个代价非常高的错误。  

We decided to hire people we thought were marketing and management experts.  

我们决定雇用我们认为是营销和管理专家的人。  

Not a bad idea, but unfortunately, this was such a new business that the things the so-called professionals knew were almost detriments to their success in this new way of looking at business.  

这不是一个坏主意，但不幸的是，这是一个如此新的业务，所谓的专业人士所知道的东西几乎不利于他们在这种新的业务方式中取得成功。

Was that a reflection of insecurity on your part—”This thing has gotten big and now we’re playing hardball; I better bring in some real pros”?  

这是否反映了你的不安全感--"这件事已经变大了，现在我们在打硬仗；我最好带来一些真正的专家"？

Remember, we were 23, 24 and 25 years old. We had never done any of this before, so it seemed like a good thing to do.  

请记住，我们当时23、24和25岁。我们以前从未做过这些事，所以这似乎是一件好事。

Were most of those decisions, good and bad, yours?  

这些决定，无论是好的还是坏的，大部分都是你的决定吗？

We tried never to have one person make all the decisions. There were three people running the company at that time: Mike Scott, Mike Markkula and myself.  

我们试图永远不要让一个人做出所有的决定。当时有三个人在管理公司：迈克-斯科特、迈克-马库拉和我。  

Now it’s John Sculley \[Apple's president\] and myself.  

现在是约翰-斯库利（苹果公司总裁）和我自己。  

In the early days, if there was a disagreement, I would generally defer my judgment to some of the other people who had more experience than I had. In many cases, they were right.  

在早期，如果有不同意见，我一般会把自己的判断推给其他一些比我更有经验的人。在许多情况下，他们是正确的。  

In some important cases, if we had gone my way, we would have done better.  

在一些重要的情况下，如果我们走我的路，我们会做得更好。

You wanted to run the Lisa division. Markkula and Scott, who were, in effect, your bosses, even though you had a hand in hiring them, didn’t feel you were capable, right?  

你想管理丽莎部门。马库拉和斯科特，他们实际上是你的老板，尽管你有参与雇佣他们，但他们觉得你没有能力，对吗？

After setting up the framework for the concepts and finding the key people and sort of setting the technical directions, Scotty decided I didn’t have the experience to run the thing. It hurt a lot.  

在建立了概念的框架，找到了关键人物并确定了技术方向之后，斯科特认为我没有经验来管理这件事。这让我很受伤。  

There’s no getting around it.  

这是无法回避的问题。

Did you feel you were losing Apple?  

你是否觉得你正在失去苹果？

There was a bit of that, I guess, but the thing that was harder for me was that they hired a lot of people in the Lisa group who didn’t share the vision we originally had.  

我想有一点，但对我来说更难的是，他们在丽莎集团雇佣了很多人，而这些人并不认同我们最初的愿景。  

There was a big conflict in the Lisa group between the people who wanted, in essence, to build something like Macintosh and the people hired from Hewlett-Packard and other companies who brought with them a perspective of larger machines, corporate sales.  

在Lisa小组中，有一个很大的冲突，那就是希望在本质上建立类似Macintosh的东西的人和从惠普和其他公司雇用的人之间的冲突，这些人带来了大型机器和企业销售的观点。  

I just decided that I was going to go off and do that myself with a small group, sort of go back to the garage, to design the Macintosh. They didn’t take us very seriously.  

我只是决定，我要去和一个小团体一起做这件事，有点像回到车库，去设计Macintosh。他们并没有很认真地对待我们。  

I think Scotty was just sort of humoring me.  

我认为斯科特只是在幽默我。

But this was the company that you founded. Weren’t you resentful?  

但这是你创立的公司。你不是很反感吗？

You can never resent your kid.  

你永远不能怨恨你的孩子。

Even when your kid tells you to fuck off?  

即使你的孩子叫你滚开？

I wouldn’t feel resentment. I’d feel great sorrow about it and I’d be frustrated, which I was.  

我不会感到怨恨。我会为此感到非常悲哀，我会感到沮丧，我就是这样。  

But I got the best people who were at Apple, because I thought that if we didn’t do that, we’d be in real trouble. Of course, it was those people who came up with Macintosh.  

但我找到了在苹果公司工作的最好的人，因为我认为，如果我们不这样做，我们就会有真正的麻烦。当然，正是这些人想出了Macintosh。  

\[Shrugs\] Look at Mac. \[耸肩\]看看麦克。

That verdict is far from in. In fact, you ushered in the Mac with a lot of the same fanfare that preceded the Lisa, and the Lisa failed initially.  

这个结论还远远没有出来。事实上，你在迎来Mac的时候，有很多和Lisa之前一样的大肆宣传，而Lisa最初也是失败的。

It’s true: We expressed very high hopes for Lisa and we were wrong.  

这是真的：我们对丽莎表示了很高的期望，但我们错了。  

The hardest thing for us was that we knew Macintosh was coming, and Macintosh seemed to overcome every possible objection to Lisa.  

对我们来说，最困难的事情是，我们知道Macintosh即将到来，而Macintosh似乎克服了对Lisa的每一个可能的反对。  

As a company, we would be getting back to our roots—selling computers to people, not corporations. We went off and built the most insanely great computer in the world.  

作为一家公司，我们将回到我们的本源--向人们而不是向公司销售计算机。我们去建立了世界上最疯狂的伟大的计算机。

Does it take insane people to make insanely great things?  

是否需要疯狂的人才能做出疯狂的伟大事情？

Actually, making an insanely great product has a lot to do with the process of making the product, how you learn things and adopt new ideas and throw out old ideas.  

实际上，制作一个极其伟大的产品与制作产品的过程有很大关系，你如何学习东西，采用新的想法，丢掉旧的想法。  

But, yeah, the people who made Mac are sort of on the edge.  

但是，是的，制造Mac的人有点在边缘。

What’s the difference between the people who have insanely great ideas and the people who pull off those insanely great ideas?  

有疯狂的伟大想法的人和实现这些疯狂的伟大想法的人之间有什么区别？

Let me compare it with IBM. How come the Mac group produced Mac and the people at IBM produced the PCjr?  

让我把它与IBM进行比较。为什么Mac集团生产Mac，而IBM的人生产PCjr？  

We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn’t build Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves.  

我们认为Mac会卖出数十亿，但我们不是为其他人建造Mac。我们是为自己建造的。  

We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research.  

我们是要判断它是否伟大的一群人。我们不打算出去做市场调查。  

We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.  

我们只是想建造我们能建造的最好的东西。  

When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it.  

当你是一个木匠，制作一个漂亮的抽屉柜时，你不会在背面使用一块胶合板，尽管它面向墙壁，没有人会看到它。  

You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.  

你会知道它的存在，所以你要在后面用一块漂亮的木头。  

For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.  

为了让你晚上睡得好，美学、质量必须贯穿始终。

Are you saying that the people who made the PCjr don’t have that kind of pride in the product?  

你是说制造PCjr的人对产品没有那种自豪感？

If they did, they wouldn’t have turned out the PCjr.  

如果他们这样做了，他们就不会变出PCjr。  

It seems clear to me that they were designing that on the basis of market research for a specific market segment, for a specific demographic type of customer, and they hoped that if they built this, lots of people would buy them and they’d make lots of money.  

在我看来，他们显然是在为特定的细分市场，为特定的人口类型的客户进行市场研究的基础上设计的，他们希望如果他们制造了这个，很多人会买，他们会赚很多钱。  

Those are different motivations. The people in the Mac group wanted to build the greatest computer that has ever been seen.  

这些是不同的动机。Mac组的人想建造有史以来最伟大的计算机。

Why is the computer field dominated by people so young? The average age of Apple employees is 29.  

为什么计算机领域由如此年轻的人主导？苹果公司员工的平均年龄是29岁。

It’s often the same with any new, revolutionary thing. People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers.  

任何新的、革命性的东西往往都是这样。随着年龄的增长，人们会被卡住。我们的头脑有点像电化学计算机。  

Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns.  

你的思想像脚手架一样在你的头脑中构建模式。你真的在刻画化学模式。  

In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them.  

在大多数情况下，人们被困在这些模式中，就像唱片中的凹槽一样，他们永远无法摆脱这些模式。  

It’s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things.  

这是一个罕见的人，他刻下的沟壑不是看待事物的特定方式，不是质疑事物的特定方式。  

It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing.  

你很少看到一个30多岁或40多岁的艺术家能够真正贡献出惊人的东西。  

Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re rare.  

当然，也有一些人天生好奇，在对生命的敬畏中永远是小孩子，但他们很罕见。

A lot of guys in their 40s are going to be real pleased with you. Let’s move on to the other thing that people talk about when they mention Apple—the company, not the computer.  

很多40多岁的人都会对你非常满意。让我们继续谈一谈人们提到苹果时谈论的另一件事--公司，而不是电脑。  

You feel a similar sense of mission about the way things are run at Apple, don’t you?  

你对苹果公司的运作方式有类似的使命感，对吗？

I do feel there is another way we have an effect on society besides our computers.  

我确实觉得除了我们的电脑，我们还有另一种方式对社会产生影响。  

I think Apple has a chance to be the model of a Fortune 500 company in the late Eighties and early Nineties.  

我认为苹果有机会成为八十年代末和九十年代初财富500强公司的典范。  

Ten to 15 years ago, if you asked people to make a list of the five most exciting companies in America, Polaroid and Xerox would have been on everyone’s list. Where are they now?  

10到15年前，如果你让人们列一个美国最令人兴奋的五家公司的名单，宝丽来和施乐会出现在每个人的名单上。他们现在在哪里？  

They would be on no one’s list today. What happened? Companies, as they grow to become multibillion-dollar entities, somehow lose their vision.  

今天，他们将不在任何人的名单上。发生了什么？公司在成长为数十亿美元的实体时，不知何故失去了他们的愿景。  

They insert lots of layers of middle management between the people running the company and the people doing the work.  

他们在管理公司的人和做工作的人之间插入了很多层的中间管理层。  

They no longer have an inherent feel or a passion about the products.  

他们对产品不再有固有的感觉或热情。  

The creative people, who are the ones who care passionately, have to persuade five layers of management to do what they know is the right thing to do.What happens in most companies is that you don’t keep great people under working environments where individual accomplishment is discouraged rather than encouraged.  

有创造力的人，也就是那些充满激情的人，必须说服五层的管理层去做他们知道是正确的事情。大多数公司的情况是，在不鼓励个人成就而不是鼓励个人成就的工作环境下，你无法留住伟大的人。  

The great people leave and you end up with mediocrity. I know, because that’s how Apple was built. Apple is an Ellis Island company. Apple is built on refugees from other companies.  

优秀的人离开了，你最终会得到平庸的结果。我知道，因为这就是苹果公司的建立过程。苹果是一家埃利斯岛公司。苹果是建立在来自其他公司的难民之上。  

These are the extremely bright individual contributors who were troublemakers at other companies. You know, Dr.  

这些是极其聪明的个人贡献者，他们在其他公司是麻烦制造者。你知道，博士。  

Edwin Land was a troublemaker. He dropped out of Harvard and founded Polaroid.  

埃德温-兰德是一个麻烦制造者。他从哈佛大学辍学，创办了宝丽来公司。  

Not only was he one of the great inventors of our time but, more important, he saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that.  

他不仅是我们这个时代的伟大发明家之一，而且更重要的是，他看到了艺术、科学和商业的交叉点，并建立了一个反映这一点的组织。  

Polaroid did that for some years, but eventually Dr.  

宝丽来做了一些年，但最终博士。  

Land, one of those brilliant troublemakers, was asked to leave his own company—which is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard of.  

陆，那些出色的麻烦制造者之一，被要求离开自己的公司--这是我听说过的最愚蠢的事情之一。  

So Land, at 75, went off to spend the remainder of his life doing pure science, trying to crack the code of color vision. The man is a national treasure.  

因此，兰德在75岁的时候，去做纯科学工作，试图破解色觉的密码，度过他的余生。这个人是个国宝。  

I don’t understand why people like that can’t be held up as models: This is the most incredible thing to be—not an astronaut, not a football player—but this. Anyway, one of our biggest challenges, and the one I think John Sculley and I should be judged on in five to ten years, is making Apple an incredibly great ten- or 20-billion-dollar company.  

我不明白为什么这样的人不能被当作楷模来举：这是最不可思议的事情，不是宇航员，不是足球运动员，而是这个。总之，我们最大的挑战之一，也是我认为约翰-斯库利和我在五到十年内应该被评判的挑战，就是使苹果成为一个令人难以置信的伟大的100或200亿美元的公司。  

Will it still have the spirit it does today? We’re charting new territory.  

它还会有今天这样的精神吗？我们正在规划新的领域。  

There are no models that we can look to for our high growth, for some of the new management concepts we have. So we’re having to find our own way.  

对于我们的高增长，对于我们的一些新的管理概念，没有可以参考的模式。所以我们必须找到自己的方式。

If Apple is really that kind of company, then why the projected twenty-fold growth? Why not stay relatively small?  

如果苹果真的是这样的公司，那么为什么预计会有20倍的增长？为什么不保持相对较小的规模？

The way it’s going to work out is that in our business, in order to continue to be one of the major contributors, we’re going to have to be a ten-billion-dollar company.  

其结果是，在我们的业务中，为了继续成为主要贡献者之一，我们将不得不成为一个百亿美元的公司。  

That growth is required for us to keep up with the competition.  

这种增长是我们跟上竞争的需要。  

Our concern is how we become that, rather than the dollar goal, which is meaningless to us. At Apple, people are putting in 18-hour days.  

我们关心的是我们如何成为这样的人，而不是美元目标，这对我们毫无意义。在苹果公司，人们每天要工作18个小时。  

We attract a different type of person—a person who doesn’t want to wait five or ten years to have someone take a giant risk on him or her.  

我们吸引了不同类型的人--一个不想等上五年或十年才让人在他或她身上承担巨大风险的人。  

Someone who really wants to get in a little over his head and make a little dent in the universe. We are aware that we are doing something significant.  

一个真正想在自己的头顶上搞点小动作，在宇宙中搞点小动作的人。我们意识到，我们正在做一些重要的事情。  

We’re here at the beginning of it and we’re able to shape how it goes. Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.  

我们在这里处于它的开始，我们能够塑造它的发展。这里的每个人都有这样的感觉：现在是我们影响未来的时刻之一。  

Most of the time, we’re taking things.  

大多数时候，我们都在拿东西。  

Neither you nor I made the clothes we wear; we don’t make the food or grow the foods we eat; we use a language that was developed by other people; we use another society’s mathematics.  

我们穿的衣服不是你和我做的；我们吃的食物不是我们做的，也不是我们种的；我们使用的语言是由其他人开发的；我们使用的是另一个社会的数学。  

Very rarely do we get a chance to put something back into that pool. I think we have that opportunity now. And no, we don’t know where it will lead.  

我们很少有机会把东西放回这个池子里。我认为我们现在有这个机会。不，我们不知道它将导致什么。  

We just know there’s something much bigger than any of us here.  

我们只知道这里有比我们任何人都大得多的东西。

You’ve said that the business market is crucial for you to conquer with Macintosh. Can you beat IBM at work?  

你已经说过，商业市场对你用Macintosh征服是至关重要的。你能在工作中打败IBM吗？

Yes. The business market has several sectors. Rather than just thinking of the Fortune 500, which is where IBM is strongest, I like to think of the Fortune 5,000,000 or 14,000,000. There are 14,000,000 small businesses in this country.  

是的。商业市场有几个部门。与其只考虑财富500强，也就是IBM最强的地方，我喜欢考虑财富500万或14000万。在这个国家有14,000,000家小企业。  

I think that the vast group of people who need to be computerized includes that large number of medium and small businesses.  

我认为，需要计算机化的广大群体包括那一大批中小型企业。  

We’re going to try to be able to bring some meaningful solutions to them in 1985.  

我们将努力能够在1985年给他们带来一些有意义的解决方案。

How? 如何？

Our approach is to think of them not as businesses but as collections of people. We want to qualitatively change the way people work.  

我们的方法是不把它们看作是企业，而是把它们看作是人的集合。我们希望从质量上改变人们的工作方式。  

We don’t just want to help them do word processing faster or add numbers faster. We want to change the way they can communicate with one another.  

我们不只是想帮助他们更快地进行文字处理或更快地添加数字。我们想改变他们彼此之间的沟通方式。  

We’re seeing five-page memos get compressed to one-page memos because we can use a picture to express the key concept.  

我们看到五页的备忘录被压缩到一页，因为我们可以用一张图片来表达关键概念。  

We’re seeing less paper flying around and more quality of communication. And it’s more fun.  

我们看到飞来飞去的纸张减少了，沟通的质量提高了。而且它更有乐趣。  

There’s always been this myth that really neat, fun people at home all of a sudden have to become very dull and boring when they come to work. It’s simply not true.  

一直以来，都有这样一个神话，即在家里非常整洁、有趣的人，到了工作中就会突然变得非常沉闷和无聊。这根本不是真的。  

If we can inject that liberal-arts spirit into the very serious realm of business, I think it will be a worthwhile contribution. We can’t even conceive of how far it will go.  

如果我们能将这种自由艺术精神注入非常严肃的商业领域，我认为这将是一个值得的贡献。我们甚至无法想象它能走多远。

But in the business market, you’re fighting the IBM name as much as anything. People associate IBM with stability and efficiency.  

但在商业市场上，你在与IBM的名字作斗争，就像任何事情一样。人们将IBM与稳定性和效率联系起来。  

The new entry in the computer field, A.T.&T., has that one up on you, too.  

计算机领域的新条目，A.T.&T.，也有这一条了。  

Apple is a relatively young and untested company, particularly in the eyes of corporations that might be customers.  

苹果是一家相对年轻和未经测试的公司，特别是在可能成为客户的企业眼中。

It’s Macintosh’s job to really penetrate the business market place. IBM focuses on the top down, the mainframe centric approach to selling in businesses.  

真正渗透到商业市场是Macintosh的工作。IBM专注于自上而下，以大型机为中心的企业销售方式。  

If we are going to be successful, we’ve got to approach this from a grass-roots point of view.  

如果我们要取得成功，我们必须从基层的角度来处理这个问题。  

To use networking as an example, rather than focusing on wiring up whole companies, as IBM is doing, we’re going to focus on the phenomenon of the small work group.  

以网络为例，与其关注整个公司的布线，如IBM正在做的那样，我们要关注小工作小组的现象。

One of the experts in the field says that for this industry to really flourish, and for it to benefit the consumer, one standard has to prevail.  

该领域的一位专家说，为使这一行业真正蓬勃发展，并使消费者受益，必须以一个标准为准。

That’s simply untrue. Insisting that we need one standard now is like saying that they needed one standard for automobiles in 1920. There would have been no innovations such as the automatic transmission, power steering and independent suspension if they believed that.  

这根本不是事实。坚持说我们现在需要一个标准，就像说他们在1920年需要一个汽车标准。如果他们相信这一点，就不会有诸如自动变速器、动力转向和独立悬挂等创新。  

The last thing we want to do is freeze technology. With computers, Macintosh is revolutionary. There is no question that Macintosh’s technology is superior to IBM’s.  

我们想做的最后一件事是冻结技术。对于计算机，Macintosh是革命性的。毫无疑问，Macintosh的技术要优于IBM的技术。  

There is a clear need for an alternative to IBM.  

显然需要有一个替代IBM的方案。

Was any of your decision not to become compatible with IBM based on the fact that you didn’t want to knuckle under to IBM?  

你决定不与IBM兼容，是否基于你不想向IBM屈服的事实？  

One critic says that the reason Mac isn’t IBM-compatible is mere arrogance—that “Steve Jobs was saying ‘Fuck you’ to IBM.”  

一位评论家说，Mac不与IBM兼容的原因仅仅是傲慢--"史蒂夫-乔布斯在对IBM说'去你的'"。

It wasn’t that we had to express our manhood by being different, no.  

这并不是说我们必须通过与众不同来表达我们的男子气概，不是。

Then why were you?  

那你为什么要去？

The main thing is very simply that the technology we developed is superior. It could not be this good if we became compatible with IBM.  

最主要的是非常简单，我们开发的技术是卓越的。如果我们与IBM兼容，它就不可能这么好。  

Of course, it’s true that we don’t want IBM to dominate this industry. A lot of people thought we were nuts for not being IBM-compatible, for not living under IBM’s umbrella.    

There were two key reasons we chose to bet our company on not doing that: The first was that we thought—and I think as history is unfolding, we’re being proved correct—that IBM would fold its umbrella on the companies making compatible computers and absolutely crush them. Second and more important, we did not go IBM-compatible because of the product vision that drives this company.    

We think that computers are the most remarkable tools that humankind has ever come up with, and we think that people are basically tool users.    

So if we can just get lots of computers to lots of people, it will make some qualitative difference in the world.    

What we want to do at Apple is make computers into appliances and get them to tens of millions of people. That’s simply what we want to do.    

And we couldn’t do that with the current IBM-generation type of technology. So we had to do something different. That’s why we came up with the Macintosh. 

From 1981 to 1983, your share of the personal-computer sales slipped from 29 percent to 23 percent. IBM’s part has grown from three percent to 28 percent in the same time.    

How do you fight the numbers? 

We’ve never worried about numbers. In the market place, Apple is trying to focus the spotlight on products, because products really make a difference.    

IBM is trying to focus the spotlight on service, support, security, mainframes and motherhood.    

Now, Apple’s key observation three years ago was that when you’re shipping 10,000,000 computers a year, even IBM does not have enough mothers to ship one with every computer.    

So you’ve got to build motherhood into the computer. And that’s a big part of what Macintosh is all about. All these things show that it really is coming down to just Apple and IBM.  

因此，你必须将母性建立在计算机中。而这正是Macintosh的一个重要部分。所有这些事情表明，它真的要归结为苹果和IBM了。

If, for some reason, we make some giant mistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter sort of a computer Dark Ages for about 20 years.

  

如果由于某种原因，我们犯了一些巨大的错误，而IBM赢了，我个人的感觉是，我们将进入某种计算机的黑暗时代，大约20年。  

Once IBM gains control of a market sector, they almost always stop innovation. They prevent innovation from happening.  

一旦IBM获得对一个市场领域的控制，他们几乎总是阻止创新。他们阻止创新的发生。

Why? 为什么？

Look at this example: Frito-Lay is a very interesting company. They call on more than half a million accounts a week.  

看看这个例子：Frito-Lay是一家非常有趣的公司。他们每周要拜访50多万个账户。  

There’s a Frito-Lay rack in each store, and the chips are all there, and every store’s got the identical rack and the big ones have multiples.  

每家商店都有一个Frito-Lay货架，薯片都在那里，每家商店都有相同的货架，大的商店有多个。  

For Frito-Lay, the biggest problem is stale product—bad chips, so to speak.  

对Frito-Lay来说，最大的问题是产品过期--可以说是坏的芯片。  

For Frito-Lay’s service, they’ve got, like, 10,000 guys who run around and take out the stale product and replace it with good product.  

对于Frito-Lay的服务，他们有大约10,000名员工，他们跑来跑去，把过期的产品拿出来，换上好的产品。  

They talk to the manager of that department and they make sure everything’s fine.  

他们与该部门的经理交谈，确保一切顺利。  

Because of that service and support, they now have more than an 80 percent share of every segment of chips that they’re in. Nobody else can break into that.  

由于这种服务和支持，他们现在在他们所处的每个芯片领域都有超过80%的份额。没有其他人能进入这个领域。  

As long as they keep doing what they do well, nobody else can get 80 percent of the market share, because they can’t get the sales and support staff.  

只要他们继续做他们擅长的事情，其他人就无法获得80%的市场份额，因为他们无法获得销售和支持人员。  

They can’t get it because they can’t afford it. They can’t afford it because they don’t have 80 percent of the market share. It’s catch-22. Nobody will ever be able to break into their franchise.  

他们不能得到它，因为他们买不起它。他们买不起是因为他们没有80%的市场份额。这是个陷阱。没有人能够闯入他们的专营权。  

Frito-Lay doesn’t have to innovate very much.  

Frito-Lay不需要太多创新。  

They just watch all the little chip companies come out with something new, study it for a year, and a year or two years later they come out with their own, service and support it to death, and they’ve got 80 percent of the market share of the new product a year later. IBM is playing exactly the same game.    

If you look at the mainframe market place, there’s been virtually zero innovation since IBM got dominant control of that market place 15 years ago.    

They are going to do the same thing in every other sector of the computer market place if they can get away with it.    

The IBM PC fundamentally brought no new technology to the industry at all. It was just repackaging and slight extension of Apple II technology, and they want it all.    

They absolutely want it all. This market place is coming down to the two of us, whether we like it or not.    

I don’t particularly like it, but it’s coming down to Apple and IBM. 

How can you say that about an industry that’s changing so fast? Macintosh is the hot new thing right now, but will it still be in two years?    

Aren’t you competing with your own philosophy? Just as you’re after IBM, aren’t there small computer companies coming after Apple? 

In terms of supplying the computer itself, it’s coming down to Apple and IBM.    

And I don’t think there are going to be a lot of third- and fourth-place companies, much less sixth- or seventh-place companies.    

Most of the new, innovative companies are focusing on the software. I think there will be lots of innovation in the areas of software but not in hardware. 

IBM might say the same thing about hardware, but you’re not about to let it get away with that. Why is your point any different? 

I think that the scale of the business has gotten large enough so that it’s going to be very difficult for anyone to successfully launch anything new. 

No more billion-dollar companies hatched in garages? 

No, I’m afraid not in computers. And this puts a responsibility on Apple, because if there’s going to be innovation in this industry, it’ll come from us.    

It’s the only way we can compete with them. If we go fast enough, they can’t keep up. 

When do you think IBM will finally, as you put it, fold the umbrella on the companies making IBM-compatible computers? 

There may be some imitators left in the $100,000,000-to-$200,000,000 range, but being a $200,000,000 company is going to mean you are struggling for your life, and that’s not really a position from which to innovate.    

Not only do I think IBM will do away with its imitators by providing software they can’t provide, I think eventually it will come up with a new standard that won’t even be compatible with what it’s making now—because it is to limiting. 

Which is exactly what you’ve done at Apple. If a person owns software for the Apple II, he can’t run it on the Macintosh. 

That’s right. Mac is altogether new.    

We knew that we could reach the early innovators with current-generation technology—Apple II, IBM PC—because they’d stay up all night learning how to use their computer.    

But we’d never reach the majority of people.    

If we were really going to get computers to tens of millions of people, we needed a technology that would make the thing radically easier to use and more powerful at the same time, so we had to make a break.    

We just had to do it. We wanted to make sure it was great, because it may be the last chance that any of us get to make a clean break.    

And I’m very happy with the way Macintosh turned out.    

It will prove a really solid foundation for the next ten years. 

Let’s go back to the predecessors of the Lisa and the Mac, to the beginning. How influential were your parents in your interest in computers? 

They encouraged my interests. My father was a machinist, and he was a sort of genius with his hands.    

He can fix anything and make it work and take any mechanical thing apart and get it back together. That was my first glimpse of it.    

I started to gravitate more toward electronics, and he used to get me things I could take apart and put back together. He was transferred to Palo Alto when I was five.    

That’s how we ended up in the Valley. 

You had been adopted, hadn’t you? How much of a factor in your life was that? 

You don’t ever really know, do you? 

Did you try to find your biological parents? 

I think it’s quite a natural curiosity for adopted people to want to understand where certain traits come from. But I’m mostly an environmentalist.    

I think the way you are raised and your values and most of your world view come from the experiences you had as you grew up. But some things aren’t accounted for that way.    

I think it’s quite natural to have a curiosity about it. And I did. 

Were you successful in trying to find your natural parents? 

That’s one area I really don’t want to talk about. 

The valley your parents moved to has since come to be known as Silicon Valley. What was it like growing up there? 

It was the suburbs. It was like most suburbs in the U.S.: I grew up on a block with lots of kids.    

My mother taught me to read before I went to school, so I was pretty bored in school, and I turned into a little terror. You should have seen us in third grade.    

We basically destroyed our teacher. We would let snakes loose in the classroom and explode bombs. Things changed in the fourth grade, though.    

One of the saints in my life is this woman named Imogene Hill, who was a fourth-grade teacher who taught this advanced class.    

She got hip to my whole situation in about a month and kindled a passion in me for learning things. I learned more that year than I think I learned in any year in school.    

They wanted to put me in high school after that year, but my parents very wisely wouldn’t let them. 

But location had something to do with your interests, didn’t it? How did Silicon Valley come to be? 

The Valley is positioned strategically between two great universities, Berkeley and Stanford.    

Both of those universities attract not only lots of students but very good students and ones from all over the United States.    

They come here and fall in love with the area and they stay here.    

So there is a constant influx of new, bright human resources. Before World War Two, two Stanford graduates named Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard created a very innovative electronics company—Hewlett-Packard.    

Then the transistor was invented in 1948 by Bell Telephone Laboratories.    

One of the three coinventors of the transistor, William Shockley, decided to return to his home town of Palo Alto to start a little company called Shockley Labs or something.    

He brought with him about a dozen of the best and brightest physicists and chemists of his day.    

Little by little, people started breaking off and forming competitive companies, like those flowers or weeds that scatter seeds in hundreds of directions when you blow on them.    

And that’s why the Valley is here today. 

What was your introduction to computers? 

A neighbor down the block named Larry Lang was an engineer at Hewlett-Packard. He spent a lot of time with me, teaching me stuff.    

The first computer I ever saw was at Hewlett-Packard. They used to invite maybe ten of us down every Tuesday night and give us lectures and let us work with a computer.    

I was maybe 12 the first time. I remember the night. They showed us one of their new desktop computers and let us play on it. I wanted one badly. 

What was it about it that interested you? Did you have a sense of its potential? 

It wasn’t anything like that. I just thought they were neat. I just wanted to mess around with one. 

You went to work for Hewlett-Packard. How did that happen? 

When I was 12 or 13, I wanted to build something and I needed some parts, so I picked up the phone and called Bill Hewlett—he was listed in the Palo Alto phone book.    

He answered the phone and he was real nice. He chatted with me for, like, 20 minutes.    

He didn’t know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters.    

Assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn’t matter; I was in heaven.    

I remember my first day, expressing my complete enthusiasm and bliss at being at Hewlett-Packard for the summer to my supervisor, a guy named Chris, telling him that my favorite thing in the whole world was electronics.    

I asked him what his favorite thing to do was and he looked at me and said, “To fuck!” \[Laughs\] I learned a lot that summer. 

At what point did you meet Steve Wozniak? 

I met Woz when I was 13, at a friend’s garage. He was about 18. He was, like, the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point.    

We became good friends, because we shared an interest in computers and we had a sense of humor. We pulled all kinds of pranks together. 

For instance? 

\[Grins\] Normal stuff. Like making a huge flag with a giant one of these on it \[gives the finger\]. The idea was that we would unfurl it in the middle of a school graduation.    

Then there was the time Wozniak made something that looked and sounded like a bomb and took it to the school cafeteria. We also went into the blue-box business together. 

Those were illegal devices that allowed free long-distance phone calls, weren’t they? 

Mm-hm. The famous story about the boxes is when Woz called the Vatican and told them he was Henry Kissinger.    

They had someone going to wake the Pope up in the middle of the night before they figured out it wasn’t really Kissinger. 

Did you get into trouble for any of those things? 

Well, I was thrown out of school a few times. 

Were you then, or have you ever been, a computer nerd? 

I wasn’t completely in any one world for too long. There was so much else going on.    

Between my sophomore and junior years, I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas and all that classic stuff.    

I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative-writing classes.    

By the time I was a senior, I’d gotten permission to spend about half my time at Stanford, taking classes. 

Was Wozniak obsessed at certain periods? 

\[Laughs\] Yes, but not just with computers. I think Woz was in a world that nobody understood. No one shared his interests, and he was a little ahead of his time.    

It was very lonely for him. He’s driven from inner sights rather than external expectations of him, so he survived OK.    

Woz and I are different in most ways, but there are some ways in which we’re the same, and we’re very close in those ways.    

We’re sort of like two planets in their own orbits that every so often intersect. It wasn’t just computers, either.    

Woz and I very much liked Bob Dylan’s poetry, and we spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of that stuff. This was California. You could get LSD fresh made from Stanford.    

You could sleep on the beach at night with your girlfriend. California has a sense of experimentation and a sense of openness—openness to new possibilities.    

Besides Dylan, I was interested in Eastern mysticism, which hit the shores at about the same time.    

When I went to college at Reed, in Oregon, there was a constant flow of people stopping by, from Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert to Gary Snyder.    

There was a constant flow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life.    

That was a time when every college student in this country read Be Here Now and Diet for a Small Planet—there were about ten books.    

You’d be hard pressed to find those books on too many college campuses today. I’m not saying it’s better or worse; it’s just different—very different.    

In Search of Excellence \[the book about business practices\] has taken the place of Be Here Now. 

In retrospect, how did that influence what you’re doing now? 

The whole period had a huge influence.    

As it was clear that the Sixties were over, it was also clear that a lot of the people who had gone through the Sixties ended up not really accomplishing what they set out to accomplish, and because they had thrown their discipline to the wind, they didn’t have much to fall back on.    

Many of my friends have ended up ingrained with the idealism of that period but also with a certain practicality, a cautiousness about ending up working behind the counter in a natural-food store when they are 45, which is what they saw happen to some of their older friends.    

It’s not that that is bad in and of itself, but it’s bad if that’s not what you really wanted to do. 

After Reed, you returned to Silicon Valley and answered a now-famous ad that boasted, “Have fun and make money.” 

Right. I decided I wanted to travel, but I was lacking the necessary funds. I came back down to get a job.    

I was looking in the paper and there was this ad that said, yes, “Have fun and make money.” I called. It was Atari. I had never had a job before other than the one when I was a kid.  

By some stroke of luck, they called me up the next day and hired me.

That must have been at Atari’s earliest stage. 

I was, like, employee number 40. It was a very small company. They had made Pong and two other games.    

My first job was helping a guy named Don work on a basketball game, which was a disaster. There was this basketball game, and somebody was working on a hockey game.    

They were trying to model all their games after simple field sports at that time, because Pong was such a success. 

You never lost sight of the reason for the job: to earn money so you could travel. 

Atari had shipped a bunch of games to Europe and they had some engineering defects in them, and I figured out how to fix them, but it was necessary for somebody to go over there and actually do the fixing.    

I volunteered to go and asked to take a leave of absence when I was there. They let me do it. I ended up in Switzerland and moved from Zurich to New Delhi.    

I spent some time in India. 

Where you shaved your head. 

That’s not quite the way it happened. I was walking around in the Himalayas and I stumbled onto this thing that turned out to be a religious festival.    

There was a baba, a holy man, who was the holy man of this particular festival, with his large group of followers. I could smell good food.    

I hadn’t been fortunate enough to smell good food for a long time, so I wandered up to pay my respects and eat some lunch.    

For some reason, this baba, upon seeing me sitting there eating, immediately walked over to me and sat down and burst out laughing.    

He didn’t speak much English and I spoke a little Hindi, but he tried to carry on a conversation and he was just rolling on the ground with laughter.    

Then he grabbed my arm and took me up this mountain trail.    

It was a little funny, because here were hundreds of Indians who had traveled for thousands of miles to hang out with this guy for ten seconds and I stumble in for something to eat and he’s dragging me up this mountain path. We get to the top of this mountain half an hour later and there’s this little well and pond at the top of this mountain, and he dunks my head in the water and pulls out a razor from his pocket and starts to shave my head.    

I’m completely stunned.    

I’m 19 years old, in a foreign country, up in the Himalayas, and here is this bizarre Indian baba who has just dragged me away from the rest of the crowd, shaving my head atop this mountain peak.    

I’m still not sure why he did it. 

What did you do when you came back? 

Coming back was more of a culture shock than going. Well, Atari called me up and wanted me to go back to work there.    

I didn’t really want to, but eventually they persuaded me to go back as a consultant. Wozniak and I were hanging out.    

He took me to some Homebrew Computer Club meetings, where computer hobbyists compared notes and stuff. I didn’t find them all that exciting, but some of them were fun.    

Wozniak went religiously. 

What was the thinking about computers then? Why were you interested? 

The clubs were based around a computer kit called the Altair.    

It was so amazing to all of us that somebody had actually come up with a way to build a computer you could own yourself. That had never been possible.    

Remember, when we were in high school, neither of us had access to a computer mainframe.    

We had to drive somewhere and have some large company take a benevolent attitude toward us and let us use the computer.    

But now, for the first time, you could actually buy a computer.    

The Altair was a kit that came out around 1975 and sold for less than $400. Even though it was relatively inexpensive, not everyone could afford one.    

That’s how the computer clubs started. People would band together and eventually become a club. 

What would you do with your makeshift computers? 

At that time, there were no graphics. It was all alphanumerics, and I used to be fascinated with the programming, simple programming.    

On the very early versions of computer kits, you didn’t even type; you threw switches that signaled characters. 

The Altair, then, presented the concept of a home computer. 

It was just sort of a computer that you could own. They really didn’t know what to do with it.    

The first thing that they did was to put languages on it, so you could write some programs. People didn’t start to apply them for practical things until a year or two later, and then it was simple things, like bookkeeping. 

And you decided you could do the Altair one better. 

It sort of just happened. I was working a lot at Atari at night and I used to let Woz in.    

Atari put out a game called Gran Track, the first driving game with a steering wheel to drive it. Woz was a Gran Track addict.    

He would put great quantities of quarters into these games to play them, so I would just let him in at night and let him onto the production floor and he would play Gran Track all night long.    

When I came up against a stumbling block on a project, I would get Woz to take a break from his road rally for ten minutes and come and help me.    

He puttered around on some things, too.    

And at one point, he designed a computer terminal with video on it.    

At a later date, he ended up buying a microprocessor and hooking it up to the terminal and made what was to become the Apple I.    

Woz and I laid out the circuit board ourselves. That was basically it. 

Again, the idea was just to do it? 

Yeah, sure. And to be able to show it off to your friends. 

What triggered the next step—manufacturing and selling them to make money? 

Woz and I raised $1300 by selling my VW bus and his Hewlett-Packard calculator to finance them.    

A guy who started one of the first computer stores told us he could sell them if we could make them. It had not dawned on us until then. 

How did you and Wozniak work together? 

He designed most of it. I helped on the memory part and I helped when we decided to turn it into a product.    

Woz isn’t great at turning things into products, but he’s really a brilliant designer. 

The Apple I was for hobbyists? 

Completely. We sold only about 150 of them, ever. It wasn’t that big a deal, but we made about $95,000 and I started to see it as a business besides something to do.    

Apple I was just a printed circuit board. There was no case, there was no power supply; it wasn’t much of a product yet. It was just a printed circuit board.    

You had to go out and buy transformers for it. You had to buy your own keyboard \[laughs\]. 

Did you and Wozniak have a vision once things started rolling? Were you both thinking about how big it could get and how computers would be able to change the world? 

No, not particularly. Neither of us had any idea that this would go anywhere. Woz is motivated by figuring things out.    

He concentrated more on the engineering and proceeded to do one of his most brilliant pieces of work, which was the disk drive, another key engineering feat that made the Apple II a possibility.    

I was trying to build the company—trying to find out what a company was. I don’t think it would have happened without Woz and I don’t think it would have happened without me. 

What happened to the partnership as time went on? 

The main thing was that Woz was never really interested in Apple as a company.    

He was just sort of interested in getting the Apple II on a printed circuit board so he could have one and be able to carry it to his computer club without having the wires break on the way.    

He had done that and decided to go on to other things. He had other ideas. 

Such as the US Festival rock concert and computer show, where he lost something like $10,000,000. 

Well, I thought the US Festival was a little crazy, but Woz believed very strongly in it. 

How is it between the two of you now? 

When you work with somebody that close and you go through experiences like the ones we went through, there’s a bond in life. Whatever hassles you have, there is a bond.    

And even though he may not be your best friend as time goes on, there’s still something that transcends even friendship, in a way. Woz is living his own life now.    

He hasn’t been around Apple for about five years. But what he did will go down in history. He’s going around speaking to a lot of computer events now. He likes that. 

The two of you went on to create the Apple II, which actually started the computer revolution. How did that occur? 

It wasn’t just us. We brought in other people. Wozniak still did the logic of the Apple II, which certainly is a large part of it, but there were some other key parts.    

The power supply was really a key. The case was really a key. The real jump with the Apple II was that it was a finished product.    

It was the first computer that you could buy that wasn’t a kit. It was fully assembled and had its own case and its own keyboard, and you could really sit down and start to use it.    

And that was the breakthrough of the Apple II: that it looked like a real product. 

Was the initial market hobbyists? 

The difference was that you didn’t have to be a hardware hobbyist with the Apple II. You could be a software hobbyist.    

That was one of the key breakthroughs with the Apple II: realizing that there were a whole lot more people who wanted to play with a computer, just like Woz and me, than there were people who could build their own.    

That’s what the Apple II was all about. Still, the first year, we sold only 3000 or 4000. 

Even that sounds like a lot for a few guys who barely knew what they were doing. 

It was giant! We did about $200,000 when our business was in the garage, in 1976. In 1977, about $7,000,000 in business. I mean, it was phenomenal! And in 1978, we did $17,000,000. In 1979, we did $47,000,000. That’s when we all really sensed that this was just going through the rafters.    

In 1980, we did $117,000,000. In 1981, we did $335,000,000. In 1982, we did $583,000,000. In 1983, we did $985,000,000, I think. This year, it will be a billion and a half. 

You don’t forget those numbers. 

Well, they’re just yardsticks, you know. The neatest thing was, by 1979, I was able to walk into classrooms that had 15 Apple computers and see the kids using them.    

And those are the kinds of things that are really the milestones. 

Which brings us full circle to your latest milestones, the Mac and your protracted shoot-out with IBM.    

In this Interview, you’ve repeatedly sounded as if there really are only two of you left in the field.    

But although the two of you account for something like 60 percent of the market, can you just write off the other 40 percent—the Radio Shacks, DECs, Epsons, et al.—as insignificant?  

More important, are you ignoring your potentially biggest rival, A.T.&T.?

A.T.&T.. is absolutely going to be in the business. There is a major transformation in the company that’s taking place right now. A.T.&T.    

is changing from a subsidized and regulated service-oriented company to a free-market, competitive-marketing technology company.    

A.T.&T.’s products per se have never been of the highest quality. All you have to do is go look at their telephones. They’re somewhat of an embarrassment.    

But they do possess great technology in their research labs. Their challenge is to learn how to commercialize that technology. Also, they have to learn about consumer marketing.    

I think that they will do both of those things, but it’s going to take them years. 

Are you writing them off as a threat? 

I don’t think they’re going to be a giant factor in the next 24 months, but they will learn. 

What about Radio Shack? 

Radio Shack is totally out of the picture. They have missed the boat.    

Radio Shack tried to squeeze the computer into their model of retailing, which in my opinion often meant selling second-rate products or low-end products in a surplus-store environment.    

The sophistication of the computer buyer passed Radio Shack by without their really realizing it. Their market shares dropped through the floor.    

I don’t anticipate that they’re going to recover and again become a major player. 

How about Xerox? Texas Instruments? DEC? Wang? 

Xerox is out of the business. T.I. is doing nowhere near their expectations. As to some of the others, the large companies, like DEC and Wang, can sell to their installed bases.    

They can sell personal computers as advanced terminals, but that business is going to dwindle. 

How about the low-priced computers: Commodore and Atari? 

I consider those a brochure for why you should buy an Apple II or Macintosh. I think people have already determined that the sub-$500 computers don’t do very much.    

They either tease people to want more or frustrate people completely. 

What about some of the smaller portables? 

They are OK if you’re a reporter and trying to take notes on the run.    

But for the average person, they’re really not that useful, and there’s not all that software for them, either.    

By the time you get your software done, a new one comes out with a slightly bigger display and your software is obsolete. So nobody is writing any software for them.    

Wait till we do it—the power of a Macintosh in something the size of a book! 

What about Epson and some of the Japanese computer makers? 

I’ve said it before: The Japanese have hit the shores like dead fish. They’re just like dead fish washing up on the shores. The Epson has been a failure in this market place. 

Like computers, the automobile industry was an American industry that we almost lost to the Japanese.    

There is a lot of talk about American semiconductor companies’ losing ground to Japanese. How will you keep the edge? 

Japan’s very interesting. Some people think it copies things. I don’t think that anymore. I think what they do is reinvent things.    

They will get something that’s already been invented and study it until they thoroughly understand it. In some cases, they understand it better than the original inventor.    

Out of that understanding, they will reinvent it in a more refined second-generation version.    

That strategy works only when what they’re working with isn’t changing very much—the stereo industry and the automobile industry are two examples.    

When the target is moving quickly, they find it very difficult, because that reinvention cycle takes a few years.    

As long as the definition of what a personal computer is keeps changing at the rate that it is, they will have a very hard time.    

Once the rate of change slows down, the Japanese will bring all of their strengths to bear on this market, because they absolutely want to dominate the computer business; there’s no question about that.    

They see that as a national priority. We think that in four to five years, the Japanese will finally figure out how to build a decent computer.    

And if we’re going to keep this industry one in which America leads, we have four years to become world-class manufacturers.    

Our manufacturing technology has to equal or surpass that of the Japanese. 

How do you plan to accomplish that? 

At the time we designed Macintosh, we also designed a machine to build the machine. We spent $20,000,000 building the computer industry’s most automated factory.    

But that’s not enough. Rather than take seven years to write off our factory, as most companies would do, we’re writing it off in two.    

We will throw it away at the end of 1985 and build our second one, and we will write that off in two years and throw that away, so that three years from now, we’ll be on to our third automated factory.  

That’s the only way we can learn fast enough.

It’s not all competition with the Japanese: You buy your disk drives from Sony, for instance. 

We buy many of our components from the Japanese. We’re the largest user in the world of microprocessors, of high-technology RAM chips, of disk drives, of keyboards.    

We save a ton of energy not having to make and design floppy-disk drives or microprocessors that we can spend on software. 

Let’s talk about software. What are the revolutionary changes in software development as you’ve seen it in the past few years? 

Certainly, the earlier programming, getting a programming language on a microprocessor chip, was a real breakthrough.    

VisiCalc was a breakthrough, because that was the first real use of computers in business, where business people could see tangible benefits of using one.    

Before that, you had to program your own applications, and the number of people who want to program is a small fraction—one percent.    

Coupled with VisiCalc, the ability to graph things, graph information, was important, and so was Lotus. 

We’re dropping a lot of brand names with which people may not be familiar. Please explain them. 

What Lotus did was combine a good spread sheet and graphics program. The word-processing and data-base parts of Lotus are certainly not the most robust that one can purchase.    

The real key to Lotus was that it combined spread sheet and graphics in one program, so you could go between them very rapidly.    

The next breakthrough is happening now, thanks to the Macintosh, which brought that Lisa technology down to an affordable price.    

There exists, and there will be more, revolutionary software there. You generally want to truly evaluate a breakthrough a few years after it happens. 

What about word processing? You didn’t mention that on the list of breakthroughs. 

You’re right, I should have listed word processing after VisiCalc. Word processing is the most universally needed application and one of the easiest to understand.    

It’s probably the first use to which most people put their personal computer.    

There were word processors before personal computers, but a word processor on a personal computer was more of an economic breakthrough, while there was never any form of VisiCalc before the personal computer. 

Have there been breakthroughs in educational software? 

There has been a lot of very good software in education but not the breakthrough product, not the VisiCalc. I think that will come, but I don’t expect it in the next 24 months. 

You’ve stressed the fact that education is a high priority for you. How do you think computers are affecting it? 

Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.    

We formed something called the Apple Education Foundation, and we give several million dollars in cash and equipment to people doing exploratory work with educational software and to schools that can’t afford computers.    

We also wanted Macintosh to become the computer of choice in colleges, just as the Apple II is for grade and high schools.    

So we looked for six universities that were out to make large-scale commitments to personal computers—by large, meaning more than 1000 apiece—and instead of six, we found 24. We asked the colleges if they would invest at least $2,000,000 each to be part of the Macintosh program.    

All 24—including the entire Ivy League—did. So in less than a year, Macintosh has become the standard in college computing.    

I could ship every Macintosh we make this year just to those 24 colleges. We can’t, of course, but the demand is there. 

But the software isn’t there, is it? 

Some of it’s there. What’s not there, the people at colleges are going to write themselves.    

IBM tried to stop us—I hear it formed a 400-person task force to do it—by giving away IBM PCs. But the colleges were fairly astute.    

They realized the software investment they were about to embark upon would far outweigh the hardware investment, and they didn’t want to spend all that software money on old technology like IBM’s.    

So in many cases, they turned down IBM’s offers and went with Macintoshes. In some cases, they used IBM grant money to buy Macintoshes. 

Will you name some colleges? 

Can’t. I’d get them in trouble. 

When you were in college in precomputer days, what did you and your classmates feel was the way to make a contribution? Politics? 

None of the really bright people I knew in college went into politics.    

They all sensed that, in terms of making a change in the world, politics wasn’t the place to be in the late Sixties and Seventies.    

All of them are in business now—which is funny, because they were the same people who trekked off to India or who tried in one way or another to find some sort of truth about life. 

Wasn’t business and the lure of money merely the easy choice in the end? 

No, none of those people care about the money. I mean, a lot of them made a lot of money, but they don’t really care. Their lifestyles haven’t particularly changed.    

It was the chance to actually try something, to fail, to succeed, to grow. Politics wasn’t the place to be these past ten years if you were eager to try things out.    

As someone who hasn’t turned 30 yet, I think your 20s are the time to be impatient, and a lot of these people’s idealism would have been deeply frustrated in politics; it would have been blunted.    

I think it takes a crisis for something to occur in America.    

And I believe there’s going to be a crisis of significant proportions in the early Nineties as these problems our political leaders should have been addressing boil up to the surface.    

And that’s when a lot of these people are going to bring both their practical experience and their idealism into the political realm.    

You’re going to see the best-trained generation ever to go into politics. They’re going to know how to choose people, how to get things done, how to lead. 

Doesn’t every generation say that? 

These are different times.    

The technological revolution is more intertwined every day with our economy and our society—more than 50 percent of America’s gross national product comes from information-based industries—and most political leaders today have had no background in that revolution.    

It’s going to become crucial that many of the larger decisions we make—how we allot our resources, how we educate our children—be made with an understanding of the technical issues and the directions the technology is taking.    

And that hasn’t begun happening yet.    

In education, for example, we have close to a national embarrassment.    

In a society where information and innovation are going to be pivotal, there really is the possibility that America can become a second-rate industrial nation if we lose the technical momentum and leadership we have now. 

You mentioned investing in education, but isn’t the problem finding the funds in a time of soaring deficits? 

We’re making the largest investment of capital that humankind has ever made in weapons over the next five years.    

We have decided, as a society, that that’s where we should put our money, and that raises the deficits and, thus, the cost of our capital.    

Meanwhile, Japan, our nearest competitor on the next technological frontier—the semiconductor industry—has shaped its tax structure, its entire society, toward raising the capital to invest in that area.    

You get the feeling that connections aren’t made in America between things like building weapons and the fact that we might lose our semiconductor industry.    

We have to educate ourselves to that danger. 

And you think computers will help in that process. 

Well, I’ll tell you a story. I saw a video tape that we weren’t supposed to see. It was prepared for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    

By watching the tape, we discovered that, at least as of a few years ago, every tactical nuclear weapon in Europe manned by U.S. personnel was targeted by an Apple II computer.    

Now, we didn’t sell computers to the military; they went out and bought them at a dealer’s, I guess.    

But it didn’t make us feel good to know that our computers were being used to target nuclear weapons in Europe.    

The only bright side of it was that at least they weren’t \[Radio Shack\] TRS-80s! Thank God for that.    

The point is that tools are always going to be used for certain things we don’t find personally pleasing.    

And it’s ultimately the wisdom of people, not the tools themselves, that is going to determine whether or not these things are used in positive, productive ways. 

Where do you see computers and software going in the near future? 

Thus far, we’re pretty much using our computers as good servants.    

We ask them to do something, we ask them to do some operation like a spread sheet, we ask them to take our key strokes and make a letter out of them, and they do that pretty well.    

And you’ll see more and more perfection of that—computer as servant. But the next thing is going to be computer as guide or agent.    

And what that means is that it’s going to do more in terms of anticipating what we want and doing it for us, noticing connections and patterns in what we do, asking us if this is some sort of generic thing we’d like to do regularly, so that we’re going to have, as an example, the concept of triggers.  

We’re going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.

For example? 

Simple things like monitoring your stocks every hour or every day.    

When a stock gets beyond set limits, the computer will call my broker and electronically sell it and then let me know.    

Another example is that at the end of the month, the computer will go into the data base and find all the salesmen who exceeded their sales quotas by more than 20 percent and write them a personalized letter from me and send it over the electronic mail system to them, and give me a report on who it sent the letters to each month.    

There will be a time when our computers have maybe 100 or so of those tasks; they’re going to be much more like an agent for us.    

You’re going to see that start to happen a little bit in the next 12 months, but really, it’s about three years away. That’s the next breakthrough. 

Will we be able to perform all of those things on the hardware we have now? Or are you going to charge us for new machines? 

All? That would be a dangerous statement, using the word all. I don’t know about that. Macintosh was certainly designed with those concepts in mind. 

You take great pride in having Apple keep ahead. How do you feel about the older companies that have to play catch-up with the younger companies—or perish? 

That’s inevitably what happens. That’s why I think death is the most wonderful invention of life. It purges the system of these old models that are obsolete.    

I think that’s one of Apple’s challenges, really. When two young people walk in with the next thing, are we going to embrace it and say this is fantastic?    

Are we going to be willing to drop our models, or are we going to explain it away? I think we’ll do better, because we’re completely aware of it and we make it a priority. 

In thinking about your success, did you ever get to the point where you slapped your head and asked yourself what was happening? After all, it was virtually overnight. 

I used to think about selling 1,000,000 computers a year, but it was just a thought. When it actually happens, it’s a totally different thing.    

So it was, “Holy shit, it’s actually coming true!” But what’s hard to explain is that this does not feel like overnight. Next year will be my tenth year.    

I had never done anything longer than a year in my life. Six months, for me, was a long time when we started Apple.    

So this has been my life since I’ve been sort of a free-willed adult.    

Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experiences that a year is a lifetime at Apple. So this has been ten lifetimes. 

Do you know what you want to do with the rest of this lifetime? 

There’s an old Hindu saying that comes into my mind occasionally: “For the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits.    

For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.” As I’m going to be 30 in February, the thought has crossed my mind. 

And? 

And I’m not sure. I’ll always stay connected with Apple.    

I hope that throughout my life I’ll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry.    

There may be a few years when I’m not there, but I’ll always come back. And that’s what I may try to do. The key thing to remember about me is that I’m still a student.    

I’m still in boot camp. If anyone is reading any of my thoughts, I’d keep that in mind. Don’t take it all too seriously.    

If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much.    

You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away. What are we, anyway?    

Most of what we think we are is just a collection of likes and dislikes, habits, patterns.    

At the core of what we are is our values, and what decisions and actions we make reflect those values.    

That is why it’s hard doing interviews and being visible: As you are growing and changing, the more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you that it thinks you are, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to go, “Bye.    

I have to go. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently. 

You could take off. You certainly don’t have to worry about money. You’re still working—— 

\[Laughs\] Because of guilt. Guilt over the money. 

Let’s talk about the money. You were a millionaire at 23—— 

And when I was 24, my net worth was more than $10,000,000; when I was 25, it was more than $100,000,000. 

What’s the main difference between having $1,000,000 and having several hundred million? 

Visibility. The number of people who have a net worth of more than $1,000,000 in this country is in the tens of thousands.    

The number of people who have a net worth of more than $10,000,000 gets down to thousands. And the number who have a net worth of more than $100,000,000 gets down to a few hundred. 

What does the money actually mean to you? 

I still don’t understand it. It’s a large responsibility to have more than you can spend in your lifetime—and I feel I have to spend it.    

If you die, you certainly don’t want to leave a large amount to your children. It will just ruin their lives. And if you die without kids, it will all go to the Government.    

Almost everyone would think that he could invest the money back into humanity in a much more astute way than the Government could.    

The challenges are to figure out how to live with it and to reinvest it back into the world, which means either giving it away or using it to express your concerns or values. 

So what do you do? 

That’s a part of my life that I like to keep private. When I have some time, I’m going to start a public foundation. I do some things privately now. 

You could spend all of your time disbursing your money. 

Oh, you have to. I’m convinced that to give away a dollar effectively is harder than to make a dollar. 

Could that be an excuse to put off doing something? 

No. There are some simple reasons for that. One is that in order to learn how to do something well, you have to fail sometimes.    

In order to fail, there has to be a measurement system. And that’s the problem with most philanthropy—there’s no measurement system.    

You give somebody some money to do something and most of the time you can really never measure whether you failed or succeeded in your judgment of that person or his ideas or their implementation.    

So if you can’t succeed or fail, it’s really hard to get better. Also, most of the time, the people who come to you with ideas don’t provide the best ideas.    

You go seek the best ideas out, and that takes a lot of time. 

If you plan to use your visibility to create a model for people, why is this one of the areas you choose not to discuss? 

Because I haven’t done anything much yet. In that area, actions should speak the loudest. 

Are you completely virtuous or do you admit to any extravagances? 

Well, my favorite things in life are books, sushi and…. My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.    

As it is, I pay a price by not having much of a personal life.    

I don’t have the time to pursue love affairs or to tour small towns in Italy and sit in cafes and eat tomato-and-mozzarella salad.    

Occasionally, I spend a little money to save myself a hassle, which means time. And that’s the extent of it. I bought an apartment in New York, but it’s because I love that city.    

I’m trying to educate myself, being from a small town in California, not having grown up with the sophistication and culture of a large city. I consider it part of my education.    

You know, there are many people at Apple who can buy everything that they could ever possibly want and still have most of their money unspent.    

I hate talking about this as a problem; people are going to read this and think, Yeah, well, give me your problem. They’re going to think I’m an arrogant little asshole. 

With your wealth and past accomplishments, you have the ability to pursue dreams as few others do. Does that freedom frighten you? 

The minute you have the means to take responsibility for your own dreams and can be held accountable for whether they come true or not, life is a lot tougher.    

It’s easy to have wonderful thoughts when the chance to implement them is remote.    

When you’ve gotten to a place where you at least have a chance of implementing your ideas, there’s a lot more responsibility in that. 

We’ve talked about what you see in the near future; what about the far future?    

If we’re still in kindergarten, and you start imagining some of the ways computers are going to change our lives, what do you see? 

When I came back from India, I found myself asking, What was the one most important thing that had struck me?    

And I think it was that Western rational thought is not an innate human characteristic. It is a learned ability.    

It had never occurred to me that if no one taught us how to think this way, we would not think this way. And yet, that’s the way it is.    

Obviously, one of the great challenges of an education is to teach us how to think.    

What we’re finding is that computers are actually going to affect the quality of thinking as more and more of our children have these tools available to them. Humans are tool users.  

What’s really incredible about a book is that you can read what Aristotle wrote. You don’t have to have some teacher’s interpretation of Aristotle.

   

You can certainly get that, but you can read exactly what Aristotle wrote.    

That direct transmission of thoughts and ideas is one of the key building blocks of why we are where we are, as a society.    

But the problem with a book is that you can’t ask Aristotle a question.    

I think one of the potentials of the computer is to somehow … capture the fundamental, underlying principles of an experience. 

For example? 

Here’s a very crude example.    

The original video game, Pong, captured the principles of gravity, angular momentum and things like that, to where each game obeyed those underlying principles, and yet every game was different—sort of like life.    

That’s the simplest example.    

And what computer programming can do is to capture the underlying principles, the underlying essence, and then facilitate thousands of experiences based on that perception of the underlying principles.  

Now, what if we could capture Aristotle’s world view—the underlying principles of his world view? Then you could actually ask Aristotle a question. OK.

   

You might say it would not be exactly what Aristotle was.    

It could be all wrong. But maybe not. 

But you would say it was at least interesting feedback. 

Exactly.  

Part of the challenge, I think, is to get these tools to millions and tens of millions of people and to start to refine these tools so that someday we can crudely, and then in a more refined sense, capture an Aristotle or an Einstein or a Land while he’s alive.  

Imagine what that could be like for a young kid growing up. Forget the young kid—for us! And that’s part of the challenge.

Will you be working on that yourself? 

That’s for someone else. It’s for the next generation.    

I think an interesting challenge in this area of intellectual inquiry is to grow obsolete gracefully, in the sense that things are changing so fast that certainly by the end of the Eighties, we really want to turn over the reins to the next generation, whose fundamental perceptions are state-of-the-art perceptions, so that they can go on, stand on our shoulders and go much further.    

It’s a very interesting challenge, isn’t it? How to grow obsolete with grace.

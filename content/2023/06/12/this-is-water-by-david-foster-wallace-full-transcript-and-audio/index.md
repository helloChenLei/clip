Wallace hits on our need to manage rather than remove our core hard-wired human instincts.  

华莱士击中了我们对管理的需要，而不是消除我们核心的、硬性的人类本能。

Here are the links to the original audio followed by the entire speech.  

以下是原始音频的链接，随后是整个演讲的链接。

“Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys.  

"家长们好，祝贺凯尼恩大学2005届毕业班。有两条年轻的鱼在游动，他们碰巧遇到一条在另一边游动的老鱼，老鱼向他们点头并说："早上好，孩子们。  

How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”  

水怎么样了？"两条小鱼继续游了一会儿，最后其中一条看了看另一条，说："水到底是什么东西？"

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories.  

这是美国毕业典礼演讲的标准要求，即部署说教式的小寓言式的故事。  

The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be.  

故事的事情变成了一个更好的、不那么扯淡的体裁惯例，但如果你担心我打算在这里把自己作为聪明的、年长的鱼向你们这些年轻的鱼解释什么是水，请不要担心。  

I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.  

我不是那条聪明的老鱼。这个鱼的故事的重点只是，最明显、最重要的现实往往是最难看到和谈论的现实。  

Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.  

当然，作为一个英语句子，这只是一个平庸的陈词滥调，但事实上，在成人生存的日常战壕中，平庸的陈词滥调可能具有生死攸关的重要性，或者说，我想在这个干燥而可爱的早晨向你们建议。

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff.  

当然，像这样的演讲的主要要求是，我应该谈论你的文科教育的意义，试图解释为什么你即将获得的学位具有实际的人类价值，而不仅仅是物质回报。  

So let’s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about “teaching you how to think.” If you’re like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think.  

因此，让我们来谈谈毕业典礼演讲中最普遍的一个陈词滥调，那就是文科教育与其说是用知识来填充你，不如说是 "教你如何思考"。如果你像我一样是个学生，你从来都不喜欢听到这句话，你往往会觉得你需要别人教你如何思考的说法有点侮辱你，因为你甚至被一所这么好的大学录取这一事实似乎证明你已经知道如何思考。  

But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about.  

但我要向你提出，文科的陈词滥调原来根本不是侮辱性的，因为我们在这样的地方应该得到的真正重要的思维教育并不是真正的思考能力，而是选择思考什么。  

If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.  

如果你在思考问题方面的完全自由似乎太明显了，不能浪费时间讨论，我想请你想一想鱼和水，并把你对完全明显的价值的怀疑包围起来，就几分钟时间。

Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness.  

这里还有一个说教式的小故事。有两个人坐在一起，在偏远的阿拉斯加野外的一个酒吧里。  

One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer.  

其中一个人有宗教信仰，另一个人是无神论者，两个人正在争论上帝的存在，争论的力度特别大，大约在第四杯啤酒之后。  

And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing.  

无神论者说："听着，我并不是没有不相信上帝的实际理由。我也不是没有试验过上帝和祈祷的事情。  

Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled.  

就在上个月，我在那场可怕的暴风雪中远离了营地，我完全迷失了方向，什么都看不见，而且气温低至50度，于是我试了一下：我跪倒在雪地上，哭着说'哦，上帝，如果有上帝的话，我在这场暴风雪中迷路了，如果你不帮我，我就会死'"。而现在，在酒吧里，那个信教的人满脸疑惑地看着那个无神论者。

“Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes.

  

"那么你现在必须相信，"他说，"毕竟，你在这里，活着。"无神论者只是翻白眼。  

“No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”  

"不，伙计，那只是几个爱斯基摩人碰巧路过，给我指明了回营地的路。"

It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience.  

通过一种标准的文科分析来处理这个故事是很容易的：完全相同的经历对两个不同的人来说可能意味着两种完全不同的东西，因为这些人有两种不同的信仰模板和两种不同的从经验中构建意义的方式。  

Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad.  

因为我们崇尚宽容和信仰的多样性，在我们的文科分析中，没有任何地方要宣称一个人的解释是真的，另一个人的解释是假的或坏的。  

Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from.  

这很好，只是我们也从来没有最后讨论过这些个人的模板和信仰到底来自哪里。  

Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys.  

意思是，他们来自这两个人的内部。  

As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language.  

仿佛一个人对世界最基本的取向，以及他的经验的意义，就像身高或鞋码一样，都是硬性规定的；或者像语言一样，自动从文化中吸收的。  

As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance.  

仿佛我们如何构建意义实际上并不是一个个人的、有意的选择问题。此外，还有整个傲慢的问题。  

The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help.  

这个没有宗教信仰的人如此完全肯定地否定了路过的爱斯基摩人与他的求救有任何关系的可能性。  

True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too.  

的确，也有很多宗教人士看起来很傲慢，对自己的解释很肯定。  

They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us.  

他们可能比无神论者更令人厌恶，至少对我们大多数人来说是如此。  

But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up.  

但宗教教条主义者的问题与故事中的非信徒完全一样：盲目的确定性，一种封闭的心态，相当于一种完全的监禁，以至于犯人甚至不知道自己被关起来了。

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant.  

这里的重点是，我想这是教我如何思考的一部分，是真正应该的意思。要少一点傲慢。  

To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties.  

对自己和自己的确定性要有一点批判意识。  

Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded.  

因为有很大一部分我倾向于自动确定的东西，事实证明是完全错误的，是妄想。  

I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.  

我已经学到了这一点，我预测你们毕业生也会这样做。

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence.  

这里只是一个例子，说明我倾向于自动确定的东西是完全错误的：我自己眼前的一切经验都支持我的深刻信念，即我是宇宙的绝对中心；是存在的最真实、最生动、最重要的人。  

We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us.  

我们很少考虑这种自然的、基本的自我中心，因为它在社会上是如此令人厌恶。但这对我们所有人来说都是一样的。  

It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.  

这是我们的默认设置，一出生就被硬塞进我们的电路板。  

Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of.  

想一想：你所拥有的任何经验，都不是你的绝对中心。  

The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on.  

你所经历的世界就在你的前面或后面，在你的左边或右边，在你的电视或显示器上。以此类推。  

Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.  

别人的想法和感受必须以某种方式传达给你，但你自己的想法和感受是如此直接、迫切、真实。

Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue.  

请不要担心我准备给你讲慈悲心或其他导向性或所有所谓的美德。这不是美德的问题。  

It’s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self.  

这是我选择做的工作，以某种方式改变或摆脱我自然的、硬接线的默认设置，即深深地、实实在在地以自我为中心，并通过这个自我的镜头看待和解释一切。  

People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.  

能够以这种方式调整其自然默认设置的人经常被描述为 "适应良好"，我向你建议这不是一个偶然的术语。

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect.  

鉴于这里胜利的学术设置，一个明显的问题是，调整我们的默认设置的这项工作有多少涉及实际知识或智力。  

This question gets very tricky.  

这个问题变得非常棘手。  

Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education–least in my own case–is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.  

也许学术教育最危险的地方--至少在我自己的情况下--是它使我倾向于将东西过度智力化，迷失在我头脑中的抽象争论中，而不是简单地关注我面前发生的事情，关注我内心发生的事情。

As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now).  

我相信你们现在已经知道，要保持警觉和专注，而不是被自己脑海中不断的独白催眠（可能现在就在发生）是非常困难的。  

Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think.  

在我自己毕业20年后，我逐渐明白，关于教你如何思考的文科陈词滥调实际上是一个更深刻、更严肃的想法的速记：学习如何思考实际上意味着学习如何对你的思考方式和内容进行一些控制。  

It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.  

这意味着要有足够的意识和觉悟来选择你所关注的内容，并选择你如何从经验中构建意义。  

Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.  

因为如果你不能在成人生活中行使这种选择权，你就会完全陷入困境。  

Think of the old cliché about “the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.”  

想想那句老生常谈，"思想是一个优秀的仆人，但却是一个可怕的主人"。

This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth.  

这和许多陈词滥调一样，表面上如此蹩脚，毫无亮点，实际上表达了一个伟大而可怕的真理。  

It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master.  

用枪支自杀的成年人几乎总是向自己的头部开枪，这不是一点巧合。他们射击的是可怕的主人。  

And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.  

而事实是，这些自杀者中的大多数人在扣动扳机之前其实早就已经死亡。

And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out.  

我认为这才是你的文科教育真正的、没有废话的价值所在：如何避免在你舒适的、繁荣的、受人尊敬的成年生活中死气沉沉、毫无知觉，成为你的头脑和你的自然默认设置的奴隶，日复一日地独特地、完全地、强制性地孤独。  

That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let’s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what “day in day out” really means.  

这听起来可能是夸张的说法，或者是抽象的废话。让我们来具体谈谈。一个简单的事实是，你们这些即将毕业的学生还不知道 "日复一日 "的真正含义。  

There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration.  

在美国成年人的生活中，恰好有整整一大块地方没有人在毕业典礼的演讲中谈及。其中一个部分涉及无聊、常规和琐碎的挫折。  

The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.  

这里的父母和老人会很清楚我在说什么。

By way of example, let’s say it’s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you’re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again.  

举例来说，假设这是一个普通的成年人的一天，你早上起床，去做你的挑战性的白领、大学毕业生的工作，你努力工作了8或10个小时，在一天结束时，你很累，有些压力，你只想回家，吃一顿好的晚餐，也许放松一个小时，然后早点睡觉，因为，当然，你必须在第二天起床，再次做这一切。  

But then you remember there’s no food at home.  

但你又想起家里没有食物。  

You haven’t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket.  

这周你没有时间购物，因为你的工作很有挑战性，所以现在下班后你不得不坐上汽车，开车去超市。  

It’s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad.  

现在是工作日的尾声，交通很可能是：非常糟糕。  

So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it’s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping.  

因此，去商店的时间比它应该的要长，当你终于到了那里，超市非常拥挤，因为当然这是一天中所有其他有工作的人也试图挤出时间买些杂货的时候。  

And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it’s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can’t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store’s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren’t enough check-out lanes open even though it’s the end-of-the-day rush.  

商店里灯光昏暗，充斥着令人心碎的音乐或企业流行音乐，这几乎是你最不想去的地方，但你不能只是进去然后很快就出来；你不得不在巨大的、灯光过度的商店混乱的过道上徘徊，以找到你想要的东西，你不得不操纵你的垃圾车穿过所有其他疲惫的、匆忙的推车的人（等等，等等，把东西剪掉，因为这是一个漫长的仪式），最终你得到了所有的晚餐用品，只是现在发现没有足够的结账通道开放，尽管这是一天结束时的高峰。  

So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating.  

所以结账的队伍长的惊人，这很愚蠢，也很让人气愤。  

But you can’t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.  

但你不能把你的挫折感发泄在疯狂的收银员身上，她的工作过劳，每天的乏味和无意义超过了我们这所著名大学的任何人的想象力。

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line’s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to “Have a nice day” in a voice that is the absolute voice of death.  

但无论如何，你终于到了结账队伍的前面，你为你的食物付款，然后你被告知 "祝你今天愉快"，那声音绝对是死亡的声音。  

Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.  

然后，你必须把你那令人毛骨悚然、轻飘飘的塑料袋杂货装进你的手推车里，用一个疯狂的车轮疯狂地拉向左边，一路穿过拥挤、颠簸、乱七八糟的停车场，然后你必须通过缓慢、沉重、SUV密集、高峰期的交通一路开回家，等等等等。

Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn’t yet been part of you graduates’ actual life routine, day after week after month after year.  

当然，这里的每个人都做过这个。但它还没有成为你们这些毕业生实际生活常规的一部分，日复一日周复一月年复一年。

But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point.  

但这将是。除此之外还有许多沉闷的、令人讨厌的、似乎毫无意义的例行公事。但这并不是重点。  

The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in.  

关键是，像这样的小事，令人沮丧的废话，正是选择工作要来的地方。  

Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop.  

因为交通堵塞、拥挤的过道和长长的结账队伍给了我思考的时间，如果我不有意识地决定如何思考和注意什么，那么每次我不得不购物时，我都会很生气和痛苦。

Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me.

  

因为我的自然默认设置是确信像这样的情况确实都是关于我的。  

About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it’s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way.  

关于我的饥饿感和疲劳感，以及我对回家的渴望，在全世界看来，其他人都在挡我的路。  

And who are all these people in my way?  

而这些挡在我面前的人都是谁？  

And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line.  

再看看他们中的大多数人是多么令人厌恶，他们在收银台排队时显得多么愚蠢，像牛一样，眼睛死死地盯着，没有人性，或者看看人们在队伍中间大声讲手机是多么令人讨厌和粗鲁。  

And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.  

看看这是多么深刻和个人的不公平。

Or, of course, if I’m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV’s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest \[responding here to loud applause\] — this is an example of how NOT to think, though — most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers.  

或者，当然，如果我的默认设置是一个更有社会意识的文科形式，我可以花时间在一天结束的交通中，对所有巨大的、愚蠢的、堵塞车道的SUV和悍马以及V-12皮卡感到厌恶，燃烧他们浪费的、自私的、40加仑的汽油罐、我可以纠结于这样一个事实：爱国主义或宗教保险杠贴纸似乎总是贴在最大的、最令人厌恶的自私的车辆上，由最丑陋的人驾驶\[此处回应热烈的掌声\]--这是一个不应该思考的例子--最令人厌恶的自私的车辆，由最丑陋的、最不体谅人的、最具侵略性的司机驾驶。  

And I can think about how our children’s children will despise us for wasting all the future’s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.  

我可以想一想我们的孩子的孩子会如何鄙视我们，因为我们浪费了所有未来的燃料，而且可能破坏了气候，以及我们都是如何被宠坏的、愚蠢的、自私的和令人厌恶的，以及现代消费社会是如何糟糕的，等等等等。

You get the idea.  

你会明白的。

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn’t have to be a choice.  

如果我选择在商店和高速公路上这样想，很好。我们很多人都这样做。只是这种思考方式往往是如此简单和自动，以至于它不一定是一种选择。  

It is my natural default setting.  

这是我的自然默认设置。  

It’s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I’m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities.  

这是我体验成人生活中无聊、令人沮丧、拥挤的部分的自动方式，当我在自动、无意识地相信我是世界的中心时，我的直接需求和感受应该决定世界的优先次序。

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations.  

事情是这样的，当然，有完全不同的方式来思考这类情况。  

In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it’s not impossible that some of these people in SUV’s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive.  

在这种交通状况下，所有这些车辆都停在我的面前，这些开SUV的人中有的过去曾发生过可怕的汽车事故，现在觉得开车太可怕了，以至于他们的治疗师都命令他们买一辆巨大、沉重的SUV，这样他们才会觉得开车足够安全，这也不是不可能。  

Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he’s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he’s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.  

或者说，刚才截住我的那辆悍马车可能是由一位父亲驾驶的，他的小孩在他旁边的座位上受伤或生病了，他正试图把这个孩子送到医院，而他比我更急，更合理：实际上是我挡了他的路。

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket’s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.  

或者我可以选择强迫自己考虑这样一种可能性，即超市结账队伍中的其他人也和我一样感到无聊和沮丧，而且其中一些人的生活可能比我更艰难、更乏味和痛苦。

Again, please don’t think that I’m giving you moral advice, or that I’m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it.  

再次，请不要认为我在给你提供道德建议，或者我说你应该这样想，或者有人期望你自动就这样做。  

Because it’s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won’t be able to do it, or you just flat out won’t want to.  

因为这很难。它需要意志和努力，如果你像我一样，有些时候你会做不到，或者你根本就不想做。

But most days, if you’re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line.  

但在大多数日子里，如果你有足够的意识给自己一个选择，你可以选择以不同的眼光来看待这位刚刚在收银台对她的孩子大喊大叫的胖子、死人眼、过度化妆的女士。  

Maybe she’s not usually like this. Maybe she’s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer.  

也许她平时不是这样的。也许她已经连续三个晚上没有睡觉，握着一个因骨癌而死亡的丈夫的手。  

Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness.  

也可能这位女士就是机动车部门的低工资办事员，她昨天刚刚通过一些小的官僚主义的善意行为帮助你的配偶解决了一个可怕的、令人愤怒的红头文件问题。  

Of course, none of this is likely, but it’s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider.  

当然，这些都不可能，但也不是不可能。这只是取决于你想考虑什么。  

If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable.  

如果你自动确定你知道现实是什么，而且你在你的默认设置上操作，那么你和我一样，可能不会考虑那些不令人讨厌和痛苦的可能性。  

But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options.  

但是如果你真的学会了如何关注，那么你就会知道还有其他的选择。  

It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.  

它实际上将在你的能力范围内，体验到拥挤、炎热、缓慢、消费地狱式的情况，不仅是有意义的，而且是神圣的，与创造星星的力量相同：爱、友谊、所有事物深处的神秘一体性。

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try to see it.  

不是说那些神秘的东西一定是真的。唯一大写的 "真 "是，你可以决定你如何尝试去看它。

This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t.  

我认为，这就是真正的教育的自由，是学习如何适应的自由。你可以有意识地决定什么有意义，什么没有意义。  

You get to decide what to worship.  

你可以决定崇拜什么。

Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping.  

因为这里还有一些奇怪但真实的事情：在成人生活的日常战壕里，实际上没有无神论这回事。没有不敬拜的事情。  

Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.  

每个人都在敬拜。我们唯一的选择是敬拜什么。  

And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.  

也许选择某种神或精神类型的东西来崇拜的令人信服的理由--无论是JC还是安拉，无论是耶和华还是巫教的母神，还是四圣谛，还是一些不可侵犯的道德原则--是你崇拜的几乎所有其他东西都会把你活活吃掉。  

If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth.  

如果你崇拜金钱和事物，如果它们是你挖掘生命中真正意义的地方，那么你将永远不会有足够的东西，永远不会觉得你有足够的东西。这就是事实。  

Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly.  

崇拜你的身体、美貌和性的诱惑，你将永远感到丑陋。  

And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already.  

而当时间和年龄开始显现时，你会在他们最终为你悲伤之前死掉一百万次。在某种程度上，我们都已经知道这些东西。  

It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story.  

它已被编入神话、谚语、陈词滥调、箴言、寓言；每个伟大故事的骨架。  

The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.  

整个诀窍是在日常意识中保持真理的领先。

Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear.  

崇拜权力，你最终会感到软弱和恐惧，你将需要越来越多的对他人的权力来麻痹你自己的恐惧。  

Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.  

崇拜你的智力，被视为聪明，你最终会觉得自己很愚蠢，是个骗子，总是处于被发现的边缘。  

But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.  

但这些敬拜形式的阴险之处不是说它们邪恶或有罪，而是它们是无意识的。它们是默认设置。

They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing.  

他们是那种你逐渐滑入的崇拜，日复一日，对你看到的东西和你衡量价值的方式越来越有选择性，却从未完全意识到这是你正在做的。

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self.  

而所谓的现实世界不会阻止你按照你的默认设置进行操作，因为所谓的男人、金钱和权力的现实世界在恐惧、愤怒、沮丧、渴望和对自我的崇拜中欢快地哼唱。  

Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom.  

我们自己目前的文化已经利用了这些力量，产生了非凡的财富和舒适以及个人自由。  

The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation.  

自由是我们微小的头骨大小的王国的主宰，独自处于所有创造的中心。  

This kind of freedom has much to recommend it.  

这种自由有很多值得推荐之处。  

But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving….  

但当然也有各种不同的自由，而最珍贵的那种自由，你不会在外面的大世界里听到太多的谈论，希望和实现....。  

The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.  

真正重要的自由包括注意力、意识和纪律，以及能够真正关心其他人，每天以无数琐碎、不性感的方式为他们做出牺牲。

That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think.  

这就是真正的自由。这就是受教育，并了解如何思考。  

The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.  

另一种选择是无意识，是默认设置，是老鼠赛跑，是对曾经拥有和失去一些无限的东西的持续啃噬感。

I know that this stuff probably doesn’t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound.  

我知道，这些东西可能听起来并不像毕业典礼上的演讲那样有趣、轻松或宏大的鼓舞人心的。  

What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish.  

在我看来，它就是大写的 "真理"，去掉了一大堆修辞上的花哨。当然，你可以自由地认为它是你想要的。  

But please don’t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon.  

但是，请不要只是把它当作一些指手画脚的劳拉博士的说教。  

None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.  

这些东西其实都不是关于道德或宗教或教条或死后生命的大花哨问题。

The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.  

大写的真理是关于死亡之前的生命。

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:  

这是关于真正的教育的真正价值，它几乎与知识无关，而与简单的意识有关；意识到什么是如此真实和重要，如此隐藏在我们周围，一直以来，我们必须不断地提醒自己：

“This is water.” "这是水。"

“This is water.” "这是水。"

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out.  

要做到这一点，日复一日地在成人世界中保持意识和活力，是难以想象的。  

Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.  

这意味着另一个伟大的陈词滥调变成了现实：你的教育真的是一生的工作。而它的开始：现在。

I wish you way more than luck.  

我希望你的方式不仅仅是运气。

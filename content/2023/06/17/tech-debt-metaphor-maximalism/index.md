**Tech debt metaphor maximalism  

技术债务隐喻的最大化**

I really like the "tech debt" metaphor.  

我非常喜欢 "技术债务 "的比喻。  

A lot of people don't, but I think that's because they either don't extend the metaphor far enough, or because they don't properly understand financial debt.  

很多人不这么认为，但我认为这是因为他们要么没有把这个比喻延伸得足够远，要么是因为他们没有正确理解金融债务。

So let's talk about debt!  

因此，让我们来谈谈债务问题!

**Consumer debt vs capital investment  

消费者债务与资本投资**

Back in school my professor, [Canadian economics superhero Larry Smith](http://lwsmith.ca/), explained debt this way (paraphrased): debt is stupid if it's for instant gratification that you pay for later, with interest.  

在学校时，我的教授，加拿大经济学超级大师拉里-史密斯，是这样解释债务的（转述）：如果债务是为了即时的满足，你以后要用利息来偿还，那就是愚蠢的。  

But debt is great if it means you can make more money than the interest payments.  

但是，如果债务意味着你可以赚到比利息支出更多的钱，那就很好。

A family that takes on high-interest credit card debt for a visit to Disneyland is wasting money.  

一个家庭如果为了去迪士尼乐园游玩而承担高息信用卡债务，那就是在浪费钱。  

If you think you can pay it off in a year, you'll pay 20%-ish interest for that year for no reason.  

如果你认为你能在一年内还清，你将无缘无故地支付那一年的20%左右的利息。  

You can instead save up for a year and get the same gratification next year without the 20% surcharge.  

相反，你可以存一年的钱，明年得到同样的满足，而不需要20%的附加费。

But if you want to buy a $500k machine that will earn your factory an additional $1M/year in revenue, it would be foolish _not_ to buy it now, even with 20% interest ($100k/year). That's a profit of $900k in just the first year! (excluding depreciation)  

但如果你想买一台50万美元的机器，为你的工厂赚取额外的100万美元/年的收入，现在不买就太傻了，即使有20%的利息（10万美元/年）。这在第一年就能获得90万美元的利润!(不包括折旧)

There's a reason profitable companies with CFOs take on debt, and often the total debt increases rather than decreases over time.  

有盈利的长虹公司承担债务是有原因的，而且随着时间的推移，债务总额往往增加而不是减少。  

They're not idiots. They're making a rational choice that's win-win for everyone.  

他们不是傻子。他们正在做出一个理性的选择，对所有人都是双赢的。  

(The company earns more money faster, the banks earn interest, the interest gets paid out to consumers' deposit accounts.)  

(公司更快地赚取更多的钱，银行赚取利息，利息被支付给消费者的存款账户）。

Debt is bad when you take out the wrong kind, or you mismanage it, or it has weird strings attached (hello Venture Debt that requires you to put all your savings in [one underinsured place](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/15/svb-billions-uninsured-assets-companies/)). But done right, debt is a way to move faster instead of slower.  

如果你借错了，或者你管理不善，或者它有奇怪的附加条件（你好，风险债务要求你把所有的储蓄放在一个保险不足的地方），债务就不好。但如果处理得当，债务是一种更快而不是更慢的行动方式。

**High-interest vs low-interest debt  

高息与低息的债务**

For a consumer, the highest interest rates are for "store" credit cards, the kinds issued by Best Buy or Macy's or whatever that only work in that one store.  

对消费者来说，利率最高的是 "商店 "信用卡，即由百思买或梅西百货或其他公司发行的只在该商店使用的信用卡。  

They aren't as picky about risk (thus have more defaults) because it's the ultimate loyalty programme: it gets people to spend more at their store instead of other stores, in some cases because it's the only place that would issue those people debt in the first place.  

他们对风险不那么挑剔（因此有更多的违约），因为这是最终的忠诚度计划：它让人们在他们的商店而不是其他商店消费更多，在某些情况下，因为它是唯一会首先向这些人发债的地方。

The second-highest interest rate is on a general-purpose credit card like Visa or Mastercard.  

利率第二高的是普通用途的信用卡，如Visa或Mastercard。  

They can get away with high interest rates because they're also the payment system and so they're very convenient.  

他们可以摆脱高利率，因为他们也是支付系统，所以他们非常方便。

(Incidentally, when I looked at the stats a decade or so ago, in Canada credit cards make _most_ of their income on payment fees because Canadians are annoyingly persistent about paying off their cards; in the US it's the opposite.  

(顺便说一下，当我十几年前看统计数字时，在加拿大，信用卡的大部分收入来自于支付费用，因为加拿大人对还款的坚持令人讨厌；而在美国则相反。  

The rumours are true: Canadians really are more cautious about spending.)  

传言是真的：加拿大人真的对消费更加谨慎)。

If you have a good credit rating, you can get better interest rates on a bank-issued "line of credit" (LOC) (lower interest rate, but less convenient than a card).  

如果你有良好的信用评级，你可以通过银行发放的 "信用额度"（LOC）获得更好的利率（利率较低，但不如银行卡方便）。  

In Canada, one reason many people pay off their credit card each month is simply that they transfer the balance to a lower-interest LOC.  

在加拿大，许多人每月偿还信用卡的原因之一，仅仅是他们将余额转移到低利率的LOC。

Even lower interest rates can be obtained if you're willing to provide collateral: most obviously, the equity in your home.  

如果你愿意提供抵押品，甚至可以获得更低的利率：最明显的是你的房屋资产。  

This greatly reduces the risk for the lender because they can repossess and then resell your home if you don't pay up.  

这大大降低了贷款人的风险，因为如果你不还钱，他们可以收回，然后转卖你的房子。  

Which is pretty good for them even if you don't pay, but what's better is it makes you much more likely to pay rather than lose your home.  

即使你不付钱，这对他们来说也是相当好的，但更好的是它使你更有可能付钱而不是失去你的房子。

Some people argue that you should almost never plan to pay off your mortgage: typical mortgage interest rates are lower than the rates you'd get long-term from investing in the S&P.  

有些人认为，你几乎不应该计划偿还你的抵押贷款：典型的抵押贷款利率低于你从投资标准普尔指数中获得的长期利率。  

The advice that you should "always buy the biggest home you can afford" is often perversely accurate, especially if you believe property values will keep going up.  

你应该 "总是买你能负担得起的最大的房子 "的建议往往是反常的准确，特别是如果你相信房产价值会不断上升。  

And subject to your risk tolerance and lock-in preferences.  

并取决于你的风险承受能力和锁定的偏好。

What's the pattern here? Just this: high-interest debt is quick and convenient but you should pay it off quickly.  

这里的模式是什么？就这一点：高息债务是快速和方便的，但你应该迅速还清它。  

Sometimes you pay it off just by converting to longer-term lower-rate debt. Sometimes debt is collateralized and sometimes it isn't.  

有时你只是通过转换为较长期的低利率债务来偿还它。有时债务是有抵押的，有时没有。

**High-interest and low-interest tech debt  

高息和低息的科技债务**

Bringing that back to tech debt: a simple kind of high-interest short-term debt would be committing code without tests or documentation. Yay, it works, ship it!  

回到技术债务上：一种简单的高息短期债务是在没有测试或文档的情况下提交代码。是的，它的工作原理，发货吧!  

And truthfully, maybe you should, because the revenue (and customer feedback) you get from shipping fast can outweigh how much more bug-prone you made the code in the short term.  

说实话，也许你应该这样做，因为你从快速发货中得到的收入（和客户反馈）可以超过你在短期内使代码更容易出错的程度。

But like all high-interest debt, you should plan to pay it back fast.  

但就像所有的高息债务一样，你应该计划快速偿还它。  

Tech debt generally manifests as a slowdown in your development velocity (ie. overhead on everything else you do), which means fewer features launched in the medium-long term, which means less revenue and customer feedback.  

技术债务通常表现为你的开发速度放缓（即你所做的其他事情的开销），这意味着在中长期内推出的功能较少，这意味着收入和客户反馈较少。

Whoa, weird, right? This short-term high-interest debt both _increases_ revenue and feedback rate, and _decreases_ it. Why?  

哇，奇怪，对吗？这种短期高息债务既增加了收入和反馈率，又降低了反馈率。为什么呢？

-   If you take a single pull request (PR) that adds a new feature, and launch it without tests or documentation, you will definitely get the benefits of that PR sooner.  
    
    如果你采取一个增加新功能的单一拉动请求（PR），并在没有测试或文档的情况下启动它，你肯定会更快地获得该PR的好处。
    
-   Every PR you try to write after that, before adding the tests and docs (ie.  
    
    在这之后，在添加测试和文档之前，你尝试写的每一个PR（即  
    
    repaying the debt) will be slower because you risk creating undetected bugs or running into undocumented edge cases.  
    
    偿还债务）会更慢，因为你有可能创造出未被发现的错误或遇到未被记录的边缘案例。
    
-   If you take a long time to pay off the debt, the slowdown in future launches will outweigh the speedup from the first launch.  
    
    如果你需要很长的时间来偿还债务，那么未来发射的速度减慢将超过第一次发射的速度提升。
    

This is exactly how CFOs manage corporate financial debt.  

这正是首席财务官管理公司财务债务的方式。  

Debt is a drain on your revenues; the thing you did to incur the debt is a boost to your revenues; if you take too long to pay back the debt, it's an overall loss.  

债务是对你收入的一种消耗；你为债务所做的事情是对你收入的一种促进；如果你花了太长时间来偿还债务，那就是一种整体损失。

CFOs can calculate that. Engineers don't like to. (Partly because tech debt is less quantifiable.  

首席财务官可以计算出来。工程师却不喜欢这样做。(部分原因是技术债务较难量化。  

And partly because engineers are the sort of people who pay off their loans sooner than they mathematically should, as a matter of principle.)  

还有一部分原因是，工程师是那种在数学上应该尽早偿还贷款的人，这是一个原则问题）。

**Debt ceilings 债务最高限额**

The US government has imposed a [famously ill-advised debt ceiling](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-lifting-us-debt-limit-2023-06-03/) on itself, that mainly serves to cause drama and create a great place to push through unrelated riders that nobody will read, because the bill to raise the debt ceiling will always pass.  

美国政府给自己强加了一个著名的不明智的债务上限，这主要是为了制造戏剧性，并创造一个伟大的地方来推动没有人看的无关的附加条款，因为提高债务上限的法案总是会通过。

Real-life debt ceilings are defined by your creditworthiness: banks simply will not lend you more money if you've got so much outstanding debt that they don't believe you can handle the interest payments.  

现实生活中的债务上限是由你的信用度决定的：如果你的未偿债务太多，以至于银行不相信你能应付利息的支付，银行根本不会借给你更多的钱。  

That's your credit limit, or the largest mortgage they'll let you have.  

这是你的信用额度，或他们让你拥有的最大抵押贷款。

Banks take a systematic approach to calculating the debt ceiling for each client.  

银行采取系统的方法来计算每个客户的债务上限。  

How much can we lend you so that you take out the biggest loan you possibly can, thus paying as much interest as possible, without starving to death or (even worse) missing more than two consecutive payments?  

我们能借给你多少钱，让你尽可能地借出最大的贷款，从而支付尽可能多的利息，而不至于饿死或（更糟糕）连续错过两次以上的付款？  

Also, morbidly but honestly, since debts are generally not passed down to your descendants, they would like you to be able to just barely pay it all off (perhaps by selling off all your assets) right before you kick the bucket.  

另外，病态但诚实地讲，由于债务一般不会传给你的后代，他们希望你能在踢死之前勉强付清所有债务（也许是通过卖掉你的所有资产）。

They can math this, they're good at it. Remember, they don't want you to pay it off early. If you have leftover money you might use it to pay down your debt.  

他们能算出这个，他们很擅长这个。记住，他们不希望你提前还款。如果你有剩余的钱，你可以用它来偿还你的债务。  

That's no good, because less debt means lower interest payments. They'd rather you incur even more debt, then use that leftover monthly income even bigger interest payments.  

这不是好事，因为较少的债务意味着较低的利息支付。他们宁愿你产生更多的债务，然后用剩余的月收入来支付更大的利息。  

That's when you're trapped.  

这就是你被困住的时候。

The equivalent in tech debt is when you are so far behind that you can barely keep the system running with no improvements at all; the perfect balance.  

相当于技术债务的情况是，当你落后到完全没有改进的情况下，你可以勉强维持系统的运行；这就是完美的平衡。  

If things get worse over time, you're underwater and will eventually fail. But if you reach this zen state of perfect equilibrium, you can keep going forever, running in place.  

如果事情随着时间的推移变得更糟，你就会在水下，最终会失败。但如果你达到了这种完美平衡的禅定状态，你就可以永远坚持下去，在原地奔跑。  

That's your tech debt ceiling.  

这就是你的科技债务上限。

Unlike the banking world, I can't think of a way to anthropomorphize a villain who wants you to go that far into debt. Maybe the CEO?  

与银行界不同的是，我想不出有什么办法可以将一个想让你负债累累的恶棍拟人化。也许是CEO？  

I guess maybe someone who is trying to juice revenues for a well-timed acquisition. Private Equity firms also specialize in maximizing both financial and technical debt so they can extract the assets while your company slowly dies.  

我想，也许有人正试图为适时的收购增加收入。私募股权公司也擅长将财务和技术债务最大化，这样他们就可以在你的公司慢慢死去的时候提取资产。

Anyway, both in finance and tech, you want to stay well away from your credit limit.  

总之，无论在金融还是技术领域，你都希望远离你的信用限额。

**Debt to income ratios 债务与收入的比率**

There are many imperfect rules of thumb for how much debt is healthy. (Remember, some debt is very often healthy, and only people who don't understand debt rush to pay it all off as fast as they can.)  

对于多少债务是健康的，有许多不完美的经验法则。(记住，一些债务往往是健康的，只有那些不了解债务的人才会急于以最快的速度将其全部还清）。

One measure is the debt to income ratio (or for governments, the debt to GDP ratio). The problem with debt-to-income is debt and income are two different things.  

一个衡量标准是债务与收入的比率（或者对于政府来说，债务与GDP的比率）。债务收入比的问题是债务和收入是两码事。  

The first produces a mostly-predictable repayment cost spread over an undefined period of time; the other is a possibly-fast-changing benefit measured annually.  

前者产生一个大部分可预测的还款成本，分布在一个不确定的时间段内；另一个是一个可能快速变化的收益，按年计算。  

One is an amount, the other is a rate.  

一个是金额，另一个是比率。

It would be better to measure interest payments as a fraction of revenue. At least that encompasses the distinction between high-interest and low-interest loans.  

最好是以收入的一部分来衡量利息支付。至少这包含了高息和低息贷款之间的区别。  

And it compares two cashflow rates rather than the nonsense comparison of a balance sheet measure vs a cashflow measure.  

而且，它比较的是两个现金流率，而不是资产负债表计量与现金流计量的无稽之谈的比较。  

Banks love interest-to-income ratios; that's why your income level has such a big impact on your debt ceiling.  

银行喜欢利息收入比；这就是为什么你的收入水平对你的债务上限有如此大的影响。

In the tech world, the interest-to-income equivalent is how much time you spend dealing with overhead compared to building new revenue-generating features.  

在技术领域，利息与收入的对应关系是，与建立新的创收功能相比，你花多少时间来处理管理费用。  

Again, getting to zero overhead is probably not worth it. I like this [xkcd explanation](https://xkcd.com/1205/) of what is and is not worth the time:  

同样，要达到零开销可能不值得。我喜欢xkcd对什么是和什么是不值得的解释：

![](is_it_worth_the_time.png)

Tech debt, in its simplest form, is the time you didn't spend making tasks more efficient. When you think of it that way, it's obvious that zero tech debt is a silly choice.  

技术债务，以其最简单的形式，是你没有花时间使任务更有效率。当你这样想的时候，很明显，零技术债务是一个愚蠢的选择。

(Note that the interest-to-income ratio in this formulation has nothing to do with financial income.  

(请注意，这个表述中的利息收入比与财务收入无关）。  

"Tech income" in our metaphor is feature development time, where "tech debt" is what eats up your development time.)  

在我们的比喻中，"技术收入 "是指功能开发时间，而 "技术债务 "是指吞噬你的开发时间的东西）。

(Also note that by this definiton, nowadays tech stacks are so big, complex, and irritable that every project starts with a giant pile of someone else's tech debt on day 1. Enjoy!)  

(还要注意的是，按照这个定义，现在的技术栈是如此之大，如此之复杂，如此之易怒，以至于每个项目在第一天都是以一大堆别人的技术债务开始的。享受吧！)

**Debt to equity ratios 债务与股本的比率**

Interest-to-income ratios compare two items from your cashflow statement. Debt-to-equity ratios compare two items from your balance sheet.  

利息与收入比率比较现金流量表中的两个项目。债务与权益比率比较资产负债表中的两个项目。  

Which means they, too, are at least not nonsense.  

这意味着它们也至少不是无稽之谈。

"Equity" is unfortunately a lot fuzzier than income. How much is your company worth? Or your product?  

不幸的是，"股权 "比收入要模糊得多。你的公司值多少钱？或者你的产品？  

The potential value of a factory isn't just the value of the machines inside it; it's the amortized income stream you (or a buyer) could get from continuing to operate that factory.  

一家工厂的潜在价值不仅仅是里面的机器的价值；它是你（或买家）继续经营这家工厂所能得到的摊销后的收入流。

Which means it includes the built-up human and business expertise needed to operate the factory.

  

这意味着它包括运营工厂所需的积累的人力和商业专业知识。

And of course, software is even worse; as many of us know but few businesspeople admit, the value of proprietary software without the people is zero.  

当然，软件就更糟糕了；我们很多人都知道，但很少有商业人士承认，没有人的专利软件的价值是零。  

This is why you hear about acqui-hires (humans create value even if they might quit tomorrow) but never about acqui-codes (code without humans is worthless).  

这就是为什么你听到的是 "熟人"（人类创造价值，即使他们明天可能辞职），但从来没有听说过 "熟人 "代码（没有人类的代码是没有价值的）。

Anyway, for a software company the "equity" comes from a variety of factors. In the startup world, Venture Capitalists are -- and I know this is depressing -- the best we have for valuing company equity.  

总之，对于一个软件公司来说，"股权 "来自于各种因素。在创业公司的世界里，风险资本家是--我知道这很令人沮丧--我们对公司股权进行估值的最佳人选。  

They are, of course, not very good at it, but they make it up in volume.  

当然，他们在这方面并不擅长，但他们在数量上弥补了这一点。  

As software companies get more mature, valuation becomes more quantifiable and comes back to expectations for the future cashflow statement.  

随着软件公司越来越成熟，估值变得更加量化，并回归到对未来现金流报表的预期。

Venture Debt is typically weighted heavily on equity (expected future value) and somewhat less on revenue (ability to pay the interest).  

风险投资债务通常在股权（预期的未来价值）上占很大比重，而在收入（支付利息的能力）上占较小比重。

As the company builds up assets and shows faster growth, the assumed equity value gets bigger and bigger. In the financial world, that means people are willing to issue more debt.  

随着公司建立起资产并显示出更快的增长，假定的股权价值就会越来越大。在金融界，这意味着人们愿意发行更多的债务。

(Over in the consumer world: your home is equity. That's why you can get a huge mortgage on a house but your unsecured loan limit is much smaller.  

(在消费者的世界里：你的房子就是资产。这就是为什么你可以在房子上获得巨额抵押贷款，但你的无担保贷款限额却小得多。  

So Venture Debt is like a mortgage.)  

所以风险债务就像抵押贷款）。

Anyway, back to tech debt: the debt-to-equity ratio is how much tech debt you've taken on compared to the accumulated value, and future growth rate, of your product quality.  

总之，回到技术债务：债务与资产比率是指与你的产品质量的累积价值和未来增长率相比，你已经承担了多少技术债务。  

If your product is acquiring lots of customers fast, you can afford to take on more tech debt so you can acquire more customers even faster.  

如果你的产品能快速获得大量客户，你就有能力承担更多的技术债务，这样你就能更快地获得更多客户。

What's weirder is that as the absolute value of product equity increases, you can take on a larger and larger absolute value of tech debt.  

更奇怪的是，随着产品权益绝对值的增加，你可以承担越来越大的技术债务绝对值。

That feels unexpected. If we're doing so well, why would we want to take on _more_ tech debt? But think of it this way: if your product (thus company) are really growing that fast, you will have more people to pay down the tech debt next year than you do now.  

这感觉出乎意料。如果我们做得这么好，我们为什么要承担更多的技术债务？但是，请这样想：如果你的产品（也就是公司）真的发展得那么快，明年你就会有比现在更多的人去偿还技术债务。  

In theory, you could even take on so much tech debt this year that your current team can't even pay the interest...  

在理论上，你甚至可以在今年承担如此多的技术债务，以至于你目前的团队甚至无法支付利息......

...which brings us to leverage. And risk.  

...这让我们看到了杠杆作用。还有风险。

**Leverage risk 杠杆风险**

Earlier in this article, I mentioned the popular (and surprisingly, often correct!) idea that you should "buy the biggest house you can afford." Why would I want a bigger house?  

在这篇文章的前面，我提到了一个流行的（而且令人惊讶的是，往往是正确的！）想法，即你应该 "买你能负担得起的最大的房子"。我为什么要买一个更大的房子？  

My house is fine. I have a big enough house. How is this good advice?  

我的房子很好。我有一个足够大的房子。这怎么是好建议？

The answer is the amazing multiplying power of leverage.  

答案是杠杆的惊人倍增力量。

Let's say housing goes up at 5%/year. (I wish it didn't because this rate is fabulously unsustainable.  

假设住房以5%/年的速度上涨。(我希望它不涨，因为这个比率是非常不可持续的。  

But bear with me.) And let's say you have $100k in savings and $100k in annual income.  

但请忍耐一下）。假设你有10万美元的储蓄和10万美元的年收入。

You could pay cash and buy a house for $100k. Woo hoo, no mortgage! And it'll go up in value by about $5k/year, which is not bad I guess.  

你可以支付现金，以10万美元的价格买下一栋房子。呜呼，没有抵押贷款!而且它的价值每年会上升大约5千美元，我想这还不错。

Or, you could buy a $200k house: a $100k down payment and a $100k mortgage at, say, 3% (fairly common back in 2021), which means $3k/year in interest.  

或者，你可以买一个20万美元的房子：10万美元的首付和10万美元的抵押贷款，例如，3%（在2021年相当普遍），这意味着3千美元/年的利息。  

But your $200k house goes up by 5% = $10k/year. Now you have an annual gain of $10k - $3k = $7k, much more than the $5k you were making before, with the same money. Sweet!  

但是你的20万美元的房子上涨了5%=1万美元/年。现在你的年收益为1万-3万=7万，比你之前用同样的钱赚的5万多得多。真好!

But don't stop there. If the bank will let you get away with it, why not a $1M house with a $100k down payment?  

但不要止步于此。如果银行允许你这样做，为什么不可以用10万美元的首付购买100万美元的房子？  

That's $1M x 5% = +$50k/year in value, and $900k x 3% = $27k in interest, so a solid $23k in annual (unrealized) capital gain. From the same initial bank balance!  

这就是100万美元×5%=+5万美元/年的价值，以及90万美元×3%=2.7万美元的利息，所以每年有2.3万美元的（未实现的）资本收益。从相同的初始银行余额中  

Omg we're printing money.  

我们正在印钱。

(Obviously we're omitting maintenance costs and property tax here. Forgive me.  

(显然，我们在这里省略了维护费用和房产税。请原谅我。  

On the other hand, presumably you're getting intangible value from living in a much bigger and fancier house.  

另一方面，想必你从住在一个更大更豪华的房子里得到了无形的价值。  

$AAPL shares don't have skylights and rumpus rooms and that weird statue in bedroom number seven.)  

AAPL的股票没有天窗和娱乐室，也没有七号卧室的那个奇怪的雕像。）

What's the catch? Well, the catch is massively increasing risk.  

有什么问题吗？嗯，陷阱是大量增加的风险。

Let's say you lose your job and can't afford interest payments. If you bought your $100k house with no mortgage, you're in luck: that house is yours, free and clear.  

假设你失去了工作，无力支付利息。如果你买的10万美元的房子没有抵押贷款，你就很幸运了：那房子是你的，自由而清晰。  

You might not have food but you have a place to live.  

你可能没有食物，但你有一个地方可以住。

If you bought the $1M house and have $900k worth of mortgage payments to keep up, you're screwed.  

如果你买了100万美元的房子，有90万美元的按揭付款要跟上，你就完蛋了。  

Get another job or get ready to move out and disrupt your family and change everything about your standard of living, up to and possibly including bankruptcy, which we'll get to in a bit.  

找另一份工作，或者准备搬出去，打乱你的家庭，改变你生活标准的一切，直到并可能包括破产，这一点我们稍后会提到。

Similarly, let's imagine that your property value stops increasing, or (less common in the US for stupid reasons, but common everywhere else) mortage rates go up.  

同样，让我们想象一下，你的财产价值停止增长，或者（在美国由于愚蠢的原因不太常见，但在其他地方很常见）抵押贷款利率上升。  

The leverage effect multiplies your potential losses just like it multiplies your potential gains.  

杠杆效应使你的潜在损失倍增，就像它使你的潜在收益倍增一样。

Back to tech debt. What's the analogy?  

回到科技债务。该怎么比喻呢？

Remember that idea I had above, of incurring extra tech debt this year to keep the revenue growth rolling, and then planning to pay it off next year with the newer and bigger team?  

还记得我上面的那个想法吗？今年产生额外的技术债务以保持收入增长，然后计划在明年用更新更大的团队将其还清。  

Yeah, that actually works... if you keep growing. If you estimated your tech debt interest rate correctly. If that future team materializes.  

是的，这实际上是可行的......如果你保持增长。如果你正确估计了你的技术债务利率。如果那个未来的团队实现了。  

(If you can even motivate that future team to work on tech debt.) If you're rational, next year, about whether you borrow more or not.  

(如果你甚至能激励那个未来的团队为技术债务而努力。) 如果你是理性的，明年，关于你是否借更多的钱。

That thing I said about the perfect equilibrium running-in-place state, when you spend all your time just keeping the machine operating and you have no time to make it better.  

我说的那个关于完美平衡的原地运行状态的事情，当你把所有的时间都花在维持机器的运行上，你没有时间让它变得更好。  

How do so many companies get themselves into that state? In a word, leverage. They guessed wrong.  

这么多的公司是如何让自己进入这种状态的呢？一句话，杠杆。他们猜错了。  

The growth rate fell off, the new team members didn't materialize or didn't ramp up fast enough.  

增长速度下降，新的团队成员没有实现，或者没有足够快地提升。

And if you go past equilibrium, you get the worst case: your tech debt interest is greater than your tech production (income).  

而如果你过了平衡期，你会得到最坏的情况：你的科技债务利息大于你的科技生产（收入）。  

Things get worse and worse and you enter the downward spiral. This is where desperation sets in. The only remaining option is ~bankruptcy~ Tech Debt Refinancing.  

事情变得越来越糟，你进入了下滑的漩涡。这时就会出现绝望。剩下的唯一选择是破产技术债务再融资。

**Refinancing 再融资**

Most people who can't afford the interest on their loans don't declare bankruptcy.  

大多数无力承担贷款利息的人不会宣布破产。  

The step before that is to make an arrangement with your creditors to lower your interest payments. Why would they accept such an agreement?  

在此之前的步骤是与你的债权人做出安排，降低你的利息支付。为什么他们会接受这样的协议？  

Because if they don't, you'll declare bankruptcy, which is annoying for you but hugely unprofitable for them.  

因为如果他们不这样做，你就会宣布破产，这对你来说很恼火，但对他们来说却大大无利可图。

The tech metaphor for refinancing is _premature deprecation_. Yes, people love both service A and service B. Yes, we are even running both services at financial breakeven.  

再融资的技术隐喻是过早折旧。是的，人们同时喜欢服务A和服务B。是的，我们甚至在财务收支平衡的情况下运行这两项服务。  

But they are slipping, slipping, getting a little worse every month and digging into a hole that I can't escape.  

但是他们正在滑落，滑落，每个月都会变得更糟糕一些，并且挖到了一个我无法逃脱的洞。  

In order to pull out of this, I have to stop my payments on A so I can pay back more of B; by then A will be unrecoverably broken.  

为了抽身而出，我必须停止对A的支付，以便我能够偿还更多的B；到那时，A将无法挽回了。  

But at least B will live on, to fight another day.  

但至少B将继续活着，再战一天。

Companies do this all the time. Even at huge profitable companies, in some corners you'll occasionally find an understaffed project sliding deeper and deeper into tech debt.  

公司一直在这样做。即使在巨大的盈利公司，在一些角落里，你偶尔会发现一个人手不足的项目在技术债务上越滑越深。  

Users may still love it, and it may even be net profitable, but not profitable enough to pay for the additional engineering time to dig it out.  

用户可能仍然喜欢它，它甚至可能是净盈利的，但盈利能力不足以支付额外的工程时间来挖掘它。  

Such a project is destined to die, and the only question is when. The answer is "whenever some executive finally notices."  

这样的项目注定会死亡，唯一的问题是何时。答案是 "每当某个主管最终注意到时"。

**Bankruptcy 破产**

The tech bankruptcy metaphor is an easy one: if refinancing doesn't work and your tech debt continues to spiral downward, sooner or later your finances will follow.  

科技破产的比喻很简单：如果再融资不起作用，你的科技债务继续螺旋式下降，你的财务状况迟早会跟着下降。  

When you run out of money you declare bankruptcy; what's interesting is your tech debt disappears at the same time your financial debt does.  

当你用完了钱，你就宣布破产；有趣的是你的技术债务在你的财务债务消失的同时也消失了。

This is a really important point. You can incur all the tech debt in the world, and while your company is still operating, you at least have some chance of someday paying it back.  

这是一个非常重要的观点。你可以承担世界上所有的技术债务，当你的公司仍在运营时，你至少有一些机会在某一天偿还它。  

When your company finally dies, you will find yourself off the hook; the tech debt never needs to be repaid.  

当你的公司最终死亡时，你会发现自己已经脱身；技术债务永远不需要偿还。

Okay, for those of us grinding away at code all day, perhaps that sounds perversely refreshing. But it explains lots of corporate behaviour.  

好吧，对于我们这些整天磨着代码的人来说，也许这听起来是反常的新鲜。但它解释了很多企业行为。  

The more desperate a company gets, the less they care about tech debt. _Anything_ to turn a profit. They're not wrong to do so, but you can see how the downward spiral begins to spiral downward.  

一个公司越是绝望，他们就越不关心技术债务。只要能实现盈利就可以了。他们这样做没有错，但你可以看到下滑的趋势是如何开始螺旋式下降的。  

The more tech debt you incur, the slower your development goes, and the harder it is to do something productive that might make you profitable. You might still pull it off!  

你的技术债务越多，你的发展就越慢，就越难做一些可能使你盈利的有价值的事情。你还是会成功的!  

But your luck will get progressively worse.  

但你的运气会逐渐变差。

The reverse is also true. When your company is doing well, you have time to pay back tech debt, or at least to control precisely how much debt you take on and when.  

反过来也是如此。当你的公司经营良好时，你有时间来偿还技术债务，或者至少可以精确地控制你承担多少债务和何时承担。  

To maintain your interest-to-income ratio or debt-to-equity ratio at a reasonable level.  

将你的利息收入比或债务资产比保持在合理的水平。

When you see a company managing their tech debt carefully, you see a company that is planning for the long term rather than a quick exit.  

当你看到一家公司谨慎地管理他们的科技债务时，你看到的是一家为长期规划而不是快速退出的公司。  

Again, that doesn't mean paying it all back. It means being careful.  

同样，这并不意味着要把钱全部还清。它意味着要小心。

**Student loans that are non-dischargeable in bankruptcy  

在破产中不可撤销的学生贷款**

Since we're here anyway talking about finance, let's talk about the idiotic US government policy of guaranteeing student loans, but also not allowing people to discharge those loans (ie.  

既然我们在这里讨论金融问题，让我们谈谈美国政府为学生贷款提供担保的白痴政策，但也不允许人们解除这些贷款（即。  

zero them out) in bankruptcy.  

归零）的破产。

What's the effect of this? Well, of course, banks are extremely eager to give these loans out to anybody, at any scale, as fast as they can, because they can't lose.  

这有什么影响？嗯，当然，银行极其渴望以最快的速度向任何人发放这些贷款，无论规模大小，因为他们不能输。  

They have all the equity of the US government to back them up. The debt-to-equity ratio is effectively zero.  

他们有美国政府的所有股权作为后盾。债务与权益的比率实际上是零。

And of course, people who don't understand finance (which they don't teach you until university; catch-22!) take on lots of these loans in the hope of making money in the future.  

当然，那些不懂金融的人（他们在大学里才会教你；catch-22！）承担了很多这样的贷款，希望将来能赚到钱。

Since anyone who wants to go to university can get a student loan, American universities keep raising their rates until they find the maximum amount that lenders are willing to lend (unlimited!) or foolish borrowers are willing to borrow in the name of the American Dream (so far we haven't found the limit).  

由于任何想上大学的人都可以获得学生贷款，美国大学不断提高利率，直到他们找到贷款人愿意借出的最大金额（无限！）或愚蠢的借款人愿意以美国梦的名义借贷（到目前为止，我们还没有找到极限）。

Where was I? Oh right, tech metaphors.  

我说到哪里了？哦，对了，技术隐喻。

Well, there are two parts here. First, unlimited access to money. Well, the tech world has had plenty of that, prior to the 2022 crash anyway.  

嗯，这里有两个部分。首先，无限制地获得资金。好吧，科技界有很多这样的机会，反正在2022年的崩溃之前。  

The result is they hired way too many engineers (students) who did a lot of dumb stuff (going to school) and incurred a lot of tech debt (student loans) that they promised to pay back later when their team got bigger (they earned their Bachelor's degree and got a job), which unfortunately didn't materialize. Oops.  

其结果是他们雇用了太多的工程师（学生），他们做了很多愚蠢的事情（上学），并产生了大量的技术债务（学生贷款），他们承诺以后当他们的团队变大时（他们获得了学士学位并找到了工作）会偿还这些债务，不幸的是这并没有实现。哎呀。  

They are worse off than if they had skipped all that.  

他们的情况比跳过这一切更糟糕。

Second, inability to discharge the debt in bankruptcy. Okay, you got me. Maybe we've come to the end of our analogy.  

第二，无力在破产中解除债务。好吧，你明白我的意思。也许我们已经走到了比喻的尽头。  

Maybe US government policies actually, and this is quite an achievement, manage to be even dumber than tech company management. In this one way. Maybe.  

也许美国政府的政策实际上，这是一个相当大的成就，设法比科技公司的管理层更加愚蠢。在这个方面。也许。

OR MAYBE YOU [OPEN SOURCED WVDIAL](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20091224) AND PEOPLE STILL EMAIL YOU FOR HELP DECADES AFTER YOUR FIRST STARTUP IS LONG GONE.  

或者是你开放了wvdial的源代码，在你第一次创业的几十年后，人们仍然给你发电子邮件寻求帮助。

Um, sorry for that outburst. I have no idea where that came from.  

嗯，很抱歉，我的爆发。我不知道那是怎么来的。

**Bonus note: bug bankruptcy  

奖金说明：虫子破产**

While we're here exploring financial metaphors, I might as well say something about bug bankruptcy. Although I [have been known to make fun of bug bankruptcy](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213), it too is an excellent metaphor, but only if you take it far enough.  

当我们在这里探讨金融隐喻的时候，我不妨说说关于虫子破产的事情。虽然我一直以嘲笑虫子破产而闻名，但它也是一个很好的隐喻，但只有当你把它看得足够远。

For those who haven't heard of this concept, bug bankruptcy happens when your bug tracking database is so full of bugs that you give up and delete them all and start over ("declare bankruptcy").  

对于那些没有听说过这个概念的人来说，当你的错误跟踪数据库中充满了错误，以至于你放弃了，把它们全部删除并重新开始（"宣布破产"）时，错误破产就发生了。

Like financial bankruptcy, it is very tempting: I have this big pile of bills. Gosh, it is a big pile. Downright daunting, if we're honest.  

就像财务破产一样，它是非常诱人的：我有这一大堆的账单。天哪，它是一大堆。如果我们说实话，简直令人生畏。  

Chances are, if I opened all these bills, I would find out that I owe more money than I have, and moreover, next month a bunch more bills will come and I won't be able to pay them either and this is hopeless.  

有可能，如果我打开所有这些账单，我就会发现我欠的钱比我的多，此外，下个月还会有一堆账单来，我也无法支付它们，这就没希望了。  

That would be stressful.  

这将是一种压力。  

My solution, therefore, is to throw all the bills in the dumpster, call up my friendly neighbourhood bankruptcy trustee, and conveniently discharge all my debt once and for all.  

因此，我的解决办法是把所有的账单扔进垃圾箱，打电话给我友好的邻居破产托管人，方便地一劳永逸地解除我的所有债务。

Right? 对吗？

Well, not so fast, buddy. Bankruptcy has consequences. First of all, it's kind of annoying to arrange legally.  

嗯，没那么快，伙计。破产是有后果的。首先，在法律上的安排是有点烦人的。  

Secondly, it sits on your financial records for like 7 years afterwards, during which time probably nobody will be willing to issue you any loans, because you're empirically the kind of person who does not pay back their loans.  

其次，它在你的财务记录上停留了7年之久，在此期间可能没有人愿意向你发放任何贷款，因为根据经验，你是那种不偿还贷款的人。

And that, my friends, is also how bug bankruptcy works. Although the process for declaring it is easier -- no lawyers or trustees required!  

而这，我的朋友们，也是虫子破产的方式。虽然宣布破产的过程更容易--不需要律师或受托人！但是，这也是一个很好的例子！  

\-- the long-term destruction of trust is real. If you run a project in which a lot of people spent a bunch of effort filing and investigating bugs (ie.  

\--对信任的长期破坏是真实的。如果你运行一个项目，其中有很多人花了大量精力来归档和调查错误（即。  

lent you their time in the hope that you'll pay it back by fixing the bugs later), and you just close them all wholesale, you can expect that those people will eventually stop filing bugs.  

如果你把他们的时间借给你，希望你以后能通过修复bug来回报他们），而你只是把它们全部关闭，你可以预期这些人最终会停止提交bug。  

Which, you know, admittedly feels better, just like the hydro company not sending you bills anymore feels better until winter comes and your heater doesn't work and you can't figure out why and you eventually remember "oh, I think someone said this might happen but I forget the details."  

这一点，你知道，承认感觉更好，就像水电公司不再给你寄账单感觉更好，直到冬天到来，你的暖气不工作，你无法找出原因，你最终记得 "哦，我想有人说这可能发生，但我忘了细节。"

Anyway, yes, you can do it. But refinancing is better.  

总之，是的，你可以这样做。但再融资是更好的。

**Email bankruptcy 电子邮件破产**

Email bankruptcy is similar to bug bankruptcy, with one important distinction: nobody ever expected you to answer your email anyway.  

电子邮件破产与窃听器破产类似，但有一个重要的区别：反正没有人指望你会回答你的电子邮件。  

I'm honestly not sure why people keep sending them.  

老实说，我不知道为什么人们一直在发送它们。

ESPECIALLY EMAILS ABOUT WVDIAL where does that voice keep coming from  

特别是关于WVDIAL的邮件，那声音是怎么来的？

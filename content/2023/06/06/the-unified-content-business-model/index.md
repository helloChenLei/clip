- 在媒体领域，订阅模式和广告模式的选择一直是个争议。BuzzFeed在新闻领域的赌注没有成功，而The Athletic被纽约时报收购，后者的重点是增加广告。
- 出版商需要寻找可持续的商业模式，而不是仅仅专注于内容生产。在内容实体中，要明确自己是利基企业还是规模化企业，并根据所选择的商业模式进行新闻报道。
- 三个成功案例是纽约时报、YouTube和Netflix。纽约时报在订阅和广告模式上都取得了成功，YouTube成功地同时采用了广告和付费订阅模式，而Netflix则完全依靠订阅模式。
- 出版商需要从过去的错误中吸取教训，同时注重商业模式和新闻报道之间的协调，以及适应不同的用户需求。

这些案例表明，内容业务最好采用“两者兼顾”的商业模式，即既有订阅也有广告。

In 2017 [BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti declared](https://www.wsj.com/video/jonah-peretti-at-dlive-full-interview/2DC79F42-A5F2-475B-84A2-EB1CC0085CC0.html) that “if you’re thinking about an electorate and you’re thinking about the public and you’re thinking about people being informed, the subscription model in media does not help inform the broad public”; in 2017 The Athletic CEO Alex Mather went in the opposite direction, telling me in a [Stratechery Interview](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-athletic-expands-an-interview-with-the-athletic-ceo-alex-mather/) that his publication would be differentiated by “less clickbait, no ads, no game recaps, no hot takes, really focusing in on the deeper stories, the insider stuff, the minutiae for the really diehard fan.”  

2017 年，BuzzFeed 首席执行官乔纳·佩雷蒂 (Jonah Peretti) 宣称，“如果你考虑的是选民，你考虑的是公众，你考虑的是人们被告知的情况，那么媒体的订阅模式无助于告知广大公众”； 2017 年，The Athletic 首席执行官亚历克斯马瑟 (Alex Mather) 采取了相反的方向，在一次 Stratechery 采访中告诉我，他的出版物将通过“更少的点击诱饵、没有广告、没有比赛重述、没有热门镜头，真正专注于更深层次的故事，内幕消息，为真正的铁杆粉丝准备的细枝末节。”

Today in 2023 [BuzzFeed has shuttered its News team](https://stratechery.com/2023/buzzfeed-shutters-news-startups-and-the-rd-tax-credit/) and [The Athletic has been acquired by the New York Times](https://stratechery.com/2022/take-two-acquires-zynga-the-new-york-times-buys-the-athletic/); the latter’s top priority was [adding advertising](https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2022/the-athletic-advertisements-new-york-times-reader-response/).  

2023 年的今天，BuzzFeed 关闭了其新闻团队，The Athletic 已被纽约时报收购；后者的首要任务是增加广告。

BuzzFeed’s bet on news was a bet on Facebook and Google’s willingness to subsidize free news, a bet that didn’t pay off.  

BuzzFeed 对新闻的赌注是对 Facebook 和谷歌愿意补贴免费新闻的赌注，但没有得到回报。  

The Athletic had a happier ending, even if there are arguments that the New York Times overpaid, given that the sports publication had never made a profit; it’s also the case that neither BuzzFeed News nor The Athletic were running the proper business model for content on the Internet.  

The Athletic 有一个更幸福的结局，尽管有人认为《纽约时报》付出了过高的代价，因为这家体育刊物从未盈利过； BuzzFeed News 和 The Athletic 都没有为 Internet 上的内容运行正确的商业模式。  

The question going forward should not be advertising or subscriptions; the answer, in meme form:  

未来的问题不应该是广告或订阅；答案，以模因形式：

!["Why not both?" meme](unifiedcontent-1.png)

This is, of course, a return to form for content production; it’s also both an evolution and refutation of a point I argued in 2015’s [Popping the Publishing Bubble](https://stratechery.com/2015/popping-the-publishing-bubble/):  

当然，这是内容生产形式的回归；这也是我在 2015 年的 Popping the Publishing Bubble 中论证的观点的演变和反驳：

> It is easy to feel sorry for publishers: before the Internet most were swimming in money, and for the first few years online it looked like online publications with lower costs of production would be profitable as well.  
> 
> 出版商很容易感到难过：在互联网出现之前，大多数人都在赚钱，而在最初的几年里，生产成本较低的在线出版物似乎也能盈利。  
> 
> The problem, though, was the assumption that advertising money would always be there, resulting in a “build it and they will come” mentality that focused almost exclusively on content production and far too little on sustainable business models.  
> 
> 然而，问题在于广告资金永远存在的假设，导致了一种“建立它，他们就会来”的心态，这种心态几乎完全专注于内容制作，而对可持续商业模式的关注太少。
> 
> In fact, publishers going forward need to have the exact opposite attitude from publishers in the past: instead of focusing on journalism and getting the business model for free, publishers need to start with a sustainable business model and focus on journalism that works hand-in-hand with the business model they have chosen.  
> 
> 事实上，未来的出版商需要与过去的出版商持完全相反的态度：与其专注于新闻业并免费获得商业模式，出版商需要从可持续的商业模式开始，并专注于携手合作的新闻业- 掌握他们选择的商业模式。  
> 
> First and foremost that means publishers need to answer the most fundamental question required of any enterprise: are they a niche or scale business?  
> 
> 首先也是最重要的是，这意味着出版商需要回答任何企业都需要回答的最基本的问题：他们是小众企业还是规模企业？
> 
> -   Niche businesses make money by maximizing revenue per user on a (relatively) small user base  
>     
>     利基企业通过在（相对）小的用户群上最大化每个用户的收入来赚钱
> -   Scale businesses make money by maximizing the number of users they reach  
>     
>     规模化企业通过最大化他们所覆盖的用户数量来赚钱
> 
> The truth is most publications are trying to do a little bit of everything: gain more revenue per user here, reach more users over there.  
> 
> 事实上，大多数出版物都试图在所有方面都做一点点：在这里从每个用户那里获得更多收入，在那里吸引更多用户。  
> 
> However, unless you’re the New York Times (and even then it’s questionable), trying to do everything is a recipe for failing at everything; these two strategies require different revenue models, different journalistic focuses, and even different presentation styles.  
> 
> 然而，除非你是《纽约时报》（即使那样也是有问题的），否则尝试做所有事情都是失败的秘诀；这两种策略需要不同的收入模式、不同的新闻关注点，甚至不同的呈现方式。

I think my position today is more of an evolution than a refutation, because I do still think it is essential for an content entity to understand if it is in the niche or scale game; the refutation is twofold: first, [everything is a niche](https://stratechery.com/2020/never-ending-niches/), and second, nearly all content businesses should have both subscriptions and advertising.  

我认为我今天的立场更像是一种进化而不是反驳，因为我仍然认为内容实体必须了解它是在利基游戏中还是在规模游戏中；反驳是双重的：首先，一切都是利基市场，其次，几乎所有的内容业务都应该有订阅和广告。

### Three Success Stories 三个成功案例

Three companies have helped convince me that “both” is the best business model for content businesses.  

三家公司帮助我相信“两者”是内容业务的最佳商业模式。

**New York Times:** I shouldn’t have been so quick in that 2015 Article to dismiss the New York Times: [last year](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/03/The-New-York-Times-Company-2022-Annual-Report.pdf) the company had $2.3 billion in revenue; $1.6 billion from subscriptions, and $523 million from advertising (the rest was from “Other”, including licensing, affiliate referrals, live events, etc.).  

纽约时报：我不应该在 2015 年的那篇文章中如此迅速地驳斥纽约时报：去年该公司的收入为 23 亿美元； 16 亿美元来自订阅，5.23 亿美元来自广告（其余来自“其他”，包括许可、联盟推荐、现场活动等）。  

Moreover, the advertising business, at least according to New York Times CEO Meredith Kopit Levien, is compelling precisely because it’s attached to a subscription business; from a [Stratechery Interview](https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-the-new-york-times-company-ceo-meredith-kopit-levien/#adsaudio):  

此外，至少根据《纽约时报》首席执行官梅雷迪思·科皮特·莱维恩 (Meredith Kopit Levien) 的说法，广告业务之所以引人注目，恰恰是因为它与订阅业务相关联；来自Stratechery采访：

> We have painstakingly built an ad business that we as a growing subscription-first business can feel really proud of, and painstakingly built a business where the ad business runs on the same high octane gas as the subscription business.  
> 
> 我们煞费苦心地建立了一个广告业务，作为一个不断发展的订阅至上的企业，我们可以为此感到真正自豪，并且煞费苦心地建立了一个广告业务与订阅业务使用相同的高辛烷值气体运行的业务。  
> 
> That is registered, logged in, highly engaged qualified audience who spend a lot of time with our product and where we get a lot of signal in privacy-forward ways, non-intrusive ways about what’s interesting to them.  
> 
> 这是注册、登录、高度参与的合格观众，他们花了很多时间在我们的产品上，我们以隐私转发的方式、非侵入性的方式获得了很多关于他们感兴趣的信号。

In other words, the New York Times has a big advantage in terms of first party data, in addition to serving a premium advertising segment, precisely because it has focused first-and-foremost on [having a subscription-driven editorial approach](https://stratechery.com/2015/in-defense-of-the-new-york-times/).  

换句话说，《纽约时报》在第一方数据方面具有很大优势，除了服务于优质广告细分市场之外，正是因为它首先关注的是采用订阅驱动的编辑方法。  

This gets back to my “evolution” point: what the New York Times got right is that while it has both business models, it has been very clear-eyed that the subscription model aligns with its editorial approach (and vice-versa), and subsequently made clear that advertising is valuable as long as it it is subservient to that model.  

这又回到了我的“进化”观点：《纽约时报》的正确之处在于，虽然它拥有两种商业模式，但它非常清楚订阅模式与其编辑方式一致（反之亦然），并且随后明确表示，只要广告服从于该模型，它就是有价值的。

**YouTube:** Speaking of 2015, that was the year that YouTube launched YouTube Premium (it was called YouTube Red at the time), and I didn’t get it at first. I wrote in an [Update](https://stratechery.com/2015/youtube-red-yahoo-stumbles/):  

YouTube：说到2015年，那一年YouTube推出了YouTube Premium（当时叫YouTube Red），一开始没看懂。我在更新中写道：

> My initial reaction to YouTube Red was befuddlement; while the “pay-to-remove-ads” business model may make sense for a small independent developer just slapping an ad network inside their app, for a company operating at YouTube’s scale the model has a potentially fatal contradiction: the people who are most likely to be willing to pay to remove ads are usually the exact same people advertisers most want to reach.  
> 
> 我对 YouTube Red 的最初反应是困惑；虽然“付费删除广告”的商业模式对于一个在他们的应用程序中打广告网络的小型独立开发者来说可能是有意义的，但对于像 YouTube 这样规模的公司来说，这种模式有一个潜在的致命矛盾：最重要的人可能愿意为删除广告付费的人通常是广告商最想接触的人群。  
> 
> True, few if any customers are likely to generate $120/year worth of advertising revenue, but the entire point of an advertising business model is to sell access to a wide audience at scale; YouTube Red potentially limits the size of that audience even as it makes it less valuable on an average user basis.  
> 
> 诚然，很少有客户可能每年产生价值 120 美元的广告收入，但广告商业模式的全部意义在于向广大受众大规模销售访问权； YouTube Red 可能会限制该受众群体的规模，即使它降低了它在普通用户基础上的价值。
> 
> Moreover, this seems a particularly strange time to reduce the focus on advertising for YouTube in particular: for years we have been waiting for a significant shift in brand advertising dollars from TV to digital, and with TV viewership suddenly declining significantly, particularly amongst millennials, it seems that time is finally nigh.  
> 
> 此外，这似乎是一个特别奇怪的时间来减少对 YouTube 广告的关注：多年来，我们一直在等待品牌广告收入从电视到数字的重大转变，随着电视收视率突然大幅下降，尤其是在千禧一代中，看来时间终于到了。  
> 
> Why not double-down on advertising?  
> 
> 为什么不在广告上加倍努力？

All discussions of YouTube need to include the very large caveat that Google still — in what I believe is [a violation of SEC rules](https://stratechery.com/2020/googles-earnings-youtube-and-google-cloud-googles-falling-margin/) — refuses to disclose YouTube’s costs (and thus profit); the company also doesn’t break out YouTube Premium subscriptions. However, it was notable on [the company’s last earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4596558-alphabet-inc-goog-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/) that management called out the fact that YouTube subscriptions drove 9% growth in “Google Other” revenue, even as YouTube ad revenue once again declined (because, [I suspect](https://stratechery.com/2022/twitter-follow-up-google-earnings-att-and-google/), Apple’s App Tracking Transparency changes). That ad revenue, though, is still up massively from 2015; there doesn’t seem to be any tension in having both models at the same time.  

所有关于 YouTube 的讨论都需要包括一个非常重要的警告，即谷歌仍然拒绝披露 YouTube 的成本（以及利润）——我认为这违反了美国证券交易委员会的规定；该公司也没有打破 YouTube Premium 订阅。然而，值得注意的是，在公司上一次财报电话会议上，管理层指出 YouTube 订阅推动“Google 其他”收入增长 9%，尽管 YouTube 广告收入再次下降（我怀疑是因为 Apple 的 App Tracking Transparency 发生了变化） ).不过，该广告收入仍比 2015 年大幅增长；同时拥有两种模型似乎没有任何压力。

What is notable is that YouTube Premium is a much simpler product than YouTube Red tried to be: the latter invested in original content, both from Hollywood and from YouTube creators; the rebrand to YouTube Premium, though, led to the end of most of those initiatives.  

值得注意的是，YouTube Premium 是一款比 YouTube Red 试图成为的产品简单得多的产品：后者投资于好莱坞和 YouTube 创作者的原创内容；不过，将品牌重塑为 YouTube Premium 导致了大部分此类举措的结束。  

Instead the value proposition was as simple as could be: YouTube without ads (and some additional functionality, including downloads and background listening, for music in particular).  

相反，价值主张尽可能简单：没有广告的 YouTube（以及一些额外的功能，包括下载和后台收听，尤其是音乐）。  

This, in the end, is the subscription model that I think makes the most sense for a scale product whose primary business model is ads: pay to remove them, but otherwise leave the product the same.  

最后，我认为订阅模式对于主要商业模式是广告的规模化产品最有意义：付费移除广告，但产品保持不变。

**Netflix:** The company I should probably use here is Hulu; one of the reasons I argued [Why Netflix Should Sell Ads](https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/) is because Hulu had already shown that a streaming service could have a higher average revenue per customer on a cheaper ad-supported plan than on a higher-priced no-ad plan.  

Netflix：我应该在这里使用的公司是 Hulu；我争论为什么 Netflix 应该出售广告的原因之一是因为 Hulu 已经表明，相比价格更高的无广告计划，流媒体服务可以通过更便宜的广告支持计划获得更高的每位客户平均收入。  

Netflix has already achieved exactly that; [last quarter](https://stratechery.com/2023/netflix-earnings-netflixs-movie-strategy-accretive-ads/) the company’s $6.99 “Basic + Ads” plan had a higher average revenue per member than the company’s $15.49 “Standard” plan in North America.  

Netflix 已经做到了这一点；上个季度，该公司 6.99 美元的“基本+广告”计划的每位会员平均收入高于该公司在北美的 15.49 美元“标准”计划。

Netflix has already adjusted, changing “Basic + Ads” to “Standard + Ads”; the only difference with the regular Standard plan is that, as with YouTube, there are no downloads with the ad-supported plan (which makes total sense: if a device is offline then it can’t be served ads).  

Netflix已经调整，将“Basic + Ads”改为“Standard + Ads”；与常规标准计划的唯一区别是，与 YouTube 一样，广告支持计划没有下载（这完全有道理：如果设备处于离线状态，则无法为其投放广告）。  

I think, though, the streaming service should go further.  

不过，我认为流媒体服务应该走得更远。  

Work backwards from the proposition that the only difference between the ad-supported plan and the Standard plan is the absence of ads, and layer on the fact that Netflix is a scale service that seeks to have content for everyone, and it follows that Netflix should probably end up in the same place that YouTube is: have one free ad-supported plan and one paid plan, with the only difference being the presence or lack thereof of ads.  

从广告支持计划和标准计划之间的唯一区别是没有广告的命题倒推，并基于 Netflix 是一项旨在为每个人提供内容的规模服务这一事实，因此 Netflix 应该最终可能会与 YouTube 处于同一位置：有一个免费的广告支持计划和一个付费计划，唯一的区别是是否存在广告。

### Leverage and Content Costs  

杠杆和内容成本

The irony of Netflix being both ad supported and subscription supported is that that was the business model of TV; customers paid for cable (which passed along affiliate fees to cable networks and retransmission fees to broadcast networks) and also had to endure advertisements during their favorite shows.  

具有讽刺意味的是，Netflix 既支持广告又支持订阅，这就是电视的商业模式；客户为有线电视付费（有线电视将附属费用转嫁给有线电视网络，将转播费转嫁给广播网络），并且还不得不在他们最喜欢的节目中忍受广告。

TV, meanwhile, was only one piece of a larger content strategy for entertainment companies: the products that required the most investment — movies — were subject to a windowing approach, where a film was first released in theaters, then pay-per-view, then premium TV, then cable, and finally free TV.  

与此同时，电视只是娱乐公司更大的内容战略的一部分：需要最多投资的产品——电影——采用窗口方式，电影首先在影院上映，然后按次付费，然后是付费电视，然后是有线电视，最后是免费电视。  

The logic behind this approach was to utilize time to maximize leverage on the costs necessary to create the content in the first place.  

这种方法背后的逻辑是首先利用时间最大限度地利用创建内容所需的成本。  

Netflix isn’t particularly interested in windowing (which I think is [understandable in the case of movies](https://stratechery.com/2023/netflix-earnings-netflixs-movie-strategy-accretive-ads/), even if I think they should do weekly releases for their most popular shows), but offering the choice of whether or not ads are included is leveraging convenience and the overall user experience to achieve a similar sort of segmentation.  

Netflix 对窗口不是特别感兴趣（我认为这在电影的情况下是可以理解的，即使我认为他们应该为他们最受欢迎的节目每周发布一次），但提供是否包括广告的选择是利用便利和整体用户体验来实现类似的细分。

What is important to note is that leverage is still very important: Netflix has an advantage over other streaming services because it has the most subscribers, which means its per-subscriber cost for new content is lower.  

需要注意的是，杠杆作用仍然非常重要：Netflix 相对于其他流媒体服务具有优势，因为它拥有最多的订阅者，这意味着其新内容的每个订阅者成本较低。  

That advantage grows with the new subscribers Netflix is able to attract to their ad-supported tier; if Netflix had a free ad-supported plan that advantage would be even larger.  

随着 Netflix 能够吸引到其广告支持层级的新订户，这种优势会越来越大；如果 Netflix 有一个免费的广告支持计划，那么优势会更大。  

YouTube, meanwhile, gets its content for free, but has to make major investments in infrastructure, moderation, etc. (the amount of which we don’t — but should — know).  

与此同时，YouTube 免费获得其内容，但必须在基础设施、节制等方面进行重大投资（我们不知道但应该知道的数量）。  

The key takeaway, though, is that while the means of leveraging content may have changed with the Internet, the importance of doing so remains the same.  

不过，关键的一点是，虽然利用内容的方式可能随着 Internet 发生了变化，但这样做的重要性仍然不变。

### The Hole in the Funnel  

漏斗中的洞

Of course YouTube isn’t the only “free” content on the Internet: social networks like Facebook or Twitter and user-generated content networks like TikTok have tons of content as well.  

当然，YouTube 并不是互联网上唯一的“免费”内容：Facebook 或 Twitter 等社交网络以及 TikTok 等用户生成的内容网络也有大量内容。  

There are also things like video games, and even traditional TV — the amount of content available to end users is infinite, and covers every possible niche; AI is only going to make the abundance more overwhelming, and perfectly customized to boot.  

还有像视频游戏，甚至传统电视这样的东西——最终用户可用的内容是无限的，涵盖了所有可能的细分市场； AI 只会让丰富的事物变得更加压倒一切，并完美地定制启动。

In this world the only scarce resource is attention: even if a user is “second-screening” — on their phone while watching TV, for example — they are only ever paying attention to one piece of content at any given moment.  

在这个世界上，唯一稀缺的资源是注意力：即使用户正在“二次筛选”——例如，一边看电视一边玩手机——他们在任何特定时刻都只会关注一个内容。  

It follows, then, that value is a function of attention, because value is always downstream from scarcity.  

因此，价值是注意力的函数，因为价值总是在稀缺性的下游。

This has further implications for content companies: to maximize leverage on their costs content companies must have well-considered funnels for acquiring customers and monetizing them.  

这对内容公司有进一步的影响：为了最大限度地利用其成本，内容公司必须拥有经过深思熟虑的渠道来获取客户并将其货币化。  

One example I’ve been thinking a lot about is the NBA: the league’s social media presence is very strong, but there was a major disconnect between broad awareness of players and teams and the league’s business model, which, [as I explained earlier this year](https://stratechery.com/2023/what-the-nba-can-learn-from-formula-1/), was anchored in the cable bundle, with a looming weak spot in terms of local rights and regional sports networks. The conundrum facing the league was clear:  

我一直在思考的一个例子是 NBA：联盟在社交媒体上的影响力非常大，但球员和球队的广泛知名度与联盟的商业模式之间存在重大脱节，正如我今年早些时候解释的那样, 被锚定在电缆束中，在地方权利和区域体育网络方面隐现弱点。联盟面临的难题很明显：

![The NBA's hole in the funnel](unifiedcontent-2.png)

In a world where everyone has cable then having a strong social media presence is great; people can simply turn on the TV to check out a game.  

在一个人人都有有线电视的世界里，拥有强大的社交媒体影响力是件好事；人们可以简单地打开电视来观看一场比赛。  

If a huge number of households have cut the cord, though, particularly in younger demographics that will hopefully grow into lifelong fans, then the price of entry is signing up for Pay TV, a major commitment that hardly seems worth it for a sport you are only vaguely aware of.  

但是，如果大量家庭切断了电源线，尤其是希望成长为终生粉丝的年轻人群，那么入门价格就是注册付费电视，这是一项重大承诺，但对于您正在参加的一项运动来说似乎并不值得只是模模糊糊地知道。

The Phoenix Suns, though, are trying something different: the team is (pending litigation from its former regional sports network) going to make its local games available over-the-air and on a team-branded streaming service. As [I discussed yesterday](https://stratechery.com/2023/the-phoenix-suns-go-over-the-air-fans-and-franchise-valuation-attention-and-customer-acquisition/) this fills in the missing piece of the funnel:  

不过，菲尼克斯太阳队正在尝试一些不同的东西：球队（正在等待其前区域体育网络的诉讼）将通过无线方式和球队品牌的流媒体服务提供当地比赛。正如我昨天讨论的那样，这填补了漏斗中缺失的部分：

> This is why I have been concerned about the long-term outlook for the league: it’s hard enough to get attention in the modern era, but it’s even harder if your product isn’t even available to half of your addressable market.  
> 
> 这就是为什么我一直担心联盟的长期前景：在现代时代获得关注已经够难了，但如果你的产品甚至无法进入一半的潜在市场，那就更难了。  
> 
> That was the reality, though, of being on an RSN: social media gave the NBA top of the funnel awareness, but there wasn’t an obvious next step for potential new fans who weren’t yet willing to pay for pay TV.  
> 
> 不过，这就是加入 RSN 的现实：社交媒体让 NBA 成为漏斗意识的顶端，但对于那些还不愿意为付费电视付费的潜在新球迷来说，没有明显的下一步。
> 
> However, if this deal goes through, that next step will exist in Phoenix: potential fans can check out games over the air or through a Suns/Mercury app; if they like what they see they will soon be disappointed that they can’t see the best games, which are reserved for the national TV networks.  
> 
> 然而，如果这笔交易成功，菲尼克斯将采取下一步行动：潜在的球迷可以通过无线方式或通过太阳队/水星队的应用程序观看比赛；如果他们喜欢他们所看到的，他们很快就会因为看不到最好的比赛而感到失望，这些比赛是为国家电视网络保留的。  
> 
> That, though, is a good thing: now the Suns/Mercury are giving fans a reason to get cable again (or something like YouTube TV), increasing the value of the NBA to those networks along the way.  
> 
> 不过，这是一件好事：现在太阳队/水星队让球迷有理由再次获得有线电视（或 YouTube 电视之类的东西），从而增加了 NBA 对这些网络的价值。  
> 
> And, of course, there is the most obvious way to monetize content on the Internet: deliver a real-world experience that can’t be replicated online — in this case attending a game in person.  
> 
> 当然，还有一种最明显的方法可以将互联网内容货币化：提供无法在线复制的真实世界体验——在这种情况下，亲自参加比赛。
> 
> All of this is good news for the long term value of \[Suns owner Mat\] Ishbia’s teams, and, by extension, good news for the NBA and the networks that buy its rights.  
> 
> 所有这一切对于 \[太阳队老板马特\] 伊什比亚的球队的长期价值来说都是好消息，而且对于 NBA 和购买其权利的网络来说也是好消息。  
> 
> Yes, forgone RSN money will hurt, but not having an effective customer acquisition funnel hurts even more.  
> 
> 是的，放弃 RSN 资金会造成伤害，但没有有效的客户获取渠道会造成更大伤害。

This exact reasoning applies to Netflix, too: the company used to offer free trials, but given how easy they were to abuse the company ended them in 2020; that, though, meant the company had its own hole in the funnel.  

这个道理也适用于 Netflix：该公司过去提供免费试用，但考虑到他们很容易被滥用，公司在 2020 年终止了这些服务；不过，这意味着该公司在漏斗中有自己的漏洞。  

Potential users might hear about shows that interested them, but the only way to check them out was to actually pull out their credit card; that is, to be fair, still the case today, but at least the ad-supported plan is cheaper.  

潜在用户可能听说过他们感兴趣的节目，但查看这些节目的唯一方法是实际掏出他们的信用卡；也就是说，公平地说，今天仍然如此，但至少广告支持的计划更便宜。  

This is also the argument as to why the ad-supported plan should eventually be free: the best way to get customers interested in your premium subscription is to get them watching your content and getting annoyed that ads are in the way of consuming more of it!  

这也是关于为什么广告支持的计划最终应该免费的争论：让客户对您的高级订阅感兴趣的最好方法是让他们观看您的内容并对广告妨碍消费更多内容感到恼火！

### Creator Services 创作者服务

All of this is not, for the record, a prelude to introducing ads on Stratechery.  

郑重声明，所有这一切并不是在 Stratechery 上引入广告的前奏。  

While Stratechery arguably competes with the New York Times for user attention, I don’t have the resources to sell ads, even if I think it would be a perfectly fine thing to do (although [my approach to ethics](https://stratechery.com/about/#ethics) would preclude accepting advertising from any company I cover).  

虽然可以说 Stratechery 与《纽约时报》争夺用户关注度，但我没有资源来销售广告，即使我认为这样做是一件非常好的事情（尽管我的道德准则会排除接受任何公司的广告我覆盖）。

Things would be different if and when I ever launch video: one of the things that makes YouTube such a brilliant platform is that from the very early days the service has had a revenue share with creators.  

如果我推出视频，情况就会有所不同：YouTube 之所以成为如此出色的平台，其中一个原因是从很早的时候起，该服务就与创作者分享收入。  

This lets creators benefit from the capabilities of the largest digital ad company in the world without any additional work; the creator’s only job is to create content that is compelling enough to earn views (and thus advertising revenue), which benefits YouTube.  

这让创作者无需任何额外工作即可受益于世界上最大的数字广告公司的能力；创作者唯一的工作就是创作足够吸引人的内容来赢得观看次数（从而获得广告收入），这对 YouTube 有利。

Spotify is working to build out something similar for podcasting: yes, there is podcast advertising, but [the market is fundamentally limited](https://stratechery.com/2019/spotifys-podcast-aggregation-play/) to high-price or high-LTV products, and the barrier to being a viable podcast is fairly high as far as total listeners go (and the market, at least anecdotally, seems to be struggling).  

Spotify 正在努力为播客构建类似的东西：是的，有播客广告，但市场从根本上仅限于高价格或高 LTV 产品，就总听众而言，成为可行播客的障碍相当高去吧（至少从传闻来看，市场似乎在挣扎）。  

What Spotify is trying to build is something much more akin to YouTube: targeted advertising at scale, where the only responsibility of content creators is to make something that users want to listen to.  

Spotify 正在尝试构建的东西更类似于 YouTube：大规模有针对性的广告，内容创作者的唯一责任是制作用户想听的东西。

I think that Substack is making a mistake in not doing the same thing for writing: it’s simply not viable for one-person or small-team publishers to sell ads effectively; Substack, though, has aggregated a whole slew of them, and thus is uniquely positioned to create value for its writers collectively by building out an ad product.  

我认为 Substack 犯了一个错误，没有为写作做同样的事情：单人或小团队出版商根本无法有效地销售广告；不过，Substack 已经聚合了一大堆，因此具有独特的优势，可以通过构建广告产品为其作者共同创造价值。  

This, by extension, could help Substack authors with their own hole in the funnel: moving readers from links in tweets to paying subscribers would be easier if there were a money-making layer in the middle.  

推而广之，这可以帮助 Substack 作者解决他们自己在漏斗中的漏洞：如果中间有一个赚钱层，将读者从推文中的链接转移到付费订阅者会更容易。

Of course the freemium strategy is a good alternative; that has always been the business model here on Stratechery, both for my writing and my podcasts.  

当然，免费增值策略是一个不错的选择。这一直是 Stratechery 的商业模式，无论是对于我的写作还是我的播客。  

Indeed, that really is the real name for the “Unified Content Model”: everything, in the end, is on its way to freemium.  

事实上，这确实是“统一内容模型”的真名：一切最终都在走向免费增值。  

The right place to draw the line will and should differ based on whether a product is niche or scaled, and on the cost structure of the content producer; what seems less necessary, given the need to both leverage content costs and acquire customers effectively, is being religious about only making money in one specific way.  

划界线的正确位置将而且应该根据产品是利基市场还是规模化以及内容制作者的成本结构而有所不同；考虑到既需要利用内容成本又需要有效地获取客户，似乎不太必要的是只以一种特定的方式赚钱。

PRODUCED BY HUNNI MEDIA FOR KNOWABLE MAGAZINE  

由 HUNNI MEDIA 为 KNOWABLE 杂志制作

Taking stock of what went wrong in the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic can help the nation better prepare for the next global health emergency.  

评估美国在应对 Covid-19 大流行中出现的问题可以帮助该国更好地为下一次全球卫生紧急情况做好准备。  

With the official “emergency” over, _Knowable Magazine_ looked back at the many lessons we heard from experts from throughout the pandemic — many of which still haven’t been acted upon.  

随着官方“紧急情况”的结束，《Knowable》杂志回顾了我们从整个大流行期间从专家那里听到的许多教训，其中许多教训仍然没有得到采取行动。  

From the need for a more robust disease surveillance system to moving away from the idea that nations are isolated from health threats that arise on other continents, scientists discuss a number of shifts that must happen if the nation is to be ready for another massive outbreak of an emerging infectious disease.  

从需要更强大的疾病监测系统到摆脱国家与其他大陆出现的健康威胁隔离的想法，科学家们讨论了如果国家要为另一次大规模疫情做好准备就必须做出的一些转变。一种新出现的传染病。

Key takeaways from the interviews include:  

采访的主要内容包括：

-   We need to expect the emergence of new diseases that jump to humans from animals.  
    
    我们需要预见到从动物传染给人类的新疾病的出现。  
    
    People play a role through climate change, habitat destruction and closer interactions with wildlife.  
    
    人们通过气候变化、栖息地破坏以及与野生动物更密切的互动发挥作用。
-   Public health emergencies need to be viewed as potentially destructive as natural disasters such as wildfire, hurricanes and floods. And the response needs to be as swift.  
    
    突发公共卫生事件需要被视为与野火、飓风和洪水等自然灾害一样具有潜在破坏性。响应也需要同样迅速。
-   No one should underestimate a new emerging disease. Officials need to be frank about its potential threat and open about what’s still unknown.  
    
    任何人都不应该低估一种新出现的疾病。官员们需要坦白其潜在威胁，并公开未知的情况。
-   The US can and should learn from other countries, many of which have more experience identifying and controlling emerging infectious diseases through strong surveillance and testing regimes.  
    
    美国可以而且应该向其他国家学习，其中许多国家在通过强有力的监测和检测制度识别和控制新发传染病方面拥有更多经验。
-   Public health measures are not focused on an individual, they are meant to prevent illness and reduce spread of disease within a community. It’s not just about one person but many.  
    
    公共卫生措施并不针对个人，而是为了预防疾病并减少疾病在社区内的传播。这不只是一个人的事，而是很多人的事。
-   Pandemic responses must be balanced with respect for individual liberty in a democracy, which can make it harder to control the spread of infection.  
    
    在民主国家，流行病应对措施必须与尊重个人自由相平衡，这可能会使控制感染的传播变得更加困难。  
    
    Communities need to work together to figure out the right balance.  
    
    社区需要共同努力找到适当的平衡点。
-   Establishing and maintaining trust with the public is a key part of any disease response.  
    
    与公众建立和维持信任是任何疾病应对措施的关键部分。  
    
    Misinformation and disinformation about the pandemic have serious repercussions on the population’s health and need to be addressed.  
    
    有关这一流行病的错误信息和虚假信息对人们的健康造成严重影响，需要加以解决。
-   Education is a key part of preparing for a pandemic and more could be done in schools to introduce students to the science of how diseases emerge and spread.  
    
    教育是应对大流行病的关键部分，学校可以做更多工作，向学生介绍疾病如何出现和传播的科学知识。
-   Individuals have a lot of power to help curb disease outbreaks.  
    
    个人有很大的力量来帮助遏制疾病的爆发。

## Transcript 成绩单

**Apoorva Mandavilli (science and health reporter, the _New York Times_):** I think this pandemic and the climate change that we’re seeing right now should really serve as a wake-up call to all of us that this world has changed.  

阿普尔瓦·曼达维利（《纽约时报》科学与健康记者）：我认为我们现在看到的这场流行病和气候变化确实应该给我们所有人敲响警钟，让我们知道这个世界已经改变了。

**WHO official:** The magnitude of this \[monkeypox\] outbreak poses a real risk.  

世卫组织官员：这次\[猴痘\]疫情的严重程度构成了真正的风险。

**Apoorva Mandavilli:** We are going to see more zoonotic viruses, because people live in such close proximity to animals now, and there’s so many more opportunities for viruses to jump back and forth between humans and animals.  

阿普尔瓦·曼达维利：我们将会看到更多的人畜共患病毒，因为现在人们与动物的生活距离如此之近，病毒在人类和动物之间来回传播的机会也越来越多。  

And throw into that, this mix of climate change, warming climates everywhere.  

再加上气候变化、各地气候变暖的综合影响。  

Infectious diseases are going to be a bigger problem, right along with all the environmental problems we’re going to see.  

传染病将与我们将看到的所有环境问题一样成为一个更大的问题。  

So we really need to prepare and plan for a future that includes a lot of other bad surprises like this one.  

因此，我们确实需要为未来做好准备和计划，其中包括许多像这样的其他糟糕的意外情况。

**Jonna Mazet (epidemiologist and disease ecologist, University of California, Davis):** I think that if everyone had jumped in really early and vigilantly — like we do for wildfires and other kinds of disasters — we would’ve gotten it under control and wouldn’t still be sitting in these circumstances that we’re in now.  

乔娜·马泽特（流行病学家和疾病生态学家，加州大学戴维斯分校）：我认为，如果每个人都尽早并保持警惕——就像我们对野火和其他类型的灾难所做的那样——我们就能控制住疫情，并且不会“我们现在所处的情况已经不再是这样了。

**President Donald Trump:** I mean, view this the same as the flu. I really think, Doctor, you want to treat this like you treat the flu, right? And it’s going to be fine.  

唐纳德·特朗普总统：我的意思是，将此视为与流感相同。我真的想，医生，您想像治疗流感一样治疗这个问题，对吗？一切都会好起来的。

**William Hanage (epidemiologist, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health):** Unfortunately, there was a real tendency to compare this with flu, which has had a number of damaging effects.  

William Hanage（哈佛大学陈曾熙公共卫生学院流行病学家）：不幸的是，人们确实倾向于将其与流感进行比较，流感已经产生了许多破坏性影响。  

For a start, the most recent flu pandemic was H1N1, which was a pandemic, killed lots and lots of people, but was nowhere near this scale.  

首先，最近的流感大流行是 H1N1 流感，这是一种大流行病，造成了很多人死亡，但规模远没有达到这个程度。  

So people understand it in the wrong way then.  

所以人们以错误的方式理解它。  

It is not the flu, and yet for reasons that I do not understand, there have been some throughout the pandemic who have been working really, really hard to minimize it, to pretend that it isn’t as bad as it is.  

这不是流感，但出于我不明白的原因，在整个大流行期间，有些人一直在非常非常努力地努力将其最小化，假装它没有那么糟糕。  

There was also a tendency, even among some infectious disease professionals, to say that this would fade away, it would be like SARS.  

即使在一些传染病专业人士中，也存在一种倾向，认为这种情况将会消失，就像非典一样。  

And the public health consequences of that have been what you’ve seen.  

您已经看到了由此产生的公共卫生后果。  

They have been dreadful. And they’re still going on even as we’re talking now.  

他们太可怕了。即使我们现在正在谈论，它们仍在继续。

**Anthony Fauci:** I hope we are still learning a very important lesson from Covid, is that you never ever underestimate an emerging infection in which you don’t know where it’s going.  

安东尼·福奇：我希望我们仍然能从新冠疫情中学到一个非常重要的教训，那就是，永远不要低估一种新出现的感染，因为你不知道它的去向。

**Global responses: Lessons to learn  

全球应对措施：值得吸取的教训**

**Andrew Lo (economist and professor of finance, MIT Sloan School of Management):** The United States is at the top of the list in the number of Covid-related deaths, but we’re certainly not the most populous country on the planet.  

安德鲁·罗（麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院经济学家、金融学教授）：美国在与新冠病毒相关的死亡人数方面名列前茅，但我们肯定不是地球上人口最多的国家。  

We spend more money per capita on health care than virtually any other country in the world.  

我们在医疗保健上的人均花费几乎比世界上任何其他国家都多。  

So we’re going to have to answer a lot of very difficult questions about what we did right and what we did wrong.  

因此，我们将不得不回答很多非常困难的问题，比如我们做对了什么、做错了什么。

**Newscaster:** The Democratic Republic of Congo announced that it was facing an outbreak of Ebola.  

新闻播音员：刚果民主共和国宣布面临埃博拉疫情。

**Jonna Mazet:** In the US and other really highly developed countries, we have a convenient arrogance.  

Jonna Mazet：在美国和其他高度发达国家，我们有一种便利的傲慢态度。  

We see these tragic diseases happening elsewhere and we think, “Oh, well, that’s because they don’t have a good public health system” or “They don’t have the health insurance and doctors that I have.” I don’t think that’s true, actually, and this one proves it.  

我们看到这些悲惨的疾病在其他地方发生，我们想，“哦，好吧，那是因为他们没有良好的公共卫生系统”或“他们没有我拥有的健康保险和医生。”事实上，我认为这不是真的，这个证明了这一点。

They may have the perfect storm for more spillover events in those other places, and so they see more disease on a regular basis, more mystery disease, more fevers of unknown origin, so they’re more likely to jump in and investigate than we are here.  

他们可能会在其他地方发生更多溢出事件，因此他们会定期看到更多疾病，更多神秘疾病，更多不明原因的发烧，所以他们比我们更有可能介入并进行调查这里。

**Pardis Sabeti (computational geneticist, Harvard University):** A lot of us knew that the US wasn’t prepared for anything like this. Our public health systems were just not up to the challenge, and I’d seen that during the Ebola outbreak.  

Pardis Sabeti（哈佛大学计算遗传学家）：我们很多人都知道美国没有为这样的事情做好准备。我们的公共卫生系统无法应对挑战，我在埃博拉疫情爆发期间就看到了这一点。  

Our response to the Ebola outbreak nationally was not great. We didn’t have diagnostics in most states. The first cases were misdiagnosed. We bumbled a lot.  

我们在全国范围内对埃博拉疫情的反应并不好。我们在大多数州都没有诊断。第一批病例被误诊。我们犯了很多错误。  

We haven’t locked in and said, “Oh, this is actually our problem. It’s something we need to solve.”  

我们还没有锁定并说：“哦，这实际上是我们的问题。这是我们需要解决的问题。”

**Apoorva Mandavilli:** One very big lesson from this pandemic is that we don’t really have good systems in place to know when there’s a new pathogen that’s circulating, and to be able to alert people.  

阿普尔瓦·曼达维利（Apoorva Mandavilli）：这次大流行的一个非常大的教训是，我们并没有真正建立良好的系统来了解何时有新的病原体正在传播，并能够向人们发出警报。

**Jonna Mazet:** Our system is very good for known diseases. It has almost no resilience for emerging diseases. When you go to the doctor with a fever, do they investigate that fever?  

Jonna Mazet：我们的系统对于已知疾病非常有效。它对新出现的疾病几乎没有抵抗力。当你发烧去看医生时，他们会检查你的发烧情况吗？  

Or do they say, “It’s not the usual suspects, go home and rest. Get plenty of fluids. You should be better.  

或者他们会说：“这不是通常的嫌疑人，回家休息吧。补充充足的液体。你应该更好。  

If not, come back and see me.” So that’s our attitude here, because we feel like we’ve controlled so many of the diseases, and we feel like the world is separated into places that are really developed and places that don’t have the infrastructure to take care of their people.  

如果没有的话，就回来见我吧。”这就是我们的态度，因为我们觉得我们已经控制了很多疾病，而且我们觉得世界分为真正发达的地方和没有基础设施来照顾人民的地方。  

And I’m here to tell you, we are one global community.  

我来这里是为了告诉你们，我们是一个全球社区。  

And if we don’t learn from this tragedy that we are connected to every other person in the world — I can get to any other person in the world in 48 hours.  

如果我们不从这场悲剧中认识到，我们与世界上的每个人都息息相关——我可以在 48 小时内联系到世界上任何其他人。  

So if that’s the case, then we are one community.  

如果是这样的话，那么我们就是一个社区。  

And we need to care about what’s going on in DRC, in China, if we’re going to protect ourselves.  

如果我们想保护自己，我们就需要关心刚果民主共和国和中国正在发生的事情。

**Apoorva Mandavilli:** One thing this has told us is that the world is so interconnected that we can’t just take care of surveillance in our own country and forget about everywhere else.  

阿普尔瓦·曼达维利：这告诉我们一件事，世界是如此相互联系，我们不能只关注自己国家的监控而忘记其他地方。  

If there is something that is brewing somewhere else, it is going to come here. So the world needs to come together to figure out how to alert each other to an emerging pathogen.  

如果有什么东西正在别处酝酿，它就会来到这里。因此，世界需要齐心协力，找出如何针对一种新出现的病原体相互发出警报。  

Can’t just be left up to the World Health Organization, which these days is underfunded and really quite beholden to the US and China.  

不能仅仅依靠世界卫生组织，该组织目前资金不足，而且确实对美国和中国负有很大的责任。  

We need so much more surveillance on an international scale.  

我们需要在国际范围内进行更多的监视。

**Pardis Sabeti:** Some of the places that have had the greatest, best response are places in Africa and Asia.  

Pardis Sabeti：反应最强烈、最好的一些地方是非洲和亚洲。  

They don’t have the kind of hubris that we do in the United States to feel as if we are impervious to this kind of thing. They understand the threat of infectious diseases.  

他们不像我们在美国那样傲慢，感觉我们对这种事情无动于衷。他们了解传染病的威胁。  

They’re much more trained. They’re much more thoughtful to this. They were poised and more ready for a response.  

他们训练有素。他们对此考虑得更周到。他们已经做好了应对的准备。  

Where in the US, this is really the first thing we’ve experienced in most of our lifetimes like this. It just showed. It showed.  

在美国，这确实是我们一生中第一次经历这样的事情。它刚刚显示。这显示了。

**William Hanage:** So the United States is suffering this massive death toll despite the fact it spends a huge amount of money on health care.  

威廉·哈内奇：所以，尽管美国在医疗保健上花费了大量资金，但它仍然遭受着如此巨大的死亡人数。  

The thing is that public health is somewhat different from the sort of individual health. It’s not an individualistic thing at all.  

问题是，公共健康与个人健康有些不同。这根本不是个人主义的事情。  

What we \[public health workers\] do is we think about prevention. We try to think of ways in which we are able to avoid people getting sick in the first place.  

我们\[公共卫生工作者\]所做的就是考虑预防。我们首先尝试思考如何能够避免人们生病。  

We try and think of ways in which we can avoid transmission. That’s what this game is about.  

我们尝试并思考可以避免传播的方法。这就是这个游戏的意义所在。  

And the inability to think about that in those terms has been really difficult, has been really problematic for the US.  

无法从这些角度思考这一点确实很困难，对美国来说确实是一个问题。  

There are other countries which have had pretty bad responses, but the capita mortality is still nowhere near what it is in some states of the US.  

还有其他国家的反应相当糟糕，但人均死亡率仍远不及美国某些州的水平。  

So that is the thing which is truly remarkable. It is that inaction which is so difficult to comprehend.  

这才是真正了不起的事情。正是这种无所作为是很难理解的。

**Pardis Sabeti:** Viruses expose and exploit the cracks in our society, and so whatever the problems were before, they’re just going to be heightened.  

Pardis Sabeti：病毒暴露并利用了我们社会的裂痕，因此无论以前存在什么问题，它们都只会变得更加严重。  

And so we had racial injustice — it’s going to, you’re going to double down during an outbreak.  

因此，我们面临种族不平等——在疫情爆发期间，这种情况将会加倍。  

We had sort of issues with trust in our leadership — you’re just going to double down. And we had perverse capitalism, capitalistic incentives — they got outrageous.  

我们对我们的领导力存在一些信任问题——你只会加倍努力。我们有不正当的资本主义、资本主义激励——它们变得令人发指。  

This is everything that is wrong in your society is just going to be through a magnifying glass in this kind of a circumstance.  

在这种情况下，你们社会中的一切错误都将通过放大镜看到。  

An outbreak is a crucible where you have all of these different forces collectively coming together to create sort of a very toxic culture that we call outbreak culture.  

爆发是一个熔炉，所有这些不同的力量聚集在一起，创造出一种非常有毒的文化，我们称之为爆发文化。

And in order to overcome it, you have to first recognize that that’s the case.  

为了克服它，你必须首先认识到情况就是如此。  

It’s something that will happen and it’s OK to get crazy during an outbreak, but then to commit to altruism and commit to cooperation and to bring your best self to every interaction, because you realize that the virus thrives with this misbehavior.  

这是会发生的事情，在疫情爆发期间发疯是可以的，但随后要致力于利他主义，致力于合作，并在每次互动中展现出最好的自己，因为你意识到病毒会随着这种不当行为而繁殖。

The more we fight amongst ourselves, the easier it is for the virus to get out. One way or another.  

我们之间的斗争越激烈，病毒就越容易传播出去。不管怎样。  

Maybe at first you stop \[it\], but then at some point these breakdowns happen, and we’ve seen it again and again. Every time we see a breakdown in our society, the virus thrives.  

也许一开始你会停止\[它\]，但到了某个时候，这些故障就会发生，我们已经一次又一次地看到这种情况。每当我们看到社会崩溃时，病毒就会肆虐。

**Anthony Fauci:** Go to Rand Paul website and you see “Fire Dr. Fauci” with a little box that says, “Contribute here.” So the only thing you…  

安东尼·福奇：访问兰德·保罗网站，你会看到“解雇福奇博士”，上面有一个小框，上面写着“在这里贡献”。所以你唯一要做的就是……

**Senator Rand Paul:** You have politically attacked your colleagues…  

参议员兰德·保罗：你对你的同事进行了政治攻击......

**Pardis Sabeti:** These are not uniquely American problems, but you do realize it’s worse here. I mean, we’ve done really poorly. We have a lot of bureaucracy.  

Pardis Sabeti：这些并不是美国独有的问题，但你确实意识到这里的情况更糟。我的意思是，我们做得非常糟糕。我们有很多官僚主义。  

We have a lot of self-focused kind of behaviors, and so you put those all together and I think we are the least well-positioned in that regard.  

我们有很多以自我为中心的行为，所以你把这些都放在一起，我认为我们在这方面处于最不利的位置。

**Andrew Lo:** One issue that I think we do have to acknowledge is the fact that our form of government may actually contribute to these kinds of issues.  

Andrew Lo：我认为我们必须承认的一个问题是，我们的政府形式实际上可能会导致此类问题。  

So that’s a question that we’re going to have to answer. I don’t have the answer. It’s not even just an economic question.  

所以这是我们必须回答的问题。我没有答案。这甚至不仅仅是一个经济问题。  

It’s a moral, ethical, cultural, political set of questions that we have to deal with, about how in the situation of a pandemic, we as a country can come together to impose rules and regulations to minimize the number of deaths, while at the same time respecting everybody’s liberty.  

这是我们必须处理的一系列道德、伦理、文化和政治问题，即在大流行的情况下，我们作为一个国家如何能够共同制定规则和法规，以最大限度地减少死亡人数，同时同时尊重每个人的自由。

**Establishing trust: Media and science  

建立信任：媒体和科学**

**Jonna Mazet:** If you have the community with you and willing to mask and vaccinate and all of those things, you can have much better outcomes than many places where there was no pre-communication, no pre-planning, no pre-establishment of trust.  

Jonna Mazet：如果你有社区的支持，愿意戴口罩和接种疫苗以及所有这些事情，那么你可以获得比许多没有预先沟通、预先计划、预先建立信任的地方更好的结果。

**William Hanage:** It’s kind of Pandemic 101, that you maintain confidence from the public, and trust in the information that they’re getting, and you have to earn that trust.  

William Hanage：这有点像 Pandemic 101，你要保持公众的信心，相信他们得到的信息，你必须赢得这种信任。  

It’s not something which you can take for granted.  

这不是你可以认为理所当然的事情。  

Now, what actually happened in the United States and other places — but the United States, in particular — is that that information became suddenly political.  

现在，在美国和其他地方（尤其是美国）实际发生的情况是，这些信息突然变得政治化。  

Whether or not you thought the virus was a problem became a badge of identity rather than a matter of scientific fact.  

无论你是否认为病毒是一个问题，都成为了身份的标志，而不是科学事实的问题。  

And the people who have been trying to supply that information, they ended up being subjects of misinformation, basically — and misinformation which is still going on.  

那些一直试图提供这些信息的人，基本上最终成为了错误信息的对象——而且这种错误信息仍在继续。  

I think that the social media companies, the Facebooks and the Twitters of the world, they bear a strong degree of responsibility for that kind of thing.  

我认为世界各地的社交媒体公司、Facebook 和 Twitter 对此类事情负有很大的责任。  

And, as I keep saying, it’s not over yet.  

而且，正如我一直说的，事情还没有结束。

**Jonna Mazet:** We need the whole world to come together and recognize that there are big unknowns that are existential threats to us, and we cause them, and we have the power to fix them, but only if we actually acknowledge them and work on them.  

乔娜·马泽特（Jonna Mazet）：我们需要全世界团结起来，认识到存在着对我们生存构成威胁的巨大未知因素，而这些未知因素是我们造成的，我们有能力解决它们，但前提是我们真正承认它们并致力于解决它们。

**Pardis Sabeti:** The interesting thing about an infectious disease is unlike any other existential threat to humanity, every single person matters.  

Pardis Sabeti：传染病的有趣之处在于，与人类面临的任何其他生存威胁不同，每个人都很重要。  

And because one person can launch a pandemic, one person can stop it. And so there was an opportunity to go out to the people and say, “You matter. Let’s get you prepared.  

因为一个人可以引发一场流行病，一个人也可以阻止它。因此，我们有机会对人们说：“你们很重要。让我们帮您做好准备。  

OK, every single person, let’s go. OK? This is how diagnostic works. This is how contact tracing works.”  

好啦，大家都走吧。好的？这就是诊断的工作原理。这就是接触者追踪的工作原理。”

When are we ever going to get kids to understand genomics or diagnostics? This should have been… If I was the secretary of education, I would’ve said, “You know what?  

我们什么时候才能让孩子们了解基因组学或诊断学？这应该是……如果我是教育部长，我会说，“你知道吗？  

We’re scrapping all lesson plans this year. Lesson Plan 101 is figure out everything we can about an outbreak. Kids, let’s do this.” Group project, right?  

我们今年将取消所有课程计划。课程计划 101 是找出有关疫情爆发的一切信息。孩子们，我们来做吧。”小组项目，对吗？  

Because you have to know history. You have to know public health. You have to know mathematics, epidemiology, clinical medicine.  

因为你必须了解历史。你必须了解公共卫生。你必须懂数学、流行病学、临床医学。  

We could have taught them a range of skills that would’ve prepared them, and we would’ve had them participate with us to identify cases to support each other.  

我们本可以教他们一系列可以帮助他们做好准备的技能，并且我们可以让他们与我们一起参与找出案例以相互支持。

And you also have to teach sociology and care and mental health, like every single thing we would’ve done.  

你还必须教授社会学、护理和心理健康，就像我们所做的每一件事一样。  

If it was my opportunity to make that, is to just make that the challenge and make it be a group collective project.  

如果这是我实现这一目标的机会，那就将其作为挑战并使其成为一个团队集体项目。  

And ultimately when the stakes are high and when it’s personal, it’s where all the brain cells turn on.  

最终，当风险很高且事关个人时，所有脑细胞都会被激活。  

And to me, it was just a real waste that we didn’t engage students around the country.  

对我来说，我们没有吸引全国各地的学生，这真是一种浪费。  

And we didn’t do this thing where we say, “Let’s figure out how to do this and how to create circles of protection, how to protect Grandma and your community and your church.” I mean, that was sort of for me the opportunity that was lost.  

我们做这件事时并没有说：“让我们弄清楚如何做到这一点，如何创建保护圈，如何保护祖母、你的社区和你的教堂。”我的意思是，这对我来说是失去的机会。

**Jonna Mazet:** I worry that we keep thinking about the next surge and then the next influenza, and we should, but we can’t sit on our laurels while we do that and not think about disease X — the next one.  

乔娜·马泽特（Jonna Mazet）：我担心我们会一直在思考下一次激增，然后是下一次流感，我们应该这么做，但我们不能满足于现状，而不去思考 X 疾病——下一种疾病。  

We have five of these a year happening and they just don’t get out of control.  

我们每年都会发生五次这种情况，而且它们不会失控。  

If we don’t get ready for the next one to be way worse, more deadly, and more transmissible, if we let ourselves not be ready for that, the consequences will be much, much more severe even than this.  

如果我们没有为下一场更严重、更致命、更容易传播的疫情做好准备，如果我们没有做好准备，那么后果将比这严重得多。

If we do nothing and just say, “Wow, that was terrible.” Human nature again — our enemy here. “I don’t want to think about that anymore. That was terrible. I just need a break.  

如果我们什么都不做，只是说：“哇，那太糟糕了。”人性又是我们的敌人。 “我不想再想这个了。那太可怕了。我只是需要休息一下。  

I need to get on with our lives.” And we’re seeing that even in our public health agencies and government counterparts.  

我需要继续我们的生活。”我们甚至在公共卫生机构和政府同行中也看到了这一点。  

“Let’s just get back to business then, then we’ll think about that later.” We’re just sitting ducks for the next one.  

“那我们先回到正题吧，稍后我们再考虑这个问题。”我们只是在等待下一场。

**William Hanage:** When you consider that the evolution of the virus is going to be happening all the time, I think it’s easy to see that we’re not out of the woods yet and we’re not going to be out of the woods for quite some time.  

威廉·哈内奇（William Hanage）：当你考虑到病毒的进化将一直在发生时，我认为很容易看出我们还没有脱离困境，而且我们不会在很长一段时间内脱离困境。相当一段时间了。  

Exactly how long? That’s up to us on how we handle the virus.  

具体多长时间？这取决于我们如何处理病毒。

**Jonna Mazet:** The biggest obstacle to keeping us safe is our own desire to put this in the rear-view mirror.  

Jonna Mazet：确保我们安全的最大障碍是我们自己希望将其置于后视镜中。  

Human behavior and the way that we have evolved our systems is what’s in the way, and it’s no small task to break down those silos and to find all the virus, but it absolutely can be done.  

人类行为和我们进化系统的方式是障碍，打破这些孤岛并找到所有病毒并不是一项小任务，但这绝对是可以完成的。  

And we are the people — I mean, all of us watching this are the people — who can make that happen, because we say we care and we want to be protected.  

我们是能够实现这一目标的人——我的意思是，我们所有观看这一切的人都是能够实现这一目标的人，因为我们说我们关心并且我们希望受到保护。

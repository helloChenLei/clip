### Hone your technical chops  

磨练你的技术能力

Demonstrating a solid technical foundation is paramount for the next step in your career.  

展示坚实的技术基础对于您职业生涯的下一步至关重要。  

It’s critical to master the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and software development practices, and to focus on writing clean and maintainable code that follows best practices for testing, performance optimization, and scalability.  

掌握编程、数据结构、算法和软件开发实践的基础知识，并专注于编写遵循测试、性能优化和可扩展性最佳实践的干净且可维护的代码至关重要。  

However, being a strong software developer only gets you so far: To be successful, your peers, manager, and sponsors must also recognize the quality of your work and your ability to design and develop solutions to complex problems. Documenting your success via merged pull requests can help provide evidence of your applied knowledge (these can also be included in your brag doc, which we will discuss later).  

然而，成为一名强大的软件开发人员只能让你走这么远：为了取得成功，你的同事、经理和赞助商也必须认识到你的工作质量以及你设计和开发复杂问题解决方案的能力。通过合并拉取请求记录您的成功可以帮助提供您应用知识的证据（这些也可以包含在您的吹牛文档中，我们将在稍后讨论）。

Senior engineers often differentiate themselves by demonstrating leadership capabilities (understanding how your work fits into the larger goals of the business, adding value in meetings, mentoring peers, etc.) and a willingness to tie their work to business priorities and outcomes.  

高级工程师通常通过展示领导能力（了解您的工作如何适应更大的业务目标、在会议中增加价值、指导同事等）以及将工作与业务优先事项和结果联系起来的意愿来使自己脱颖而出。  

Candidates for senior engineering positions should be adept at identifying areas for incremental improvement and at efficiently managing critical service outages by utilizing team resources to quickly minimize adverse effects on customers.  

高级工程职位的候选人应善于识别需要增量改进的领域，并善于利用团队资源来有效管理关键服务中断，以快速减少对客户的不利影响。

**Connect the dots between engineering and revenue

充分了解您的业务领域将帮助您了解您正在解决的问题、您的工作如何影响公司以及如何识别和选择任务。  

Consistently delivering high-quality work is key to demonstrating your ability to meet or exceed expectations.  

始终如一地交付高质量的工作是展示您达到或超越期望的能力的关键。

If you want to move up in a company, you need a deep understanding of how the engineering logic interacts with your company’s business logic.  

如果你想在公司晋升，你需要深入了解工程逻辑如何与公司的业务逻辑交互。  

In other words, how are these technologies connected to revenue?  

换句话说，这些技术与收入有何联系？  

A company that primarily earns income through advertising will approach engineering decisions differently than one that relies on a subscription model.  

主要通过广告赚取收入的公司的工程决策方式与依赖订阅模式的公司不同。  

Understanding this will help you choose where to develop your skills.  

了解这一点将帮助您选择在哪里发展您的技能。

**Demonstrate your understanding  

展示你的理解**

There are various ways to demonstrate your understanding of the business domain and your leadership potential.  

有多种方法可以展示您对业务领域的理解和领导潜力。  

One is to identify opportunities for incremental improvements by closely examining the current processes and finding ways to streamline them.  

一是通过仔细检查当前流程并找到简化流程的方法来确定渐进式改进的机会。  

You can also create user stories, which will help highlight user needs that can then be used to improve the product.  

您还可以创建用户故事，这将有助于突出用户需求，然后用于改进产品。  

Teaming up in code reviews offers an opportunity to provide your team members with constructive feedback and show your ability to lead and collaborate effectively.

### Communicate like a product owner  

像产品负责人一样沟通

Effective communication and collaboration skills are essential for junior software engineers aiming to progress to senior roles.  

对于想要晋升为高级职位的初级软件工程师来说，有效的沟通和协作技能至关重要。  

As you advance in your career, you will be expected to work with cross-functional teams, manage projects, and communicate technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders.  

随着您职业生涯的进步，您将需要与跨职能团队合作、管理项目并向非技术利益相关者传达技术解决方案。  

You also need to know how to communicate to an executive audience (your bosses), which means you need to have clear, concise messaging that focuses on the bottom line.  

您还需要知道如何与高管受众（您的老板）沟通，这意味着您需要以清晰、简洁的方式传达重点关注的信息。  

Also, lean into your expertise so you can have an impact on the technical outcomes during meetings.  

此外，利用您的专业知识，以便您可以在会议期间对技术成果产生影响。  

For example, when a client recently asked for more control of their profanity filter beyond what their serverless tools offered, I built a customizable profanity filter that they could add new words to via an array.  

例如，当客户最近要求对其无服务器工具提供的脏话过滤器进行更多控制时，我构建了一个可定制的脏话过滤器，他们可以通过数组添加新单词。

**Volunteer to mentor and onboard new hires  

自愿指导新员工并入职**

As a mentor, you can help new team members quickly adapt to their role, offer them guidance and support, and create a friendly environment that encourages personal growth and learning.  

作为导师，您可以帮助新团队成员快速适应自己的角色，为他们提供指导和支持，并创造一个鼓励个人成长和学习的友好环境。  

Being a mentor not only highlights your ability to work well with others but also showcases your strong communication skills.  

作为导师不仅突显了您与他人良好合作的能力，还展示了您强大的沟通技巧。

At the same time, you need a council of your own sponsors and mentors to help you master complex skills, access growth opportunities within the company, and gain the visibility you need to be promoted.  

与此同时，您需要一个由自己的赞助商和导师组成的委员会来帮助您掌握复杂的技能，获得公司内部的成长机会，并获得晋升所需的知名度。  

This is very important, as you won’t be able to reach these goals alone. Just remember to “[lift as you climb](https://github.com/readme/stories/cassidy-williams),” as my friend Cassidy Williams says.  

这非常重要，因为您无法独自实现这些目标。正如我的朋友卡西迪·威廉姆斯所说，请记住“在攀登时要举起”。

**Write documentation 编写文档**

As you progress into a senior role, you’ll need to set an example of effective communication and collaboration for junior engineers.  

当您晋升为高级职位时，您需要为初级工程师树立有效沟通和协作的榜样。  

Writing clear and concise documentation displays your dedication to ensuring that information is communicated effectively and consistently.  

撰写清晰简洁的文档显示了您致力于确保有效且一致地传达信息的奉献精神。  

Good documentation not only adds an important layer of technical security to the team, it also saves time, prevents errors, and provides a reference for team members and non-technical stakeholders.  

良好的文档不仅为团队增加了重要的技术安全层，还可以节省时间、防止错误，并为团队成员和非技术利益相关者提供参考。  

Not to mention, writing documentation also shows that you’re willing to take on the tasks that others might be less willing to do, which is the mark of a team player.  

更不用说，编写文档还表明你愿意承担别人可能不太愿意做的任务，这是团队合作者的标志。

### Continue learning 继续学习

As you’ve likely already experienced, the technology world changes quickly, and you need to continue learning and developing your skills to stay up to date with the industry.  

正如您可能已经经历过的那样，技术世界瞬息万变，您需要继续学习和发展您的技能，以跟上行业的最新动态。  

To position yourself for a successful transition to a senior role, showcase high-quality work based on those learnings to leadership  

为了让自己成功过渡到高级职位，向领导者展示基于这些学习的高质量工作

Stay current by attending industry events, engaging in technical communities (such as GitHub, Stack Overflow, or HackerNews), and connecting with fellow professionals.  

通过参加行业活动、参与技术社区（例如 GitHub、Stack Overflow 或 HackerNews）以及与专业人士交流来了解最新动态。  

Beyond networking, these communities provide an opportunity to externally promote your team's accomplishments, which demonstrates to senior colleagues your commitment to the company's direction.  

除了网络之外，这些社区还提供了一个从外部宣传团队成就的机会，这向高级同事展示了您对公司方向的承诺。

Finally, remember that career progression takes time and dedication. You must be patient, persistent, and willing to do the work required to succeed.  

最后，请记住，职业发展需要时间和奉献精神。你必须有耐心、坚持不懈，并愿意做成功所需的工作。  

Advancing from junior to senior engineer requires technical expertise, leadership, project ownership, effective communication, collaboration, business domain comprehension, high performance, and innovative thinking.  

从初级工程师晋升到高级工程师需要技术专业知识、领导力、项目所有权、有效沟通、协作、业务领域理解、高性能和创新思维。  

You’ve got this. 你已经得到了这个。

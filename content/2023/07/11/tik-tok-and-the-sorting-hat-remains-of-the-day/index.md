I often describe myself as a cultural determinist, more as a way to differentiate myself from people with other dominant worldviews, though I am not a strict adherent.  

我经常将自己描述为文化决定论者，更多地是为了将自己与其他主流世界观的人区分开来，尽管我并不是严格的追随者。  

It’s more that in many situations when people ascribe causal power to something other than culture, I’m immediately suspicious.  

更重要的是，在很多情况下，当人们将因果力量归因于文化以外的其他事物时，我立即感到怀疑。

The 2010’s were a fascinating time to follow the consumer tech industry in China.  

2010 年代是追踪中国消费科技行业的绝佳时期。  

Though I left Hulu in 2011, I still kept in touch with a lot of the team from our satellite Hulu Beijing office, many of whom scattered out to various Chinese tech companies throughout the past decade.  

尽管我在 2011 年离开了 Hulu，但我仍然与 Hulu 北京办事处的许多团队成员保持着联系，其中许多人在过去十年中分散到了不同的中国科技公司。

On my last visit to the Hulu Beijing office in 2011, I was skeptical any of the new tech companies out of China would ever crack the U.S. market.

  

2011 年，我上次访问 Hulu 北京办事处时，我对中国的任何一家新技术公司能否打入美国市场表示怀疑。

It wasn’t just that the U.S. had strong incumbents, or that the Chinese tech companies were still in their infancy.  

这不仅是因为美国拥有强大的现有企业，也因为中国科技公司仍处于起步阶段。  

My default hypothesis was that what I call the veil of cultural ignorance was too impenetrable a barrier. That companies from non-[WEIRD](https://amzn.to/33iA8aY) countries (Joseph Henrich shorthand for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) would struggle to ship into WEIRD cultures.  

我的默认假设是，我所说的文化无知之幕是一个难以逾越的障碍。来自非 WEIRD 国家（约瑟夫·亨里奇是西方、受过教育、工业化、富裕和民主的简写）的公司将很难进入 WEIRD 文化。  

I was even skeptical of the reverse, of U.S. companies competing in China or India.  

我什至对相反的情况，即美国公司在中国或印度的竞争持怀疑态度。  

The further the cultural distance between two countries, the more challenging it would be for companies in one to compete in the other.  

两国之间的文化距离越远，一个国家的公司在另一个国家竞争就越困难。  

The path towards overcoming that seemed to lie in hiring a local leadership team, or sending someone over from the U.S. who understood the culture of that country inside-out.  

克服这一问题的途径似乎在于聘请当地的领导团队，或者从美国派出一个从内到外了解该国文化的人。

For the most part, that has held true. China has struggled, for the most part, to make real inroads in the U.S. WeChat tried to make inroads in the U.S. but only really managed to capture Chinese-Americans who used the app to communicate with friends, family, and business colleagues in China.  

在大多数情况下，这是正确的。在很大程度上，中国一直在努力在美国取得真正的进展。微信试图在美国取得进展，但只是真正成功地抓住了使用该应用程序与中国的朋友、家人和商业同事沟通的华裔美国人。

In the other direction, the U.S. hasn’t made a huge dent in China. Obviously, the Great Firewall played a huge role in keeping a lot of U.S. companies out of the Chinese market, but in the few cases where a U.S. company got a crack at the Chinese market, like Uber China, the results were mixed.  

另一方面，美国并没有对中国造成太大影响。显然，防火墙在阻止许多美国公司进入中国市场方面发挥了巨大作用，但在少数美国公司进入中国市场的案例中，比如Uber中国，结果好坏参半。

For this reason, I’ve been fascinated with TikTok. Here in 2020, TikTok is, for many, including myself, the most entertaining short video app going. The U.S. government is considering banning the app as a national security risk, and while that’s the topic du jour for just about everyone right now, I’m much more interested in tracing how it got a foothold in markets outside of China, especially the U.S. with its powerful incumbents.  

因此，我对 TikTok 着迷。 2020 年，对于包括我在内的许多人来说，TikTok 是最有趣的短视频应用程序。美国政府正在考虑以国家安全风险为由禁止该应用程序，虽然这是现在几乎每个人的热门话题，但我更感兴趣的是追踪它如何在中国以外的市场（尤其是美国）站稳脚跟。及其强大的现任者。

They say you learn the most from failure, and in the same way I learn the most about my mental models from the exceptions.  

他们说你从失败中学到最多，同样，我从例外中学到最多关于我的思维模式的知识。  

How did an app designed by two guys in Shanghai managed to run circles around U.S. video apps from YouTube to Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat, becoming the most fertile source for meme origination, mutation, and dissemination in a culture so different from the one in which it was built?  

一款由两个上海人设计的应用程序是如何成功地围绕着从 YouTube 到 Facebook 到 Instagram 到 Snapchat 的美国视频应用程序，在一个与美国文化如此不同的文化中成为模因起源、变异和传播的最丰富的来源。它被建造了吗？

The answer, I believe, has significant implications for the future of cross-border tech competition, as well as for understanding how product developers achieve product-market-fit.  

我相信，这个答案对于跨境技术竞争的未来以及了解产品开发人员如何实现产品与市场的契合具有重大意义。  

The rise of TikTok updated my thinking. It turns out that in some categories, **a machine learning algorithm significantly responsive and accurate can pierce the veil of cultural ignorance**. Today, sometimes **culture can be abstracted**.  

TikTok的兴起更新了我的思维。事实证明，在某些类别中，具有显着响应能力和准确度的机器学习算法可以揭开文化无知的面纱。今天，有时文化可以被抽象化。

___

TikTok's story begins in 2014, in Shanghai. Alex Zhu and Luyu “Louis” Yang had launched an educational short-form video app that hadn’t gotten any traction.  

TikTok 的故事始于 2014 年的上海。 Alex Zhu 和 Luyu “Louis” Yang 推出了一款教育短视频应用程序，但没有引起任何关注。  

They decided to pivot to lip-synch music videos, launching Musical.ly in the U.S. and China.  

他们决定转向假唱音乐视频，在美国和中国推出 Musical.ly。  

Ironically, the app got more traction across the Pacific Ocean, so they killed their efforts in their home country of China and focused their efforts on their American market.  

具有讽刺意味的是，该应用程序在太平洋彼岸获得了更大的吸引力，因此他们放弃了在中国的努力，并将精力集中在美国市场。

The early user base consisted mostly of American teenage girls.  

早期的用户群主要由美国少女组成。  

Finally, an app offered users the chance to lip synch to the official version of popular songs and have those videos distributed to an audience for social feedback.  

最后，一款应用程序为用户提供了与流行歌曲的官方版本进行口型同步的机会，并将这些视频分发给观众以获得社交反馈。

That the app got any traction at all was progress. However, it presented Alex, Louis, and their team with a problem.  

该应用程序获得任何关注就是进步。然而，这给亚历克斯、路易斯和他们的团队带来了一个问题。  

American teen girls were not exactly an audience Alex and Louis really understood.  

美国少女并不是亚历克斯和路易斯真正理解的观众。To be fair, most American parents would argue they don't understand their teenage daughters either.  

公平地说，大多数美国父母会说他们也不理解自己十几岁的女儿。

During this era where China and the U.S. tech scenes have overlapped, the Chinese market has been largely impenetrable to the U.S. tech companies because of the Great Firewall, both the software instance and the outright bans from the CCP.  

在这个中美科技场景重叠的时代，由于防火墙、软件实例和中共的彻底禁令，美国科技公司基本上无法进入中国市场。  

But in the reverse direction, America has been almost as impenetrable to Chinese companies because of what might be thought of as America’s cultural firewall.  

但相反，由于可能被认为是美国的文化防火墙，美国对中国企业几乎同样难以渗透。  

Outside of DJI in drones  

DJI 之外的无人机I'd argue one reason DJI had success in America was that drone control interfaces borrow heavily from standard flight control interfaces and are not culturally specific.  

我认为大疆创新在美国取得成功的原因之一是无人机控制界面大量借鉴了标准飞行控制界面，并且不具有特定的文化背景。  

Thus DJI could lean on its hardware prowess which was formidable.  

因此，大疆创新可以依靠其强大的硬件实力。, I can’t think of any Chinese app making real inroads in the U.S. prior to Musical.ly. To build on its early traction, Musical.ly would have to overcome this cultural barrier.  

，我想不出有哪个中国应用程序能在 Musical.ly 之前真正进军美国。为了巩固其早期的吸引力，Musical.ly 必须克服这种文化障碍。

It’s been said that if you ask your customers what they want, they’ll ask for a faster horse (attributed to Henry Ford, [though that may not be true](https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast)). Frankly, that’s always been half horses\*\*\*, and not just because horses are involved. First of all, what if your customers are horse jockeys?  

据说，如果你问顾客想要什么，他们会要求一匹更快的马（归功于亨利·福特，尽管这可能不是真的）。坦率地说，这一直是半马\*\*\*，不仅仅是因为涉及到马。首先，如果您的客户是骑师怎么办？

Secondly, while you can’t listen to your customers exclusively, paying attention to them is a dependable way to build a solid SaaS business, and even in the consumer space it provides useful signal.  

其次，虽然你不能只倾听客户的声音，但关注他们是建立稳固的 SaaS 业务的可靠方式，甚至在消费者领域它也提供了有用的信号。  

As I’ve written about before, customers may tell you they want a faster horse, and what you should hear is not that you should be injecting your horses with steroids but that your customers find their current mode of transportation, the aforementioned horse, to be too slow a means of getting around.  

正如我之前写过的，顾客可能会告诉你他们想要一匹更快的马，你应该听到的不是你应该给你的马注射类固醇，而是你的顾客发现他们当前的交通方式，前面提到的马，出行方式太慢。

Alex and Louis listened to Musical.ly’s early adopters.  

Alex 和 Louis 听取了 Musical.ly 早期采用者的意见。  

The app made feedback channels easy to find, and the American teenage girls using the app every day were more than willing to speak up about what they wanted to ease their video creation.  

该应用程序使反馈渠道很容易找到，每天使用该应用程序的美国少女非常愿意说出她们想要简化视频创作的内容。  

They sent a ton of product requests, helping to inform a product roadmap for the Musical.ly team.  

他们发送了大量的产品请求，帮助为 Musical.ly 团队制定产品路线图。  

That, combined with some clever growth hacks, like allowing watermarked videos to easily be downloaded and distributed via other networks like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, helped them achieve hockey-stick inflection among their target market.  

再加上一些巧妙的增长技巧，例如允许通过 YouTube、Facebook 和 Instagram 等其他网络轻松下载和分发带水印的视频，帮助他们在目标市场中实现了曲棍球棒式的变化。

Still, Musical.ly ran into its [invisible asymptote](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes) eventually. There are only so many teenage girls in the U.S. When they saturated that market, usage and growth flatlined.  

尽管如此，Musical.ly 最终还是遇到了看不见的渐近线。美国的少女数量有限，当市场饱和时，使用量和增长就会趋于平缓。  

It was then that a suitor they had rebuffed previously, the Chinese technology company Bytedance, suddenly looked more attractive, like Professor Bhaer to Jo March at the end of Little Women.  

就在那时，他们之前拒绝的追求者——中国科技公司字节跳动——突然显得更具吸引力，就像《小妇人》结尾处的巴尔教授对乔·马奇一样。  

In a bit of dramatic irony, Bytedance had cloned Musical.ly in China with an app called Douyin, one that had taken off in China, and now Bytedance was buying the app that inspired it, Musical.ly, an app conceived and built in China but that had failed in China and instead gotten traction in the U.S.  

颇具戏剧性讽刺的是，字节跳动在中国克隆了 Musical.ly，推出了一款名为抖音的应用程序，该应用程序在中国取得了巨大成功，而现在字节跳动又收购了启发它的应用程序 Musical.ly，这是一款在中国设计和构建的应用程序。中国，但这在中国失败了，反而在美国受到关注。

After the purchase, Bytedance rebranded Musical.ly as TikTok.  

收购后，字节跳动将 Musical.ly 更名为 TikTok。  

Still, if that’s all they had done, it’s not clear why the app would’ve broken out of its stalled growth to the stunning extent it has under its new owner.  

不过，如果这就是他们所做的一切，我们还不清楚为什么该应用程序会在新主人的领导下摆脱停滞的增长，达到令人惊叹的程度。  

After all, Bytedance paid just $1B for an app that’s rumored to sell now, if the U.S. government approves the transaction, for anywhere from $30 to $70B.  

毕竟，字节跳动只花了 1B 美元购买了一款应用程序，据传如果美国政府批准这笔交易，现在该应用程序的售价将从 30 美元到 70B 美元不等。

Bytedance did two things in particular to jumpstart TikTok’s growth.  

为了推动 TikTok 的增长，字节跳动特别做了两件事。

First, it opened up its wallet and started spending on user acquisition in the U.S. the way wealthy Chinese used to spend on American real estate (no, I’m not still bitter at all the Chinese all-cash offers that trounced me repeatedly when condo-hunting six years ago).  

首先，它打开了钱包，开始在美国收购用户，就像中国富有的人过去在美国房地产上花钱一样（不，我还没有对中国的全现金优惠感到痛苦，这些优惠在购买公寓时多次让我感到沮丧） -六年前狩猎）。  

TikTok was rumored to have been spending a staggering eight or nine figures a month on advertising.  

据传 TikTok 每月在广告上的支出高达八九位数，令人震惊。

The ubiquity of TikTok ads lent the theory credence. I saw TikTok ads everywhere, on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and in mobile games  

TikTok 广告的无处不在为这一理论提供了可信度。我在 YouTube、Instagram、Twitter、Facebook 和手机游戏中到处都看到了 TikTok 广告TikTok ads are bizarre. The video ads I see for the app in mobile games convey nothing about what the app is or does.  

TikTok 的广告很奇怪。我在手机游戏中看到的该应用程序的视频广告没有传达任何关于该应用程序是什么或做什么的信息。  

One ad I've seen dozens of times has an old lady doing lunges in her living room, another has a kid blow drying his hair, and as he does, his hair changes colors.  

我看过几十次的一则广告中，一位老太太在她的客厅里做弓箭步，另一则广告中一个孩子吹干头发，当他吹干头发时，他的头发变色了。  

I feel like the ads could do a better job of selling the app, but what do I know?  

我觉得广告可以更好地销售应用程序，但我知道什么？. If Bytedance could have purchased ads on the back of my eyelids at sub $20 CPMs I don’t doubt they would have done so.  

。如果字节跳动能以低于 20 美元的每千次展示费用在我的眼睑后面购买广告，我毫不怀疑他们会这样做。

It didn’t look like a wise investment at first. Rumors abounded that the 30-day retention of all those new users poured into the top of its funnel was sub 10%.  

乍一看，这似乎不是一项明智的投资。有传言称，所有涌入其渠道顶部的新用户的 30 天留存率低于 10%。  

They seemed to be lighting ad dollars on fire.  

他们似乎正在点燃广告费用。

Ultimately, the ROI on that spend would turn the corner, but only because of the second element of their assault on the US market, the most important piece of technology Bytedance introduced to TikTok: the updated For You Page feed algorithm.  

最终，这笔支出的投资回报率将会出现好转，但这只是因为他们进军美国市场的第二个要素，即字节跳动向 TikTok 引入的最重要的技术：更新的 For You Page feed 算法。

Bytedance has an absurd proportion of their software engineers focused on their algorithms, more than half at last check.  

字节跳动的软件工程师专注于算法的比例高得离谱，根据上次检查，这一比例超过了一半。  

It is known as the algorithm company, first for its breakout algorithmic “news” app Toutiao, then for its Musical.ly clone Douyin, and now for TikTok.  

它被称为算法公司，首先是因为其突破性的算法“新闻”应用程序今日头条，然后是其Musical.ly克隆版抖音，现在是TikTok。

Prior to TikTok, I would’ve said YouTube had the strongest exploit algorithm in video,  

在 TikTok 之前，我会说 YouTube 拥有视频领域最强的漏洞利用算法，The exploit versus explore conundrum is sort of a classic of algorithmic design, usually mentioned in relation to the multi-armed bandit problem.  

漏洞利用与探索难题是一种经典的算法设计，通常在与多臂老虎机问题相关时提到。  

For the purposes of this discussion, think of it simply as the problem of choosing which videos to show you.  

出于本次讨论的目的，可以将其简单地视为选择向您展示哪些视频的问题。  

An exploit algorithm will give you more of what you like, while an explore algorithm tries to broaden your exposure to more than just what you’ve shown you like.  

漏洞利用算法将为您提供更多您喜欢的内容，而探索算法则试图扩大您的曝光范围，而不仅仅是您所展示的喜欢的内容。  

YouTube is often described as an exploit algorithm because it tends to really push more of what you like, and then before you know it, you’re looking at some alt-right video that’s trying to redpill you.  

YouTube 通常被描述为一种利用算法，因为它往往会真正推送更多您喜欢的内容，然后在您意识到之前，您正在观看一些试图让您红丸的另类右翼视频。 but in comparison to TikTok, YouTube’s algorithm feels primitive (the top creators on YouTube have long ago figured out how to game YouTube’s algorithm’s heavy dependence on click-through rates and watch time, one reason so many YouTube videos are lengthening over time, much to my dismay).  

但与 TikTok 相比，YouTube 的算法感觉很原始（YouTube 上的顶级创作者很早就想出了如何应对 YouTube 算法对点击率和观看时间的严重依赖，这也是许多 YouTube 视频随着时间的推移而变长的原因之一，我的沮丧）。

Before Bytedance bought Musical.ly and rebranded it TikTok, its Musical.ly clone called Douyin was already a sensation in the Chinese market thanks in large part to its effective algorithm.  

在字节跳动收购 Musical.ly 并将其更名为 TikTok 之前，它的 Musical.ly 克隆版抖音已经在中国市场引起轰动，这在很大程度上要归功于其有效的算法。  

A few years ago, on a visit to Beijing, I caught up with a bunch of former colleagues from Hulu Beijing, and all of them showed me their Douyin feeds.  

几年前，在北京访问时，我遇到了一群 Hulu 北京的前同事，他们都向我展示了他们的抖音动态。  

They described the app as frighteningly addictive and the algorithm as eerily perceptive.  

他们形容该应用程序非常容易上瘾，而算法则具有惊人的洞察力。  

More than one of them said they had to delete the app off their phone for months at a time because they were losing an hour or two every night just lying in bed watching videos.  

其中不止一个人表示，他们不得不一次从手机上删除该应用程序几个月，因为他们每晚躺在床上看视频就会损失一两个小时。

That same trip, I had coffee with an ex-Hulu developer who now was now a senior exec in the Bytedance engineering organization.  

同一次旅行中，我与一位前 Hulu 开发人员喝了咖啡，他现在是字节跳动工程组织的高级管理人员。  

Of course, he was tight-lipped about how their algorithm worked, but the scale of their infrastructure dedicated to their algorithms was clear.  

当然，他对他们的算法如何工作守口如瓶，但专用于算法的基础设施的规模是显而易见的。  

On my way in and out of this office, just one of several Bytedance spaces all across the city, I gawked at hundreds of workers sitting side by side in row after row in the open floorplan.  

在我进出这间办公室的路上，这间办公室只是整个城市的几个字节跳动空间之一，我呆呆地看着数百名员工并排坐在开放式平面图中一排又一排。  

It resembled what I’d seen at tech giants like Facebook in the U.S., but even denser.  

它类似于我在美国 Facebook 等科技巨头看到的情况，但更密集。The mood was giddy. I could tell he was doing well. He took me and my friends to a Luckin Coffee in their office basement and told us to order drinks off an app on his phone.  

心情是晕眩的。我看得出来他做得很好。他带我和我的朋友去了他们办公室地下室的瑞幸咖啡，并告诉我们通过他手机上的应用程序点饮料。  

I reached in my pocket for some RMB to pay for the drinks and he put his hand on my arm to stop me. “Don’t worry, I can afford this,” he said, laughing.  

我伸手从口袋里掏出一些人民币来付酒钱，他把手放在我的手臂上阻止我。他笑着说：“别担心，我负担得起。”  

He didn’t mean it in a boasting manner, he seemed almost sheepish about how well they were doing.  

他并不是自吹自擂，他似乎对他们的表现感到羞愧。  

Afterwards, as we waited outside the office in their parking lot, he walked past and asked me if I needed a ride. No, I said, I’d be taking the subway.  

后来，当我们在办公室外面的停车场等车时，他走过来问我是否需要搭车。不，我说，我要坐地铁。  

A Tesla Model X pulled up, the valet hopped out, and he jumped in and drove off.  

一辆特斯拉 Model X 停了下来，服务员跳下车，他跳上车开走了。

It’s rumored that Bytedance examines more features of videos than other companies. If you like a video featuring video game captures, that is noted.  

据传，字节跳动比其他公司检查更多的视频特征。如果您喜欢包含视频游戏捕获的视频，请注意。  

If you like videos featuring puppies, that is noted. Every Douyin feed I examined was distinctive.  

如果您喜欢以小狗为主题的视频，请注意。我查看的每个抖音信息都各具特色。  

My friends all noted that after spending only a short amount of time in the app, it had locked onto their palate.  

我的朋友们都注意到，在应用程序中只花了很短的时间后，它就锁定了他们的口味。

That, more than anything else, was the critical upgrade Bytedance applied to Musical.ly to turn it into TikTok.  

最重要的是，字节跳动对 Musical.ly 进行了关键升级，将其转变为 TikTok。  

Friends at Bytedance claimed, with some pride, that after they plugged Musical.ly, now TikTok, into Bytedance’s back-end algorithm, they doubled the time spent in the app.  

字节跳动的朋友自豪地声称，在他们将 Musical.ly（现在的 TikTok）插入字节跳动的后端算法后，他们在应用程序上花费的时间增加了一倍。  

I was skeptical until I asked some friends who had some data on the before and after. The step change in the graph was anything but subtle.  

我对此表示怀疑，直到我询问了一些有前后数据的朋友。图表中的阶跃变化一点也不微妙。

At the time Musical.ly got renamed TikTok, it was still dominated by teen girls doing lip synch videos. Many U.S. teens at the time described TikTok as “cringey,” usually a kiss of death for networks looking to expand among youths, fickle as they are about what’s cool.  

当 Musical.ly 更名为 TikTok 时，它仍然以制作对口型视频的少女为主。当时，许多美国青少年将 TikTok 描述为“令人畏惧”，对于那些希望在年轻人中扩张的网络来说，这通常是一个死亡之吻，因为他们对什么很酷的东西反复无常。  

Scrolling the app at the time felt like eavesdropping on the theater kids clique from high school. Entertaining, but hardly a mainstream entertainment staple.  

当时滚动应用程序感觉就像是在偷听高中戏剧孩子们的表演。有趣，但很难成为主流娱乐主食。

That’s where the one-two combination of Bytedance’s enormous marketing spend and the power of TikTok’s algorithm came to the rescue.  

这就是字节跳动巨额营销支出和 TikTok 强大算法的一对二组合发挥作用的地方。  

To help a network break out from its early adopter group, you need both to bring lots of new people/subcultures into the app—that’s where the massive marketing spend helps—but also ways to help these disparate groups to 1) find each other quickly and 2) branch off into their own spaces.  

为了帮助网络从早期采用者群体中脱颖而出，您不仅需要将大量新人/亚文化带入应用程序（这就是巨额营销支出所发挥作用的地方），还需要帮助这些不同群体 1) 快速找到彼此2）分支到自己的空间。

More than any other feed algorithm I can recall, Bytedance’s short video algorithm fulfilled these two requirements. It is a rapid, hyper-efficient matchmaker.  

字节跳动的短视频算法比我记得的任何其他 feed 算法都更能满足这两个要求。它是一个快速、高效的媒人。  

Merely by watching some videos, and without having to follow or friend anyone, you can quickly train TikTok on what you like.  

只需观看一些视频，无需关注或加好友，您就可以快速训练 TikTok 进行您喜欢的内容。  

In the two sided entertainment network that is TikTok, the algorithm acts as a rapid, efficient market maker, connecting videos with the audiences they’re destined to delight.  

在 TikTok 等双向娱乐网络中，算法充当快速、高效的做市商，将视频与它们注定要取悦的观众联系起来。  

The algorithm allows this to happen **without an explicit follower graph**.  

该算法允许在没有明确的追随者图的情况下发生这种情况。

Just as importantly, by personalizing everyone’s FYP feeds, TikTok helped to keep these distinct subcultures, with their different tastes, separated.  

同样重要的是，通过个性化每个人的 FYP feed，TikTok 帮助将这些具有不同品味的独特亚文化区分开来。  

One person’s cringe is another person’s pleasure, but figuring out which is which is no small feat.  

一个人的畏缩是另一个人的快乐，但弄清楚哪个是哪个不是一件小事。

TikTok’s algorithm is the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter universe.  

TikTok 的算法是哈利波特宇宙中的分院帽。  

Just as that magical hat sorts students at Hogwarts into the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin houses, TikTok’s algorithm sorts its users into dozens and dozens of subcultures  

正如那顶神奇的帽子将霍格沃茨的学生分为格兰芬多学院、赫奇帕奇学院、拉文克劳学院和斯莱特林学院一样，TikTok 的算法将其用户分为数十种亚文化The Sorting Hat is perhaps the most curious plot device from the Harry Potter universe. Is it a metaphor for genetic determinism? Did Draco have any hope of not being a Slytherin?  

分院帽也许是哈利·波特宇宙中最奇怪的情节装置。这是遗传决定论的隐喻吗？德拉科有希望不成为斯莱特林吗？  

By sorting Draco into that house, did it shape his destiny? Is the hat a metaphor for the U.S. college admissions system, with all its known biases?  

把德拉科分进那所房子，这是否决定了他的命运？这顶帽子是对美国大学招生制度及其所有已知偏见的隐喻吗？  

Is Harry Potter, sorted into Gryffindor, a legacy admit?  

哈利·波特被分入格兰芬多是一个遗产承认吗？. Not two FYP feeds are alike.  

。没有两个 FYP Feed 是相同的。

For all the naive and idealistic dreams of the so-called “marketplace of ideas,” the first generation of large social networks has proven mostly unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with the resulting culture wars.  

尽管所谓的“思想市场”的所有天真和理想主义梦想，事实证明，第一代大型社交网络大多没有做好准备，也没有能力应对由此产生的文化战争。  

Until they have some real substantial ideas and incentives to take on the costly task of mediating between strangers who disagree with each other, they’re better off sorting those people apart.  

除非他们有一些真正实质性的想法和动力来承担在彼此意见不一致的陌生人之间进行调解的昂贵任务，否则他们最好将这些人分开。  

The only types of people who enjoy being thrown into a gladiatorial online arena together with those they disagree with seem to be trolls, who benefit asymmetrically from the resultant violence.  

唯一喜欢与自己不同意的人一起投入在线角斗场的人似乎是巨魔，他们从由此产生的暴力中获得不对称的利益。

Consider Twitter's content moderation problems. How much of that results from throwing liberals and conservatives together in a timeline together?  

考虑一下 Twitter 的内容审核问题。其中有多少是由于将自由派和保守派放在一起而产生的？  

Twitter employees speak often about wanting to improve public discourse, but they’d be much better off (and society, too) keeping the Slytherins and Gryffindors apart until they have some real substantive ideas to solve the problem of low trust conversation.  

Twitter 员工经常谈论想要改善公共话语，但他们（以及社会）最好将斯莱特林和格兰芬多分开，直到他们有一些真正的实质性想法来解决低信任对话的问题。The same can be said of NextDoor and their problem of racist reporting of minorities just walking down the sidewalk. They’d be better off just removing that feature.  

NextDoor 也存在同样的情况，他们对走在人行道上的少数族裔进行种族主义报道。他们最好删除该功能。  

At some point, NextDoor needs to face the fact that they aren’t going to solve racism.  

在某些时候，NextDoor 需要面对这样一个事实：他们不会解决种族主义问题。  

Tweak that feature all you want, put up all the hoops for users to jump through to file such a report, but adverse selection ensures that those most motivated to jump through them are the racist ones.  

你可以随心所欲地调整这个功能，设置所有的障碍让用户跳过这些障碍来提交这样的报告，但逆向选择确保了那些最有动力跳过这些障碍的人是种族主义者。

After some time, new subcultures did indeed emerge on TikTok. No longer was it just teenage girls lip-synching. There are [so many subcultures on TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/style/elite-tiktok.html) I can barely track them because I only ever see a portion of them in my personalized FYP. This broadened TikTok’s appeal and total addressable market.  

一段时间后，TikTok 上确实出现了新的亚文化。不再只是十几岁的女孩对口型。 TikTok 上有太多的亚文化，我几乎无法追踪它们，因为我只在我的个性化 FYP 中看到过其中的一部分。这扩大了 TikTok 的吸引力和总目标市场。  

Douyin had followed that path in China, so Bytedance at least had some precedent for committing to such an expensive bet, but I wasn’t certain if it would work in the U.S., a much more competitive media and entertainment market.  

抖音在中国就走的是这条路，所以字节跳动至少有一些做出如此昂贵的赌注的先例，但我不确定它是否会在美国这个竞争更加激烈的媒体和娱乐市场发挥作用。

Within a larger social network, even subcultures need some minimum viable scale, and though Bytedance paid dearly to fill the top of the funnel, its algorithm eventually helped assemble many subcultures surpassing that minimum viable scale.  

在更大的社交网络中，即使是亚文化也需要一定的最小可行规模，尽管字节跳动为填补漏斗顶部付出了高昂的代价，但其算法最终帮助聚集了许多超过最小可行规模的亚文化。  

More notably, it did so with amazing speed.  

更值得注意的是，它以惊人的速度做到了这一点。

Think of how most other social networks have scaled. The usual path is organic.  

想想大多数其他社交网络是如何扩展的。通常的路径是有机的。  

Users are encouraged to follow and friend each other to assemble their own graph one connection at a time.  

我们鼓励用户互相关注并加好友，一次一个连接地组装自己的图表。  

The challenge with that is that it’s almost always a really slow build, and you have to provide some reason for people to hang around and build that graph, often encapsulated by the aphorism “[come for the tool, stay for the network](https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network).” Today, it’s not as easy to build the “tool” part when so much of that landscape has already been mined and when scaled networks have learned to copy any tool achieving any level of traction.  

这样做的挑战在于，它的构建几乎总是非常缓慢，并且您必须为人们提供一些理由来构建该图，通常用格言“来找工具，留下来网络”来概括。如今，当大部分景观已经被挖掘并且规模化网络已经学会复制任何工具以实现任何程度的吸引力时，构建“工具”部分并不那么容易。In the West, Facebook is the master of the fast follow.  

在西方，Facebook是快速关注的大师。  

They struggle to launch new social graphs of their own invention, but if they spot any competing social network achieve any level of traction, they will lock down and ship a clone with blinding speed.  

他们努力推出自己发明的新社交图谱，但如果他们发现任何竞争的社交网络达到任何程度的吸引力，他们就会锁定并以惊人的速度发布克隆。  

Good artists borrow, great artists steal, the best artists steal the most quickly?  

好的艺术家借，伟大的艺术家偷，最好的艺术家偷得最快？  

Facebook as a competitor reminds me of that class of zombies in movies that stagger around drunk most of the time, but the moment they spot a target, they sprint at it like a pack of cheetahs.  

Facebook作为竞争对手让我想起了电影里的那种僵尸，他们大部分时间都喝得醉醺醺的，但一旦发现目标，就会像一群猎豹一样冲向目标。  

The type you see in 28 Days Later and I Am Legend. Terrifying.  

你在《惊变 28 天》和《我是传奇》中看到的类型。太可怕了。

Some people still think that a new social network will be built around a new content format, but it’s almost impossible to think of a format that couldn’t be copied in two to three months by a compact Facebook team put in lockdown with catered dinners.  

有些人仍然认为新的社交网络将围绕新的内容格式构建，但几乎不可能想到一种格式不能被一个紧凑的 Facebook 团队在两到三个月内复制，并提供餐饮服务。  

Yes, a new content format might create a new proof of work, as I wrote about in [Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service), but just as critical is building the right structures to distribute such content to the right audience to close the social feedback loop.  

是的，新的内容格式可能会创建新的工作证明，正如我在“状态即服务”中所写的那样，但同样重要的是构建正确的结构以将此类内容分发给正确的受众以关闭社会反馈循环。

What’s the last new social network to achieve scale in recent years? You probably can’t think of any, and that’s because there really aren’t any.  

近年来最后一个达到规模的新社交网络是什么？你可能想不到，那是因为确实没有。  

Even Facebook hasn’t been able to launch any really new successful social products, and a lot of that is because they also seem fixated on building these things around some content format gimmick.  

就连 Facebook 也未能推出任何真正成功的新社交产品，很大程度上是因为他们似乎也专注于围绕某些内容格式的噱头来构建这些产品。

Recall the three purposes which I used to distinguish among networks in Status as a Service: social capital (status), entertainment, and utility.  

回想一下我在《地位即服务》中用来区分网络的三个目的：社会资本（地位）、娱乐和效用。  

In another post soon I promise to explain why I classify networks along these three axes, but for now, just know that while almost all networks serve some mix of the three, most lean heavily towards one of those three purposes.  

在另一篇文章中，我承诺解释为什么我沿着这三个轴对网络进行分类，但现在，只需知道，虽然几乎所有网络都服务于这三个轴的某种组合，但大多数网络都严重倾向于这三个目的之一。

A network like Venmo or Uber, for example, is mostly about utility: I need to pay someone money, or I need to travel from here to there.  

例如，像 Venmo 或 Uber 这样的网络主要是关于实用性的：我需要付钱给某人，或者我需要从这里到那里。  

A network like YouTube is more about entertainment. Amuse me.  

像 YouTube 这样的网络更多的是娱乐。逗我。  

And some networks, what most people refer to when they use the generic term “social network,” are more focused on social capital. Soho House, for example.  

大多数人在使用通用术语“社交网络”时所指的一些网络更关注社会资本。以苏荷楼为例。

TikTok is less a pure social network, the type focused on social capital, than an entertainment network. I don’t socialize with people on TikTok, I barely know any of them.  

TikTok 与其说是一个专注于社交资本的纯粹社交网络，不如说是一个娱乐网络。我不在 TikTok 上与人交往，我几乎不认识他们中的任何人。  

It consists of a network of people connected to each other, but they are connected for a distinct reason, for creators to reach viewers with their short videos.  

它由一个相互联系的人组成的网络组成，但他们之间的联系有一个独特的原因，即创作者可以通过他们的短视频吸引观众。Bytedance hasn't been successful in building out a social network to compete with WeChat, though it's not for lack of trying.  

字节跳动在打造社交网络来与微信竞争方面并未取得成功，但这并不是因为缺乏尝试。  

I think they have a variety of options for doing so, but as with many companies that didn't begin as social first, it's not in their DNA.  

我认为他们有多种选择来做到这一点，但正如许多最初并非以社交为先的公司一样，这并不在他们的DNA中。  

Facebook is underrated for its ability to build functional social plumbing at scale, that is a rare design skill.  

Facebook 因其大规模构建功能性社交管道的能力而被低估，这是一种罕见的设计技能。  

Companies as diverse as Amazon and Netflix have tried building social features and then later abandoned them.  

亚马逊和 Netflix 等多元化公司都曾尝试构建社交功能，但后来又放弃了。  

I suspect they tried when they didn't have enough users to create breakaway social scale, but it's difficult to imagine them pulling that off without more social DNA.  

我怀疑他们在没有足够的用户来创建突破性社交规模时尝试过，但很难想象他们在没有更多社交 DNA 的情况下实现这一目标。  

But having a social-first DNA also means that Facebook isn't great at building non-social offerings. Their video or watch tab remains a bizarre and unfocused mess.  

但拥有社交优先的 DNA 也意味着 Facebook 不擅长打造非社交产品。他们的视频或观看选项卡仍然是一个奇怪且没有重点的混乱。

One can debate the semantics of what constitutes a social network forever, but what matters here is realizing that another way to describe an entertainment network is as an interest network.  

人们可以永远争论社交网络的语义，但这里重要的是认识到描述娱乐网络的另一种方式是兴趣网络。  

TikTok takes content from one group of people and match it to other people who would enjoy that content. **It is trying to figure out what hundreds of millions of viewers around the world are interested in**. When you frame TikTok's algorithm that way, its enormous unrealized potential snaps into focus.  

TikTok 从一组人那里获取内容，并将其与其他会喜欢该内容的人进行匹配。它试图找出世界各地数亿观众感兴趣的内容。当你以这种方式构建 TikTok 的算法时，它巨大的未实现的潜力就会成为焦点。

The idea of using a social graph to build out an interest-based network has always been a sort of approximation, a hack.  

使用社交图谱构建基于兴趣的网络的想法一直是一种近似，一种黑客行为。  

You follow some people in an app, and it serves you some subset of the content from those people under the assumption that you’ll find much of what they post of interest to you.  

您在应用程序中关注了一些人，它会为您提供这些人的一些内容子集，前提是您会发现他们发布的大部分您感兴趣的内容。  

It worked in college for Facebook because a bunch of hormonal college students are really interested in each other. It worked in Twitter, eventually, though it took a while.  

它在 Facebook 的大学里发挥了作用，因为一群荷尔蒙大学生彼此真的很感兴趣。最终，它在 Twitter 上发挥了作用，尽管花了一段时间。  

Twitter's unidirectional follow graph allowed people to pick and choose who to follow with more flexibility than Facebook's initial bi-directional friend model, but Twitter didn't provide enough feedback mechanisms early on to help train its users on what to tweet.  

Twitter 的单向关注图允许人们比 Facebook 最初的双向好友模型更灵活地选择关注谁，但 Twitter 早期没有提供足够的反馈机制来帮助培训用户发推内容。  

The early days were filled with a lot of status updates of the variety people cite when criticizing social media: "nobody cares what you ate for lunch."  

早期充满了人们在批评社交媒体时引用的各种状态更新：“没人关心你午餐吃了什么。”I talk about Twitter's slow path to product market fit in [Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)  

我谈论 Twitter 在 Status as a Service 中缓慢适应产品市场的道路

But what if there was a way to build an interest graph for you without you having to follow anyone?  

但是，如果有一种方法可以为您构建兴趣图而无需您关注任何人呢？  

What if you could skip the long and painstaking intermediate step of assembling a social graph and just jump directly to the interest graph?  

如果您可以跳过组装社交图谱的漫长而艰苦的中间步骤，直接跳到兴趣图谱，会怎么样？  

And what if that could be done really quickly and cheaply at scale, across millions of users?  

如果这可以在数百万用户中快速且廉价地大规模完成，结果又会怎样呢？  

And what if the algorithm that pulled this off could also adjust to your evolving tastes in near real-time, without you having to actively tune it?  

如果实现这一目标的算法也可以近乎实时地适应您不断变化的品味，而无需您主动调整它，该怎么办？

The problem with approximating an interest graph with a social graph is that social graphs have negative network effects that kick in at scale.  

用社交图来近似兴趣图的问题在于，社交图具有大规模产生的负面网络效应。  

Take a social network like Twitter: the one-way follow graph structure is well-suited to interest graph construction, but the problem is that you’re rarely interested in everything from any single person you follow.  

以像 Twitter 这样的社交网络为例：单向关注图结构非常适合兴趣图构建，但问题是你很少对你关注的任何一个人的所有内容都感兴趣。  

You may enjoy Gruber’s thoughts on Apple but not his Yankees tweets. Or my tweets on tech but not on film. And so on.  

你可能喜欢格鲁伯对苹果的看法，但不喜欢他关于洋基队的推文。或者我关于科技但不关于电影的推文。等等。  

You can try to use Twitter Lists, or mute or block certain people or topics, but it’s all a big hassle that few have the energy or will to tackle.  

你可以尝试使用 Twitter 列表，或者静音或屏蔽某些人或话题，但这都是一个大麻烦，很少有人有精力或意愿去解决。

Think of what happened to Facebook when it’s users went from having their classmates as friends to hundreds and often thousands of people as friends, including coworkers, parents, and that random person you met at the open bar at a wedding reception and felt obligated to accept a friend request from even though their jokes didn’t seem as funny the next morning in the cold light of sobriety.  

想一想 Facebook 发生了什么，当它的用户从以同学为好友，发展到以数百甚至数千人为好友，包括同事、父母，以及你在婚宴露天酒吧遇到并觉得有义务接受的人时，Facebook 发生了什么？尽管第二天早上在清醒的冷光下他们的笑话看起来并不那么好笑，但还是收到了好友请求。  

Some have termed it context collapse, but by any name, it’s an annoyance everyone understands.  

有些人将其称为上下文崩溃，但无论以何种名称，这都是每个人都能理解的烦恼。  

It manifests itself in the declining visit and posting frequency on Facebook across many cohorts.  

这体现在许多群体在 Facebook 上的访问和发帖频率下降。

Think of Snapchat’s struggles to differentiate between its utility— as a way to communicate among friends—and its entertainment function as a place famous people broadcast content to their fans.  

想一想 Snapchat 很难区分其实用性（作为朋友之间交流的方式）和娱乐功能（作为名人向粉丝广播内容的地方）。  

In a controversial redesign, Snapchat cleaved the broadcast content from influencers into the righthand Discover tab, leaving your conversations with friends in the left Chat pane.  

在一次有争议的重新设计中，Snapchat 将影响者的广播内容分割到右侧的“发现”选项卡中，而将您与朋友的对话留在左侧的“聊天”窗格中。  

Look, the redesign seemed to say, Kylie Jenner is not your friend.  

看，重新设计似乎在说，凯莉·詹纳不是你的朋友。

TikTok doesn’t bump into the negative network effects of using a social graph at scale because it doesn't really have one.  

TikTok 不会遇到大规模使用社交图谱带来的负面网络效应，因为它实际上并没有社交图谱。  

It is more of a pure interest graph, one derived from its short video content, and the beauty is its algorithm is so efficient that its interest graph can be assembled without imposing much of a burden on the user at all.  

它更像是一种纯粹的兴趣图谱，源于其短视频内容，其美妙之处在于其算法非常高效，以至于可以在不给用户带来太多负担的情况下组装兴趣图谱。

It is passive personalization, learning through consumption. Because the videos are so short, the volume of training data a user provides per unit of time is high.

  

这是被动的个性化，通过消费来学习。由于视频很短，用户每单位时间提供的训练数据量很大。  

Because the videos are entertaining, this training process feels effortless, even enjoyable, for the user.  

由于视频很有趣，因此用户会感觉这个培训过程毫不费力，甚至很有趣。

I like to say that “**when you gaze into TikTok, TikTok gazes into you**.” Think of all the countless hours product managers, designers and engineers have dedicated to growth-hacking social onboarding—goading people into adding friends and following people, urging them to grant access to their phone contact lists—all in an attempt to carry them past the dead zone to the minimum viable graph size necessary to provide them with a healthy, robust feed.  

我喜欢说“当你凝视 TikTok 时，TikTok 也在凝视你。”想想产品经理、设计师和工程师花费了无数的时间致力于增长黑客社交引导——刺激人们添加朋友和关注人们，敦促他们授予对手机联系人列表的访问权限——所有这些都是为了让他们超越死区到为它们提供健康、稳健的饲料所需的最小可行图形大小。  

(sidenote: Every social product manager has heard the story of Facebook and Twitter’s keystone metrics for minimum viable friend or follow graph size countless times.) Think of how many damn interest bubble UI’s you’ve had to sit through before you could start using some new social product: what subjects interest you?  

（旁注：每个社交产品经理都无数次听说过 Facebook 和 Twitter 的最小可行朋友或关注图表大小的关键指标的故事。）想想在你开始使用一些该死的兴趣泡沫 UI 之前，你必须经历多少个该死的兴趣泡沫 UI。新社交产品：您对哪些科目感兴趣？  

who are your favorite musicians?  

你最喜欢的音乐家是谁？  

what types of movies do you enjoy?  

你喜欢什么类型的电影？The last time I tried to use Twitter’s new user onboarding flow, it recommended I follow, among other accounts, that of Donald Trump.  

上次我尝试使用 Twitter 的新用户引导流程时，它建议我关注唐纳德·特朗普的账户等。  

There are countless ways they could onboard people more efficiently to provide them with a great experience immediately, but that is not one of them.  

他们可以通过无数种方式更有效地帮助人们立即为他们提供良好的体验，但这不是其中之一。

TikTok came along and bypassed all of that.  

TikTok 的出现绕过了这一切。  

In a two-sided entertainment marketplace, they provide creators on one side with unmatched video creation tools coupled with potential super-scaled distribution, and viewers on the other side with an endless stream of entertainment that gets more personalized with time.  

在双边娱乐市场中，它们为一侧的创作者提供无与伦比的视频创作工具以及潜在的超大规模发行，为另一侧的观众提供源源不断的娱乐，并且随着时间的推移变得更加个性化。  

In doing so, TikTok, with a product team and infrastructure mostly located in China, came out of left field and became a player in the attention marketplace on the same playing fields around the world as giants like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Netflix.  

通过这样做，产品团队和基础设施主要位于中国的 TikTok 脱颖而出，成为与 Facebook、Instagram、Snapchat、YouTube 等巨头在全球同一竞争环境中关注度市场的参与者。 Netflix。  

Not quite a Cinderella story...maybe a Mulan story?  

不完全是灰姑娘的故事……也许是花木兰的故事？

TikTok didn't just break out in America.  

TikTok 不仅仅在美国爆发。  

It became unbelievably popular in India and in the Middle East, more countries whose cultures and language were foreign to the Chinese Bytedance product teams. Imagine an algorithm so clever it enables its builders to treat another market and culture as a complete black box.  

它在印度和中东以及其他文化和语言对中国字节跳动产品团队来说是陌生的国家变得令人难以置信地受欢迎。想象一下一种如此聪明的算法，它使其构建者能够将另一个市场和文化视为一个完整的黑匣子。  

What do people in that country like? No, even better, what does each individual person in each of those foreign countries like? You don't have to figure it out.  

那个国家的人喜欢什么？不，更好的是，每个国家的每个人都喜欢什么？你不必弄清楚。  

The algorithm will handle that. The algorithm knows.  

算法会处理这个问题。算法知道。

I don’t think the Chinese product teams I’ve met in recent years in China are much further ahead than the ones I met in 2011 when it comes to understanding foreign cultures like America.  

我不认为我近年来在中国遇到的中国产品团队在理解美国等外国文化方面比我在 2011 年遇到的团队领先很多。  

But what the Bytedance algorithm did was it abstracted that problem away.  

但字节跳动算法所做的是将这个问题抽象出来。One of the concerns about CCP ties with Bytedance is that they might use it as a propaganda tool against the U.S. I tend to think that problem is overrated because my sense is that many in China still don't understand the nuances of American culture, just as America doesn't understand theirs (though I speak Mandarin, some of the memes on Douyin fly way over my head).  

对中共与字节跳动关系的担忧之一是他们可能会将其用作针对美国的宣传工具。我倾向于认为这个问题被高估了，因为我的感觉是许多中国人仍然不了解美国文化的细微差别，只是因为美国听不懂他们的（虽然我会说普通话，但抖音上的一些表情包却让我无法理解）。  

However, perhaps an algorithm that abstracts culture into a series of stimuli responses makes it more dangerous?  

然而，也许将文化抽象为一系列刺激反应的算法会使其更加危险？

Now imagine that level of hyper efficient interest matching applied to other opportunities and markets. Personalized TV of the future? Check. Education?  

现在想象一下，超高效的利益匹配水平应用于其他机会和市场。未来的个性化电视？查看。教育？  

I already find a lot of education videos in my TikTok feed, on everything from cooking to magic to iPhone hacks.  

我已经在我的 TikTok feed 中找到了很多教育视频，内容涵盖从烹饪到魔术再到 iPhone 破解等各种内容。  

Scale that up and Alex and Louis might finally realize their dream of a short video education app that they set out to build before Musical.ly.  

如果扩大规模，亚历克斯和路易斯可能最终会实现他们在 Musical.ly 之前就开始构建的短视频教育应用程序的梦想。

Shopping? A slam dunk, Douyin and Toutiao already enable a ton of commerce in China. Job marketplace? A bit of a stretch, but not impossible.  

购物？抖音和今日头条已经在中国实现了大量的商业活动。就业市场？有点牵强，但并非不可能。  

If Microsoft buys TikTok, I’d certainly give the TikTok team a crack at improving my LinkedIn feed, which, to be clear, is horrifying.  

如果微软收购 TikTok，我肯定会让 TikTok 团队尝试改进我的 LinkedIn feed，坦白说，这很可怕。  

What about personalized reading, from books to newsletters to blogs? Music? Podcasts? Yes, yes, yes please. Dating?  

从书籍到时事通讯再到博客的个性化阅读怎么样？音乐？播客？是的，是的，是的，请。约会？  

The world could absolutely use an alternative to the high GINI co-efficient, high inequality dating marketplace that is Tinder.  

世界绝对可以使用 Tinder 来替代高基尼系数、高不平等的约会市场。

Douyin already visualizes much of this future for us with its much broader diversity of videos and revenue models.  

抖音凭借其更广泛的视频和收入模式，已经为我们预见了这一未来。  

In China, video e-commerce is light years ahead of where it is in the U.S. (for a variety of reasons, but none that aren’t surmountable; a topic, again, for another piece).  

在中国，视频电子商务比美国领先数光年（原因有很多，但没有一个是不可克服的；这又是另一篇文章的主题）。  

Whereas TikTok can still feel, to me, like a pure entertainment time-killer, Douyin, which I track on a separate phone I keep just to run Chinese apps for research purposes, feels like much more than that.  

对我来说，TikTok 仍然感觉像是一个纯粹的娱乐时间杀手，但我在另一部手机上追踪抖音，只是为了运行中国应用程序进行研究，但感觉却远不止于此。  

It feels like a realization of short video as a broad use case platform.  

感觉就像短视频作为一个广泛的用例平台的实现。

There’s a reason that many people in the U.S. today describe social media as work. And why many, like me, have come to find TikTok a much more fun app to spend time in.  

如今，许多美国人将社交媒体描述为工作是有原因的。这也是为什么像我一样的许多人发现 TikTok 是一个更有趣的应用程序，可以消磨时间。  

Apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built on social graphs, and as such, they amplify the scale, ubiquity, and reach of our performative social burden.  

Facebook、Instagram 和 Twitter 等应用程序是建立在社交图谱之上的，因此，它们放大了我们表演性社会负担的规模、普遍性和影响范围。  

They struggle to separate their social functions from their entertainment and utility functions, injecting an aspect of social artifice where it never used to exist.  

他们努力将社交功能与娱乐和实用功能分开，注入了以前从未存在过的社交技巧。

Facebook has struggled with its transition to utility, which would’ve offered it a path towards becoming more of a societal operating system the way WeChat is in China.  

Facebook 一直在努力向实用程序转型，而这本可以为它提供一条成为社交操作系统的道路，就像中国的微信一样。  

To be fair, the competition for many of those functions is much stiffer in the U.S. In payments, for example, Facebook must compete with credit cards, which work fine and which most people default to in the U.S., whereas in China AliPay and WeChat Pay were competing with a cash-dominant culture.  

公平地说，这些功能中的许多功能在美国的竞争要激烈得多。例如，在支付方面，Facebook 必须与信用卡竞争，信用卡在美国运行良好，大多数人都默认使用信用卡，而在中国，支付宝和微信支付正在与现金主导的文化竞争。  

Still, in the U.S., Facebook has yet to make any real inroads in significant utility use cases like commerce.  

尽管如此，在美国，Facebook 尚未在商业等重要实用用例方面取得任何真正的进展。I speak so often about how much video as a medium is underrated by tech elites.  

我经常谈到视频作为一种媒体在多大程度上被科技精英低估了。  

In an alternate history of Facebook, they would've made a harder shift to becoming a video-only app, moving up the ladder from text to photos to videos, and maybe they would've become TikTok before TikTok.  

在 Facebook 的另一条历史中，他们可能会做出更艰难的转变，成为一款纯视频应用程序，从文本到照片再到视频，也许他们会在 TikTok 之前成为 TikTok。  

If they had, I think their time spent figures would be even higher today.  

如果他们这样做了，我认为他们今天花费的时间会更高。  

For as quickly as Facebook moved to disrupt itself in the past, there's a limit to how far they're willing to go.  

尽管 Facebook 过去曾以极快的速度进行自我颠覆，但他们愿意走多远却是有限的。  

I plan to compare the Chinese and U.S. tech ecosystems in a future post, and one of the broadest and most important takeaways is that China leapfrogged the U.S. in the shift to video, among many other things.  

我计划在未来的文章中比较中国和美国的科技生态系统，最广泛和最重要的结论之一是，中国在向视频的转变等方面超越了美国。  

This doesn't mean the U.S. won't then leapfrog China the next time around, but for now, the U.S. is the trailing frog in several categories.  

这并不意味着美国下次不会超越中国，但就目前而言，美国在几个方面都落后于青蛙。

Instagram is some strange hybrid mix of social and interest graph, and now it’s also a jumble of formats, with a Stories feed relegated to a top bar in the app while the more stagnant and less active original feed continues to run vertically as the default.  

Instagram 是社交和兴趣图的奇怪混合体，现在它也是一种混乱的格式，故事提要被降级到应用程序的顶部栏，而更停滞和不太活跃的原始提要继续默认垂直运行。  

Messaging is pushed to a separate pane and also served by a separate app.  

消息传递被推送到单独的窗格，并由单独的应用程序提供服务。  

Longer form videos bounce you to Instagram TV, which is just an app for videos that exceed some time limit, I guess? And soon, perhaps commerce will be jammed in somehow?  

较长的视频会让你跳到 Instagram TV，我猜这只是一个针对超过时间限制的视频的应用程序？很快，也许商业会以某种方式陷入困境？  

Meanwhile, they have a Discover tab, or whatever it is called, which seems like it could be the default tab if they wanted to take a more interest-based approach like TikTok.  

与此同时，他们有一个“发现”选项卡，或者不管它叫什么名字，如果他们想采取像 TikTok 这样更加基于兴趣的方法，这似乎可能是默认选项卡。  

But they seem to have punted on making any hard decisions for so long now that the app is just a Frankenstein of feeds and formats and functions spread across a somewhat confused constellation of apps.  

但他们似乎长期以来一直在做出任何艰难的决定，以至于该应用程序只是一个由提要、格式和功能组成的弗兰肯斯坦，分布在一些有些混乱的应用程序群中。

Twitter has never seemed to know what it is. Ask ten different Twitter employees, you’ll hear ten different answers.  

Twitter 似乎从来不知道它是什么。询问十位不同的 Twitter 员工，你会听到十种不同的答案。  

Perhaps that’s why the dominant product philosophy of the company seems to be a sort of constant paralysis broken up by the occasional crisis mitigation.  

也许这就是为什么该公司的主导产品理念似乎是一种持续的瘫痪，但偶尔会缓解危机。  

One reason I’ve long wished Twitter had just become a open protocol and let the developer community go to town is that Twitter moves. At. A. Snail's. Pace.  

我一直希望 Twitter 成为一个开放协议并让开发者社区参与其中的一个原因是 Twitter 会移动。在。 A. 蜗牛的。步伐。

The shame of it is that Twitter had a head start on an interest graph, largely through the work of its users, who gave signal on what they cared about through the graphs they assembled.  

遗憾的是，Twitter 在兴趣图谱方面占据了领先地位，这主要是通过其用户的工作，他们通过收集的图谱表达了他们关心的内容。  

That could have been a foundation to all sorts of new markets for them.  

这可能成为他们开拓各种新市场的基础。  

They could’ve even been an interest-based social network, but instead users have mostly extracted that value themselves by pinging each other through the woefully neglected DM product.  

它们甚至可能是一个基于兴趣的社交网络，但相反，用户大多通过通过被严重忽视的 DM 产品互相 ping 来自己提取该价值。Of course, Twitter also once purchased Vine and then let it wither on the, uh vine.  

当然，Twitter也曾经收购过Vine，然后让它在呃藤上枯萎。  

Of all the tech companies that could purchase TikTok, maybe Twitter is the one that least deserves it.  

在所有可以收购 TikTok 的科技公司中，Twitter 或许是最不值得收购的一家。  

At a minimum, they should be required to submit a book report showing they understand what it is they're buying.  

至少，应该要求他们提交一份读书报告，表明他们了解自己购买的是什么。

A few other tech companies are worth mentioning here. YouTube is a massive video network, but honestly they may have shipped even less than Twitter over the years.  

这里值得一提的是其他一些科技公司。 YouTube 是一个庞大的视频网络，但老实说，多年来他们的出货量甚至可能比 Twitter 还要少。  

That they don’t have any video creation tools of note (do they have any?!) and allowed TikTok to come in and steal the short video space is both shocking and not.  

他们没有任何值得注意的视频创作工具（他们有吗？！）并允许 TikTok 进来并抢占短视频空间，这既令人震惊又不令人震惊。

Amazon launched a short video commerce app some time ago. It came and went so quickly I didn’t even have time to try it.  

亚马逊前段时间推出了一款短视频商务应用。它来得快去得也快，我什至没有时间去尝试。  

Though Amazon is good at many things, they just don’t have the DNA to build something like TikTok.  

尽管亚马逊擅长很多事情，但他们只是不具备打造 TikTok 这样的产品的基因。  

That they have failed to realize the short video commerce vision that China led the way on is a shocking miss on their part.  

他们未能实现中国引领的短视频商业愿景，这对他们来说是一个令人震惊的失误。

Apple owns the actual camera that so many of these videos are shot on, but they've never understood social.  

苹果拥有拍摄许多视频的实际相机，但他们从来不了解社交。iMessages could be a social networking colossus if Apple had the social DNA, but every day other messaging apps pull further away in functionality and design.  

如果苹果拥有社交 DNA，iMessages 可能会成为社交网络巨头，但其他消息应用程序每天都在功能和设计上落后。  

But I guess they're finally adding threading in iMessages with the next iOS release? Haha.  

但我猜他们最终会在下一个 iOS 版本中在 iMessages 中添加线程？哈哈。 At least they'll continue to improve the camera hardware with every successive iPhone release.  

至少他们会在每一款 iPhone 的后续发布中继续改进相机硬件。

None of this is to say TikTok is anywhere near the market value of any of these aforementioned American tech giants.  

这并不是说 TikTok 的市值接近上述任何一家美国科技巨头的市值。  

If you still think of it as a novelty meme short video app, you're not far from the truth.  

如果您仍然认为它是一款新奇的模因短视频应用程序，那么您离事实并不遥远。Are there flaws with TikTok? Of course. It’s far from perfect. The algorithm can be too clingy.  

TikTok有缺陷吗？当然。它远非完美。该算法可能太粘人了。  

Sometimes I like one video from some meme and the next day TikTok serves me too many follow-up videos from the same meme.  

有时我喜欢某个模因中的一个视频，第二天 TikTok 就会为我提供太多来自同一模因的后续视频。  

But the great thing about a hyper-responsive algorithm is that you can tune it quickly, almost like priming GPT-3 to get the results you want.  

但超响应算法的优点在于您可以快速调整它，就像启动 GPT-3 以获得您想要的结果一样。  

Often all it takes to inject some new subculture into your TikTok feed is to find some video from it (you can easily find them on YouTube or via friends whose feeds are different from your own) and like it.  

通常，要在你的 TikTok 动态中注入一些新的亚文化，只需从中找到一些视频（你可以轻松地在 YouTube 上或通过与你的动态不同的朋友找到它们）并喜欢它。  

Another problem for TikTok is that a lot of other use cases are being jammed into what was designed to be a portrait mode lip synch video app.  

TikTok 的另一个问题是，许多其他用例都被塞进了一个设计为肖像模式口型同步视频应用程序中。  

Vertical video is good for the human figure, for dance and makeup videos, but not ideal for other types of communication and storytelling (I still hate when basketball and football highlight clips can’t show more of the horizontal playing field, and that goes for both IG and TikTok; in many highlights of Steph Curry hitting a long 3 you can’t see him, or the basket, only one of the two, lol).  

垂直视频对于人物、舞蹈和化妆视频有好处，但对于其他类型的交流和讲故事来说并不理想（我仍然讨厌篮球和足球精彩片段无法展示更多的水平比赛场地，这适用于IG 和 TikTok；在斯蒂芬·库里投出长距离三分球的许多精彩片段中，你看不到他，也看不到篮筐，只有两者之一，哈哈）。 Stepping up a level, the list of opportunities Bytedance and TikTok have yet to capitalize on in the U.S. is long, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they miss many of them even if they stave off a ban from the U.S. government.  

更进一步来说，字节跳动和 TikTok 在美国尚未利用的机会清单很长，即使他们避开了美国政府的禁令，如果他们错过其中许多机会，我也不会感到惊讶。  

Much of it would require new form factors, and it’s unclear how strong the TikTok product team would be, especially if divested out of Bytedance.  

其中大部分需要新的形式因素，目前还不清楚 TikTok 产品团队的实力如何，尤其是如果从字节跳动剥离的话。  

Under Microsoft, a company with a fairly shaky history in the consumer market, it's unclear that their full potential would be realized.  

在微软这个消费市场历史相当不稳定的公司的领导下，目前尚不清楚他们是否能充分发挥潜力。

Still, none of that product work is rocket science. Much of it seems clear in my head.  

尽管如此，这些产品工作都不是火箭科学。我的脑海中似乎很清楚其中的大部分内容。  

More importantly, TikTok, if armed with the Bytedance algorithm as part of a divestment, has a generalized interest-matching algorithm that can allow it to tackle U.S. tech giants not head on but from an oblique angle.  

更重要的是，如果TikTok作为撤资的一部分配备了字节跳动的算法，那么它就拥有了一种通用的利益匹配算法，可以让它不是正面而是从斜角来对付美国科技巨头。  

To see it as merely a novelty meme video app for kids is to miss what its much greater disruptive potential. That an app launched out of China could come to the U.S. and sprint into cultural relevance in this attention marketplace should be a wake-up call to complacent U.S. tech companies.  

如果仅仅将其视为一款新奇的儿童模因视频应用程序，就会忽视它更大的颠覆性潜力。一款从中国推出的应用程序可能会登陆美国，并在这个注意力市场中冲刺到文化相关性，这应该给自满的美国科技公司敲响警钟。  

Given how many of those companies rely on intuiting user interests to sell them things or to show them ads, a company like TikTok which found a shortcut to assembling such an interest graph should raise all sorts of alarm bells.  

考虑到其中有多少公司依靠直觉的用户兴趣来向他们出售商品或向他们展示广告，像 TikTok 这样的公司找到了组装此类兴趣图的捷径，应该敲响各种警钟。

It surprises me that more U.S. tech companies aren’t taking a harder run at trying to acquire TikTok if the rumored CFIUS hammer stops short of an outright ban.  

令我惊讶的是，如果传闻中的 CFIUS 锤子没有彻底禁止，更多的美国科技公司并没有采取更严厉的措施试图收购 TikTok。  

I can’t think of any of them that shouldn’t be bidding for what is a once-in-a-generation forced fire sale asset. I’ve seen prices like $30B tossed around online.  

我想不出他们中的任何一个人不应该竞购这个千载难逢的强制甩卖资产。我在网上看到过类似 $30B 的价格。  

If that’s true, it’s an absolute bargain. I’d easily pay twice that without a second thought.  

如果这是真的，这绝对是一笔划算的交易。我会毫不犹豫地支付两倍的费用。

I could cycle through my long list of nits, but ultimately they are all easily solvable with the right product vision and execution.  

我可以循环浏览一长串的问题，但最终，通过正确的产品愿景和执行，它们都可以轻松解决。  

TikTok has figured out the hardest piece, the algorithm.  

TikTok 已经找到了最难的部分，即算法。  

With it, a massive team made up mostly by people who’ve never left China, and many who never will, grabbed massive marketshare in cultures and markets they’d never experienced firsthand.  

凭借它，一支主要由从未离开过中国的人以及许多永远不会离开中国的人组成的庞大团队，在他们从未亲身经历过的文化和市场中占据了巨大的市场份额。  

To a cultural determinist like myself, that feels like black magic.  

对于像我这样的文化决定论者来说，这感觉就像黑魔法。

On that same trip to China in 2018 when I visited Bytedance, an ex-colleague of mine from Hulu organized a visit for me to [Newsdog](https://www.newsdogapp.com/en/). It was a news app for the Indian market built by a startup headquartered in Beijing.  

2018 年，在我访问字节跳动的同一次中国之行中，我在 Hulu 的一位前同事组织了我对 Newsdog 的访问。这是一款针对印度市场的新闻应用程序，由一家总部位于北京的初创公司开发。  

As I exited the elevator into their lobby, I was greeted by a giant mural of Jeff Bezos’ famous saying “It’s Always Day One” on the opposite wall.  

当我走出电梯进入他们的大厅时，对面的墙上有一幅巨大的壁画，上面写着杰夫·贝佐斯的名言“永远是第一天”。

A friend of a friend was the CEO there, and he sat me down in a conference room to walk me through their app.  

朋友的朋友是那里的首席执行官，他让我坐在会议室里，引导我使用他们的应用程序。  

They had raised $50M from Tencent just a few months earlier that year, and they were the number one news app in India at the time.  

那年早些时候，他们从腾讯筹集了 5000 万美元，是当时印度排名第一的新闻应用。

He opened the app on his phone and handed it to me.  

他打开手机上的应用程序并将其递给我。  

Similar to Toutiao in China, there were different topic areas in a scrollbar across the top, with a vertical feed of stories beneath each.  

与中国的今日头条类似，顶部的滚动条中有不同的主题区域，每个主题下方都有垂直的故事推送。  

All of these were stories selected algorithmically, as is the style of Toutiao and so many apps in China.  

所有这些都是通过算法选择的故事，就像今日头条和中国许多应用程序的风格一样。

I looked through the stories, all in Hindi (and yes, one feed that contained the thirst trap photos of attractive Indian girls in rather suggestive outfits standing under things like waterfalls; some parts of culture are universal).  

我浏览了这些故事，全都是印地语的（是的，其中一个提要包含了迷人的印度女孩的渴陷阱照片，这些女孩穿着相当具有暗示性的服装站在瀑布等东西下；文化的某些部分是普遍的）。  

Then I looked up from the app and through the glass walls of the conference room at an office filled with about 40 Chinese engineers, mostly male, tapping away on their computers.  

然后我从应用程序中抬起头，透过会议室的玻璃墙，办公室里挤满了大约 40 名中国工程师，其中大多数是男性，正在敲击电脑。  

Then I looked back down at page after page of Hindi stories in the app.  

然后我回头查看应用程序中一页又一页的印地语故事。

“Wait,” I asked. “Do you have people in this office or at the company who know how to read Hindi?”  

“等等，”我问道。 “这个办公室或公司里有人知道如何阅读印地语吗？”

He looked at me with a smile.  

他微笑着看着我。

“No,” he said. “None of us can read any of it.”  

“不，”他说。 “我们没有人能读懂其中的任何内容。”

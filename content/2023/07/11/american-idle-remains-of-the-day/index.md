I promised one final piece on TikTok, focused primarily on the network effects of creativity. And this is that, in part.  

我承诺写一篇关于 TikTok 的最后一篇文章，主要关注创造力的网络效应。这就是部分原因。  

But it discusses a bunch of other topics, some only tangentially related to TikTok.  

但它讨论了许多其他主题，其中一些仅与 TikTok 无关。

All the points I wanted to cover seem hyperlinked in a sprawling loose tangle. This could easily have been several standalone posts. I've been stuck on how to structure it.  

我想要涵盖的所有要点似乎都在杂乱无章的松散混乱中相互链接。这很可能是几个独立的帖子。我一直纠结于如何构建它。

Some people find my posts too long. I’m sympathetic to the modern plague of shortened attention spans, but I also don’t want lazy readers.  

有些人觉得我的帖子太长了。我对注意力持续时间缩短的现代瘟疫表示同情，但我也不想要懒惰的读者。  

At the same time, this piece felt like it was missing a through line that would help pull a reader through.  

与此同时，这篇文章感觉缺少一条有助于读者理解的主线。

And then I had a minor epiphany, or perhaps it was a moment of delusion.  

然后我有了一个小小的顿悟，或者也许是一个错觉的时刻。  

Either way, it provided an organizing conceit: I decided to write this piece in the style of the TikTok FYP feed.  

不管怎样，它提供了一个组织性的想法：我决定以 TikTok FYP feed 的风格来写这篇文章。  

That is, a series of short bits, laid out vertically in a long scrolling feed.  

也就是说，一系列短位在长滚动提要中垂直排列。

This piece is long, but if you get bored in any one section, you can just scroll on the next one; they're separated by horizontal rules for easy visual scanning.  

这篇文章很长，但是如果你对任何一节感到无聊，你可以滚动到下一节；它们由水平线分隔，以便于视觉扫描。  

You can also read them out of order. There are lots of cross-references, though, so if you skip some of the segments, others may not make complete sense.  

您也可以不按顺序阅读它们。不过，有很多交叉引用，因此如果您跳过某些部分，其他部分可能不会完全有意义。  

However, it’s ultimately not a big deal.  

然而，这最终没什么大不了的。

If I had more time, I might have built this essay as a series of full-screen cards that you could swipe from one to the next. Or perhaps tap from one to the next, like [Robin Sloan’s tap essay](https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/) (I wish there a way to export this piece into a form like that, if someone built that already let me know).  

如果我有更多时间，我可能会将这篇文章构建为一系列全屏卡片，您可以从一张卡片滑动到下一张卡片。或者也许从一个点击到下一个，就像 Robin Sloan 的 Tap essay（我希望有一种方法可以将这篇文章导出到类似的形式，如果有人已经构建了它，已经让我知道了）。  

And if I were even more ambitious, I would've used some Anki-like spaced repetition algorithm to randomize the order in which the following text chunks are presented to you, shuffling it each time a reader jumped in.  

如果我更加雄心勃勃，我会使用一些类似 Anki 的间隔重复算法来随机化以下文本块呈现给您的顺序，并在每次读者跳入时对其进行打乱。The most meta way for me to ship this essay would have been as a series of TikTok videos. It would have been the Snowfall of TikTok essays.  

对我来说，发表这篇文章的最元方式是作为一系列 TikTok 视频。这将是 TikTok 文章的降雪。  

That would have also taken a year of my life (which, being locked inside because of a pandemic might be the time to attempt something like that?). Also, I am camera shy.  

这也需要我生命中的一年（因为大流行而被锁在里面可能是尝试类似事情的时候了？）。另外，我很害羞。

But as it is, this is what you get.  

但事实上，这就是你得到的。

By network effects of creativity, I mean that every additional user on TikTok makes every other user more creative.  

我所说的创造力的网络效应是指 TikTok 上每增加一个用户都会让其他用户变得更有创造力。

This exists in a weak form on every social network and on the internet at large.  

这在每个社交网络和整个互联网上都以弱形式存在。  

The connected age means we are exposed to so much from so many more people than at any point in human history. That can't help but compound creativity.  

互联时代意味着我们接触到的人比人类历史上任何时候都多。这无助于增强创造力。

Various memes and trends pass around on networks like Instagram and Twitter.  

各种表情包和趋势在 Instagram 和 Twitter 等网络上传播。  

But there, you still have to create your own version of a meme from scratch, even if, on Twitter, it's as simple as copying and pasting.  

但在那里，你仍然必须从头开始创建自己的模因版本，即使在 Twitter 上，它就像复制和粘贴一样简单。

But TikTok has a strong form of this type of network effect. They explicitly lower the barrier to the literal remixing of everyone else's content.  

但 TikTok 具有很强的这种网络效应。他们明确地降低了对其他人的内容进行字面混音的障碍。  

In their app, they have a wealth of features that make it dead simple to grab any element from another TikTok and incorporate it into a new TikTok.  

在他们的应用程序中，他们拥有丰富的功能，可以非常简单地从另一个 TikTok 中获取任何元素并将其合并到新的 TikTok 中。

The barrier to entry in editing video is really high as anyone who has used a non-linear editor like Premiere or compositing software like After Effects can attest.  

任何使用过 Premiere 等非线性编辑器或 After Effects 等合成软件的人都可以证明，编辑视频的门槛确实很高。  

TikTok abstracted a lot of formerly complex video editing processes into effects and filters that even an amateur can use.  

TikTok 将许多以前复杂的视频编辑过程抽象为即使是业余爱好者也可以使用的效果和滤镜。

Instagram launched one-click photo filters (after Hipstamatic, of course, though Hipstamatic lacked the feed which is like the spine of modern social apps), and later Instagram added additional features for editing Stories, and even some separate apps like Boomerang that were later re-incorporated back into Instagram as features.  

Instagram 推出了一键照片滤镜（当然是在 Hipstamatic 之后，尽管 Hipstamatic 缺乏像现代社交应用程序的支柱一样的提要），后来 Instagram 添加了编辑故事的附加功能，甚至后来出现了一些单独的应用程序，例如 Boomerang作为功能重新纳入 Instagram。

Snapchat has a gazillion video filters, too, though many are what I think of as simple facial cosmetic FX.  

Snapchat 也有无数的视频滤镜，尽管其中很多都是我认为简单的面部美容效果。

YouTube has launched almost no creator tools of note ever. WTF.  

YouTube 几乎从未推出过值得注意的创作者工具。 WTF。

TikTok launches seemingly a new video effect or filter every week.  

TikTok 似乎每周都会推出新的视频效果或滤镜。  

I regularly log in and see creators using some filter I've never heard of, and some of them are just flat out bonkers.  

我经常登录并看到创作者使用一些我从未听说过的过滤器，其中一些简直就是疯狂的。  

What creators can accomplish with some of these filters I can't even fathom how I'd replicate in something like the Adobe Creative Suite.  

创作者可以使用其中一些滤镜来完成什么，我什至无法想象如何在 Adobe Creative Suite 等工具中进行复制。

Kili So Silly (@kili.so.silly) has created a short video on TikTok with music original sound. | #stitch with @xxelacxx #TimeWarpScan #fyp #foryou  

Kili So Silly (@kili.so.silly) 在 TikTok 上制作了一段带有音乐原声的短视频。 | #stitch 与 @xxelacxx #TimeWarpScan #fyp #foryou

JeremyLynch (@jeremylynch) has created a short video on TikTok with music Despicable Me (From "Despicable Me").  

JeremyLynch (@jeremylynch) 在 TikTok 上制作了一段音乐短视频《卑鄙的我》（来自《卑鄙的我》）。  

| This freaks me out watching it back 😅 #timewarp #timewarpchallenge  

|这让我看着它感到害怕😅#timewarp #timewarpchallenge

TikTok’s Warp Scan filter is a bizarre concept for a filter in and of itself, but the myriad of ways TikTok users put it to use just shows what happens when you throw random tools to the masses and allow for emergent creativity.  

TikTok 的 Warp Scan 过滤器对于过滤器本身来说是一个奇怪的概念，但 TikTok 用户使用它的无数方式恰恰表明了当你向大众扔随机工具并允许涌现的创造力时会发生什么。  

It only takes a handful of innovators to unleash a meme tsunami.  

只需要少数创新者就能引发模因海啸。

A longstanding economics debate is why we haven't seen the effects of the internet in our productivity figures. I won't rehash every side of every argument there.  

一个长期存在的经济学争论是为什么我们没有在我们的生产力数据中看到互联网的影响。我不会重复讨论每个争论的各个方面。

But I know this: to take someone else's video and insert a reaction video of my own playing alongside it on the same screen is not easy in a traditional NLE.  

但我知道这一点：在传统的非线性编辑中，拍摄别人的视频并插入我自己在同一屏幕上播放的反应视频并不容易。  

I'm not saying it's the moon landing, but it's not trivial.  

我并不是说这是登月，但这并不是小事。

On TikTok, you can just press the Duet button and start talking into your phone, and soon you have a side-by-side of the original video and your reaction video (you can choose from any number of their preset layouts for reactions).  

在 TikTok 上，您只需按 Duet 按钮并开始对手机说话，很快您就会看到并排的原始视频和您的反应视频（您可以从任意数量的预设反应布局中进行选择）。  

That's an explicit productivity boost; I can measure it in time saved for the same output.  

这明显提高了生产力；我可以测量相同输出所节省的时间。

You won't see that show up in GDP per capita figures, but it's real.  

你不会在人均国内生产总值数据中看到这一点，但它是真实的。

Remember 2 Girls, 1 Cup? If you've seen it, how could you not?  

还记得2个女孩1个杯子吗？如果你见过，怎么能不见过呢？

What interested me was less the video, which just horrified me, but the reaction videos of people watching it.  

让我感兴趣的不是那个让我震惊的视频，而是人们观看视频时的反应视频。  

Because 2 Girls, 1 Cup was a short video, I think it was a minute or two long, you could simply watch the face of someone watching the video and sync every reaction to every horrific beat of the video now forever haunting your memory, even though the original video wasn't visible on screen.  

因为 2 Girls, 1 Cup 是一个短视频，我认为它只有一两分钟长，你可以简单地看着观看视频的人的脸，并将每个反应同步到视频中的每个可怕的节拍，现在永远萦绕在你的记忆中，甚至尽管原始视频在屏幕上不可见。  

The fun of the 2 Girls 1 Cup reaction video, but reaction videos in general, is that shared context.  

2 Girls 1 Cup 反应视频的乐趣，但总的来说，反应视频的乐趣在于共享背景。

Until TikTok came along, there wasn't an easy way to do reaction videos to other videos and have them make sense unless the original video had so much distribution that it was common knowledge.  

在 TikTok 出现之前，没有一种简单的方法可以对其他视频制作反应视频并使它们有意义，除非原始视频的传播量如此之大以至于成为常识。  

Or you could put the reaction video alongside or on top of or beneath the original video, but that required skill in using a non-linear video editor to lay those out and synchronize their timelines.  

或者，您可以将反应视频放在原始视频的旁边、上方或下方，但这需要使用非线性视频编辑器来布置这些视频并同步其时间线的技能。

With TikTok's Duet feature, you can instantly record a side-by-side reaction video to anyone else's video. Duet is the quote tweet of TikTok.  

借助 TikTok 的 Duet 功能，您可以立即录制与其他人的视频并排反应的视频。 Duet 是 TikTok 的引述推文。  

Or you don't have to do a reaction video at all. The Duet feature is designed simply to allow you to record a video that will play back alongside another video.  

或者你根本不需要制作反应视频。 Duet 功能的设计目的只是为了让您录制一个视频并与另一个视频一起播放。  

It can be used for reaction videos, sure, but also to just provide a running commentary on other videos, and there are entire accounts built around both concepts.  

当然，它可以用于反应视频，但也可以仅提供对其他视频的持续评论，并且围绕这两个概念建立了完整的帐户。

But again, the Duet feature is built at such a low level that you can treat the feature as a primitive to replicate any number of other editing tools.  

但同样，Duet 功能是在如此低的级别上构建的，您可以将该功能视为基元来复制任意数量的其他编辑工具。

One such tool is to use the Duet feature as a dynamic matte.  

其中一种工具是将 Duet 功能用作动态遮罩。  

Since you know where your video will be placed in relation to the original poster's video, you can build a video mosaic.  

由于您知道您的视频将放置在与原始海报视频相关的位置，因此您可以构建视频马赛克。

Another is to use the Duet feature to, well, [literally record duets](https://www.tiktok.com/@wrennx/video/6924520976143224070?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowicGvz%2BCXWL6%2B8oN%2Fwk4BmE6oN%2F5PumN3Yjow2aJoUya7jfG3T%2FqGqnRlBAOPtxi%2FGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAv_lhSr_xpspaqiJGkFrinHgFFpeA9mcZCj9YxKdiubCvPte83sbtsR1391OJcExa&share_item_id=6924520976143224070&share_link_id=A846985B-30B9-42A9-A419-018175861A1D&source=h5_m&timestamp=1613462445&tt_from=copy&u_code=d7dmbg55l5a2a8&user_id=6719194069853832198&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy).  

另一种方法是使用 Duet 功能来录制二重唱。

But if you allow Duets to stack, well, eventually, one [Wellerman](https://www.tiktok.com/@nathanevanss/video/6910995345421962498?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2F&referer_video_id=6910995345421962498) can bring the whole [chorus](https://www.tiktok.com/@sguerraandre/video/6915977751837166853?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow5BYviigViN05sKmeob3jbqID%2BCPyuOhK%2FBlRnC77QAXkDVyKghUS%2BildLI1WV2k8GgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAv_lhSr_xpspaqiJGkFrinHgFFpeA9mcZCj9YxKdiubCvPte83sbtsR1391OJcExa&share_item_id=6915977751837166853&share_link_id=C0991AF3-E164-4F89-94A4-086017E0BABB&source=h5_m&timestamp=1613462684&tt_from=copy&u_code=d7dmbg55l5a2a8&user_id=6719194069853832198&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy) to your [yard](https://www.tiktok.com/@tahnex/video/6916118495080107265?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowUgxqc6Nkvi35uHYUS9xzdvJYf8TOSpQ%2Ff2HTzAusl46SgzmNsv%2FsVO3Q83Ul96ZZGgA%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAv_lhSr_xpspaqiJGkFrinHgFFpeA9mcZCj9YxKdiubCvPte83sbtsR1391OJcExa&share_item_id=6916118495080107265&share_link_id=3DED116E-8C75-496A-9887-E4266F35A399&source=h5_m&timestamp=1613462889&tt_from=copy&u_code=d7dmbg55l5a2a8&user_id=6719194069853832198&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy).  

但如果你允许二重唱叠加，那么最终，一个 Wellerman 可以将整个合唱团带到你的院子里。

Someone truly ambitious could adjust the playback speed of various levels of Inception from the film Inception and stack them and synchronize them in TikTok using the Duet feature.  

真正有雄心的人可以调整电影《盗梦空间》中各个级别的播放速度，并使用 Duet 功能将它们堆叠并同步到 TikTok 中。  

If I had more time I'd do this myself, but the time has come for some time-rich kid out there to take this on.  

如果我有更多时间，我会自己做这件事，但现在是时候让一些有时间的孩子来承担这件事了。

Knowing that others can Duet your video means you can post any number of videos as prompts.  

知道其他人可以对您的视频进行二重唱意味着您可以根据提示发布任意数量的视频。

For example, you can read one side of the dialogue in a two-hander.  

例如，您可以用双手阅读对话的一侧。

sara (@saraecheagaray) has created a short video on TikTok with music 人生のメリーゴーランド (Jazzical Lounge ver.) \[『ハウルの動く城』より\].  

sara (@saraecheagaray) 在 TikTok 上制作了一段音乐短片《人生のメリーゴーランド (Jazzical Lounge ver.) \[『ハウルの动く城』より\]。  

| #duet with @thechrisbarnett NOW I can say my accent sucks #fyp #foryou #acting  

| #与@thechrisbarnett的二重唱现在我可以说我的口音很烂#fyp #foryou #acting

Knowing that TikTok has a Stitch feature, you can also post a question in a video and expect that some number of people will use Stitch an answer to your question and distribute that as a new video.  

知道 TikTok 具有 Stitch 功能后，您还可以在视频中发布问题，并期望一些人会使用 Stitch 来回答您的问题并将其作为新视频分发。

A popular prompt is "[Tell me you're X without telling me you're X](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tell-me-without-telling-me)" or any number of its variants like "Show me you're X without showing me you're X."  

一个流行的提示是“告诉我你是 X，而不是告诉我你是 X”或其任何变体，例如“告诉我你是 X，而不是告诉我你是 X”。

Stitch wasn't necessarily designed to be used in this way, but as a primitive it's well-suited to any number of uses, including making TikTok a sort of video Quora.  

Stitch 不一定是为了以这种方式使用而设计的，但作为一种原语，它非常适合多种用途，包括使 TikTok 成为一种视频 Quora。

Video prompts can come from not only other TikTok videos but commenters.  

视频提示不仅可以来自其他 TikTok 视频，还可以来自评论者。

Some TikTok videos are made in response to requests posted in the comments.  

一些 TikTok 视频是应评论中发布的请求而制作的。  

The comment is excerpted and published as an on screen text overlay at the beginning of the response video.  

该评论被摘录并作为屏幕上的文本叠加层发布在响应视频的开头。

This is another of the nested feedback loops within the global feedback loop that is the FYP talent show.  

这是全局反馈循环中的另一个嵌套反馈循环，即 FYP 选秀节目。  

Once one example of this went viral, then the entire community adopted this as one of the norms of the community.  

一旦这样的一个例子被病毒式传播，整个社区就会将其作为社区的规范之一。

The Daily Show with Jon Stewart was a show almost entirely built around the reaction video.  

乔恩·斯图尔特每日秀几乎完全围绕反应视频展开。  

Stewart would play some clip of a politician being a hypocrite, or some Fox News anchor spouting their usual performative indignation, and then the camera would cut back to Stewart, his face frozen in some emoji mask of shock: eyes wide, mouth agape.  

斯图尔特会播放一些政客伪君子的片段，或者福克斯新闻主播滔滔不绝地表达他们通常的愤慨，然后镜头会切回到斯图尔特，他的脸冻结在震惊的表情符号面具中：睁大眼睛，张大嘴巴。

Social networks, and entertainment networks like TikTok, have completed the work of democratizing reactions. Yes, there's no reason you need to react to everything.  

社交网络和 TikTok 等娱乐网络已经完成了民主化反应的工作。是的，您没有理由需要对所有事情做出反应。  

But it's human nature. This is the social contract of the social media era.  

但这是人性。这是社交媒体时代的社会契约。  

If you dare to shout your opinion or publish your work to the masses, the masses can choose to shout back.  

如果你敢于向群众喊出你的意见，或者发表你的作品，群众可以选择喊回。

Gossip litigates and fleshes out the boundaries of acceptable behavior within groups. Whereas gossip used to be contained, social networks now give it global distribution.  

八卦会引起争议并充实群体内可接受行为的界限。过去八卦是受到限制的，而现在社交网络让八卦传播到全球。  

This is one reason of many we've seen in-group and out-group boundaries drawn in bolder weight in this era.  

这是我们在这个时代看到群体内和群体外界限被更加粗暴划定的许多原因之一。  

For every wide-eyed look of horror by Jon Stewart, you had the furrowed brow of disbelief that is Tucker Carlson's signature look, like someone in his elevator car passed gas.  

乔恩·斯图尔特 (Jon Stewart) 的每一次睁大眼睛的惊恐表情，都会伴随着塔克·卡尔森 (Tucker Carlson) 标志性的皱眉表情，就像有人在电梯轿厢里加油一样。

Now extend that to clapbacks on the internet and you have a world in which back-channel gossip, a useful release valve and distribution channel for information about our peers, has become an open dialogue.  

现在将其扩展到互联网上的热烈讨论，你会发现，在这个世界里，秘密渠道的八卦已经成为一种公开的对话，它是有关我们同行的信息的有用的释放阀和分发渠道。  

The grapevine became the public feed, and every day, kangaroo court is in session.  

小道消息成为公众的饲料，袋鼠法庭每天都在开庭。

TikTok's Duet feature belongs in the social media hall of fame of primitives alongside features like Follow and the Like button.  

TikTok 的 Duet 功能与“关注”和“点赞”按钮等功能一起属于原始社交媒体名人堂。

What feature better epitomizes the remix, react culture of the internet? Paul Ford once wrote that "[Why Wasn't I Consulted?](https://www.ftrain.com/wwic)" is the fundamental question of the web.  

什么功能更好地体现了互联网的混音、反应文化？保罗·福特曾经写道：“为什么我没有咨询过？”是网络的基本问题。  

By then, social networks were well on their way to taking over from the web, and in the process, installing the plumbing by which the masses could finally directly opine to the masses, who could, in return, directly consult back.  

到那时，社交网络已经开始接管网络，并在此过程中安装了管道，让群众最终可以直接向群众发表意见，而群众也可以直接向群众咨询。  

The "reply guy" is the consultant class of the internet, and mansplaining is its verb.  

“回复人”是互联网的顾问阶层，mansplaining是它的动词。

Yes, there are quote tweets and replies, but the TikTok Duet is the video analog, so simple and elegant in its design that you wonder why YouTube didn't launch it ten years ago, and then you remember that YouTube hasn't launched any creator tools of note since...ever.  

是的，有引用推文和回复，但 TikTok Duet 是视频模拟，其设计如此简单和优雅，以至于你想知道为什么 YouTube 十年前没有推出它，然后你会记得 YouTube 还没有推出任何内容自...以来一直备受关注的创作者工具。

What the Duet feature does, as described by how it would be done in a traditional non-linear editing program like Adobe Premiere, is the following:  

Duet 功能的作用（如 Adobe Premiere 等传统非线性编辑程序中的操作方式所述）如下：

1.  Copies the original file  
    
    复制原始文件
2.  Inserts a new video track and a new audio track on top of the originals  
    
    在原始轨道上插入新的视频轨道和新的音频轨道
3.  Allows you to lay down a new video on those new tracks  
    
    允许您在这些新轨道上放置新视频
4.  Performs a whole series of steps to arrange the videos side-by-side on screen  
    
    执行一系列步骤以在屏幕上并排排列视频

TikTok abstracts a bunch of steps into a single function.  

TikTok 将一堆步骤抽象为一个函数。

Yes, yes, some of these features in TikTok came from Musical.ly. But that's just a meta form of the theme of this piece! TikTok sampled from Musical.ly and improved upon it.  

是的，是的，TikTok 中的一些功能来自 Musical.ly。但这只是这篇文章主题的一种元形式！ TikTok 借鉴了 Musical.ly 的经验并对其进行了改进。  

They remixed a remix app.  

他们重新混合了一个重新混合应用程序。

But also, isn't this how innovation happens? We stand on the shoulder of giants and all that? Good artists copy, great artists steal?  

但同时，创新不就是这样发生的吗？我们站在巨人的肩膀上还是什么？好的艺术家抄袭，伟大的艺术家偷窃？

TikTok enables, for video and audio, the type of combinatorial evolution that Brian Arthur describes as the underlying mechanism of the tech industry's innovation.  

TikTok 为视频和音频带来了布莱恩·阿瑟 (Brian Arthur) 所描述的科技行业创新的基本机制的组合进化类型。

How many truly original ideas are there in Silicon Valley? Very few. Most have been tried umpteenth times in the past.  

硅谷有多少真正原创的想法？很少。大多数过去已经尝试过无数次。  

Much of finding product-market fit in tech is context and timing. And people always underestimate the market side of product-market fit.  

在技术领域寻找产品与市场的契合度很大程度上取决于背景和时机。人们总是低估产品与市场契合度的市场方面。  

When something fails, people tend to blame the product, but we should blame the market more often.  

当事情失败时，人们往往会归咎于产品，但我们更应该归咎于市场。  

The pull of the market is usually as important, if not more so, than the push from a product.  

市场的拉力通常与产品的推动力同样重要，甚至更重要。

One day, the conditions are finally right, and an idea that has failed ten times before suddenly breaks out.  

有一天，条件终于成熟，一个之前已经失败了十次的想法突然爆发。  

Sometimes it's a tweak in execution, maybe it's an advance in complementary or enabling technology, sometimes it's a cultural shift.  

有时是执行上的调整，也许是互补或支持技术的进步，有时是文化的转变。

Most of the best ideas in tech first appeared in science fiction books in the 1960s, and many of those are still waiting for their time to come.  

科技领域的大多数最佳创意都首次出现在 20 世纪 60 年代的科幻小说中，其中许多仍在等待时机的到来。  

This is why rejecting companies that are trying something that's been tried before is so dangerous. It's lazy pattern-matching.  

这就是为什么拒绝正在尝试以前尝试过的东西的公司是如此危险。这是惰性模式匹配。

I do like Jeff Bezos' principle on when he decides to finally give up on an idea: "When the last smart person in the room gives up on the idea." But it also implies that you should bring some ideas back when a new smart person, or maybe a naive overconfident one, enters the room and champions the idea.  

我确实喜欢杰夫·贝索斯在决定最终放弃一个想法时的原则：“当房间里最后一个聪明的人放弃这个想法时。”但这也意味着，当一个新的聪明人，或者可能是一个天真的过于自信的人进入房间并支持某个想法时，你应该带回一些想法。

Given we know innovation compounds as more ideas from more people collide, it's stunning how many tech firms, even ones that ostensibly tout the value of openness, have launched services that do a better job of letting their users exchange ideas than any internal tool does for their own employees’ ideas.  

鉴于我们知道，随着更多人的更多想法碰撞，创新就会复合，令人惊讶的是，有多少科技公司，甚至是那些表面上宣扬开放价值的科技公司，推出了比任何内部工具都能更好地让用户交流想法的服务。他们自己员工的想法。

How many employees join a firm and then spend a week in orientation learning where to get lunch, how to file expense reports, mundane trivialities like that.  

有多少员工加入一家公司，然后花一周的时间进行入职培训，学习在哪里吃午餐，如何提交费用报告，诸如此类的琐事。  

How many sessions are led by random trainers who don't even work at the company?  

有多少课程是由不在公司工作的随机培训师主持的？

If you think of a company as an organism, and new employees as new brain cells, it's staggering how many join the company and begin from an absolute cold start.  

如果你将公司视为一个有机体，将新员工视为新的脑细胞，那么加入公司并从绝对冷启动的人数令人震惊。  

It's as if the company has chronic amnesia. What has the company learned from its past, what is its culture?  

这家公司就好像得了慢性失忆症一样。公司从过去学到了什么，它的文化是什么？  

When employees take months or even years to get up to speed at a company, companies should be embarrassed. Instead, it's treated as normal.  

当员工需要数月甚至数年的时间才能适应公司的发展时，公司应该感到尴尬。相反，它被视为正常。

The free flow of ideas outside a company shouldn't, or in apps like TikTok, shouldn't exceed the rate at which knowledge flows inside a company, but I see it happen time and again.  

公司外部的思想自由流动不应该超过公司内部的知识流动速度，但我看到这种情况一次又一次地发生。

The toughest job for any creative is the cold start. The blinking cursor on the blank page in a new document.  

对于任何创意人员来说，最艰难的工作就是冷启动。新文档中空白页上闪烁的光标。  

Granted, writing a tweet, or even shooting an Instagram photo, isn't like composing the great American novel.  

诚然，写一条推文，甚至拍摄一张 Instagram 照片，并不像创作一部伟大的美国小说。  

But we tend to underrate the extent to which new users often churn without having ever posted anything to a social network because we only focus on those who do.  

但我们往往低估了从未在社交网络上发布过任何内容的新用户流失的程度，因为我们只关注那些在社交网络上发布过的用户。

Now imagine trying to make a TikTok from scratch if you're older than, say, 19. The creative bar is high, you don't know how to dance, you're not up on the latest memes or popular music.  

现在想象一下，如果你超过 19 岁，尝试从头开始制作 TikTok。创意门槛很高，你不知道如何跳舞，你不了解最新的模因或流行音乐。  

Even if you're a teen, it's not easy to come up with a 0 to 1 TikTok.  

即使你是一个青少年，想出一个 0 比 1 的 TikTok 也不是一件容易的事。

But the beauty of TikTok's FYP algorithm and the Discover page is that you don't have to create a TikTok from scratch.  

但 TikTok 的 FYP 算法和 Discover 页面的美妙之处在于，您不必从头开始创建 TikTok。  

The vast majority of TikToks are riffs on memes and trends that other users originate. It's no shame to be a 1 to n TikToker.  

绝大多数 TikTok 都是对其他用户发起的迷因和趋势的即兴模仿。成为一名 1 对 n TikToker 并不丢脸。  

Many on the platform achieve their first viral hit riffing on an existing meme.  

该平台上的许多人都在现有的模因上实现了他们的第一次病毒式传播。

Charli didn't invent the Renegade dance, [Jalaiah Harmon did](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html), but Charli made it famous. A lot of Charli and Addison's most popular TikToks are their interpretation of dances other people choreographed to songs other people composed.  

叛徒舞蹈并不是查莉发明的，而是贾莱亚·哈蒙发明的，但查莉让它变得出名。 Charli 和 Addison 的许多最受欢迎的 TikTok 都是他们对其他人编排的舞蹈和其他人创作的歌曲的诠释。The ongoing debate on cultural appropriation seems to have no end in sight, but at least on TikTok there is a chance, with time stamps and some of the literal links the app creates between videos, to trace the origin of memes more easily.  

关于文化挪用的持续争论似乎没有结束的迹象，但至少在 TikTok 上，通过时间戳和应用程序在视频之间创建的一些文字链接，可以更轻松地追踪模因的起源。

Richard Dawkins introduced the term meme in his classic [The Selfish Gene](https://amzn.to/3ak6uoO), defining it as a unit of information that spreads via imitation. He noted that memes evolve via natural selection just as in evolution.  

理查德·道金斯在他的经典著作《自私的基因》中引入了模因一词，将其定义为通过模仿传播的信息单位。他指出，迷因就像进化一样通过自然选择而进化。  

This memetic evolution happens via the same mechanisms as biological evolution, via _variation_, _mutation_, _competition_, and _inheritance_.  

这种模因进化通过与生物进化相同的机制发生，通过变异、突变、竞争和遗传。

The internet writ large has always been fertile ground for the accelerated breeding of memes (cue toothless old prospector: "Back in my day sonny boy we had to spread memes via email chain letters").  

显而易见，互联网一直是迷因加速繁殖的沃土（提示无牙的老探矿者：“在我那个时代，儿子，我们必须通过电子邮件连锁信传播迷因”）。  

But the TikTok app is perhaps the most evolved meme ecosystem to date.  

但 TikTok 应用程序可能是迄今为止最先进的模因生态系统。

[Assisted evolution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Assisted_evolution#:~:text=Assisted%20evolution) occurs when humans intervene to accelerate the pace of natural evolution.  

当人类干预以加速自然进化的步伐时，就会发生辅助进化。

TikTok is a form of assisted evolution in which humans and machine learning algorithms accelerate memetic evolution. The FYP algorithm is TikTok's version of [selection pressure](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Evolutionary_pressure), but it's aided by the feedback of test audiences for new TikToks.  

TikTok 是一种辅助进化形式，人类和机器学习算法加速了模因进化。 FYP 算法是 TikTok 版本的选择压力，但它得到了新 TikTok 测试受众的反馈的帮助。

Memes can start from almost anything on TikTok. It can be the lyrics of a song, or just the vibe of a track, or both. A user can post a question or a challenge.  

Meme 几乎可以从 TikTok 上的任何内容开始。它可以是一首歌的歌词，或者只是一首歌曲的氛围，或者两者兼而有之。用户可以发布问题或挑战。  

In a single session on TikTok, you'll find videos of all types, most being riffs on existing memes (the _variation_).  

在 TikTok 的单个会话中，您会发现所有类型的视频，其中大多数是对现有模因（变体）的即兴重复。

Regardless of the provenance, any video, once loaded into TikTok, is subject to the assisted evolutionary forces in the app.  

无论出处如何，任何视频一旦加载到 TikTok 中，就会受到应用程序中辅助进化力量的影响。  

Software tools like the Duet or Stitch feature and all of TikTok's other video editing tools assist in _mutation_ and _inheritance_, and each remix of a source video becomes a source video for others to remix, generating further _variation_. Meanwhile, the _competition_ on the FYP feed is fierce, and the survivors of that extreme selection pressure are memes of uncommon fitness.  

Duet 或 Stitch 功能等软件工具以及 TikTok 的所有其他视频编辑工具都有助于突变和继承，源视频的每个混音都成为其他人混音的源视频，从而产生进一步的变化。与此同时，五年计划的竞争非常激烈，在极端选择压力下的幸存者都是不寻常的健康模因。

In this assisted evolutionary ecosystem that is TikTok, and with an...umm...assist from the pandemic that kept hundreds of millions of people locked inside scrolling their phones, we've seen a marked contraction in the half-life of memes.  

在 TikTok 这个辅助进化生态系统中，在……嗯……大流行的帮助下，数亿人被锁在家里滚动手机，我们看到模因的半衰期明显缩短。

Memes used to dominate TikTok for what felt like weeks, and now it seems the memetic zeitgeist on TikTok shifts every few days, if not nightly.  

模因曾经在 TikTok 上占据主导地位长达数周之久，而现在，TikTok 上的模因时代精神似乎每隔几天（甚至每晚）就会发生变化。  

If I don't check back on TikTok every day, I find myself scrambling to catch up to the meta when I finally do open the app.  

如果我不每天查看 TikTok，当我最终打开应用程序时，我会发现自己正在努力追赶元数据。

Of course, people grab TikToks and share them on YouTube or Twitter or as Reels on Instagram, but those apps receive flattened video files and can’t break them into component parts to be remixed the way you can on TikTok.  

当然，人们会抓取 TikTok 并在 YouTube 或 Twitter 上分享，或者在 Instagram 上以 Reels 的形式分享，但这些应用程序会收到扁平化的视频文件，无法像在 TikTok 上那样将它们分解成多个组成部分进行重新混合。  

Those other services are fine endpoints for distribution, but the creativity happens on TikTok. Don't get me started on apps like Triller (which feels like a Ponzi scheme).  

这些其他服务是很好的分发端点，但创造力却发生在 TikTok 上。不要让我开始使用像 Triller 这样的应用程序（感觉就像庞氏骗局）。

People will litigate Instagram copying Snapchat's Stories feature until the end of time, but the fact is that format wasn't ever going to be some defensible moat.  

直到最后，人们都会对 Instagram 抄袭 Snapchat 的 Stories 功能提起诉讼，但事实是，这种格式永远不会成为某种可防御的护城河。  

Ephemerality is a clever new dimension on which to vary social media, but it's easily copiable.  

短暂性是改变社交媒体的一个聪明的新维度，但它很容易复制。

This is why TikTok's network effects of creativity matter. To clone TikTok, you can't just copy any single feature. It's all of that, and not just the features, but how users deploy them and how the resultant videos interact with each other on the FYP feed.  

It's replicating all the feedback loops that are built into TikTok's ecosystem, all of which are interconnected.  

它正在复制 TikTok 生态系统中内置的所有反馈循环，所有这些循环都是相互关联的。  

Maybe you can copy some of the atoms, but the magic lives at the molecular level.  

也许你可以复制一些原子，但魔法存在于分子水平。  

这就是为什么 TikTok 的创造力网络效应很重要。要克隆 TikTok，你不能仅仅复制任何单个功能。这就是所有这些，不仅仅是功能，还有用户如何部署它们以及生成的视频如何在 FYP feed 上相互交互。

TikTok has a a series of flywheels that interconnect, and there isn't any single feature you can copy to recreate the ecosystem.  

TikTok 有一系列相互连接的飞轮，没有任何单一功能可以复制来重建生态系统。  

Meanwhile, Reels has to try to compete while being one of like a half dozen things jammed into the Instagram app.  

与此同时，Reels 必须努力竞争，同时成为 Instagram 应用程序中的六种东西之一。

Markets in the internet and technology age are conducive to winner-take-all effects thanks to preferential attachment.  

互联网和科技时代的市场，由于优先依附，有利于赢者通吃的效应。  

This means that if you are first to stumble upon some flywheel  

这意味着如果您第一次偶然发现飞轮Many like my friend Kevin use the term [loops](https://kwokchain.com/tag/loops/). I use flywheel merely to indicate I'm referring to positive feedback loops since loops can also be negative feedback.  

许多人像我的朋友凯文一样使用术语“循环”。我使用飞轮只是为了表明我指的是正反馈循环，因为循环也可以是负反馈。  

Also, I had to make that damn Amazon flywheel diagram for way too many presentations back in the day, it's mounted on a wall in my brain.  

另外，我必须为当时太多的演示制作那个该死的亚马逊飞轮图，它安装在我大脑的墙上。 in your business, the returns are even greater and accumulate more quickly than they would've in any other era in history.  

在您的企业中，回报比历史上任何其他时代都更大，积累也更快。

Building a flywheel, though, often requires connecting a series of features at once.  

然而，构建飞轮通常需要同时连接一系列功能。  

When I advise various companies, big and small, I often run into objections to my recommendations because of the popularity of agile or other incremental development philosophies.  

当我为大大小小的公司提供建议时，由于敏捷或其他增量开发理念的流行，我的建议经常遭到反对。  

We end up at loggerheads on the V of MVP (minimum viable product), V having always been contextually determined.  

我们最终在 MVP（最小可行产品）的 V 上发生争执，V 始终是根据上下文确定的。

If a flywheel requires three or four or even more things to connect in your app, it takes more work to ship all of them at once, and that feels like a riskier expenditure of your team's time.  

如果飞轮需要在您的应用程序中连接三个或四个甚至更多的东西，那么一次运送所有这些东西需要更多的工作，而且这感觉像是对团队时间的冒险支出。  

But, I'd counter: 1) often, testing a flywheel by definition means you have to build multiple features that work together 2) the returns of achieving a flywheel are often so high as to be worth the risk and 3) if you don't achieve any flywheels you are, as investor updates are so fond of saying, default dead.  

但是，我会反驳：1）通常，根据定义测试飞轮意味着您必须构建多个协同工作的功能 2）实现飞轮的回报通常很高，值得冒险 3）如果您不这样做正如投资者更新时喜欢说的那样，你没有实现任何飞轮，默认已死。

Instagram famously has never had its version of resharing (e.g. retweeting).  

众所周知，Instagram 从来没有自己的转发版本（例如转发）。  

This reduced the velocity of photos and later videos on the service, a sort of brake on spam and misinformation and other possible such downsides.  

这降低了服务上照片和后来视频的速度，对垃圾邮件和错误信息以及其他可能的此类缺点起到了一定的抑制作用。

But after using TikTok, it does feel odd to go through Instagram and not be able to grab anyone's photo to remix.  

但使用 TikTok 后，通过 Instagram 却无法抓取任何人的照片进行混音，确实感觉很奇怪。  

Imagine you could grab someone's photo and apply your own filters, or grab just one element of the photo and use it in your photo.  

想象一下，您可以抓取某人的照片并应用您自己的滤镜，或者仅抓取照片的一个元素并在您的照片中使用它。

Once we all live in the metaverse, this type of infinite replication and remixability will be something we take for granted, but even now, we're starting to see an early version of it on TikTok.  

一旦我们都生活在虚拟宇宙中，这种无限复制和可重新混合性将成为我们理所当然的事情，但即使是现在，我们也开始在 TikTok 上看到它的早期版本。  

This type of native remixability feels like it will be table stakes in future creative networks.  

这种类型的原生可混合性感觉它将成为未来创意网络的筹码。

Fanfic is one text version of sampling and remixing. It doesn't require much more than your imagination.  

Fanfic 是一种采样和混音的文本版本。它不需要比你的想象力更多的东西。

It's always been really expensive, in both time and legal costs, to sample and remix film and television.  

电影和电视的采样和混音一直非常昂贵，无论是时间还是法律成本。  

TikTok has, with its short video format and tools, made remixing of premium video easier and safer.  

TikTok 凭借其短视频格式和工具，使优质视频的混音变得更加容易和安全。  

In Harry Potter TikTok, and its sub-genus Draco Malfoy TikTok, creators pull from the repository of the Harry Potter film universe as if it were on GitHub and merge themselves into branching storylines in which, well, creators become students at Hogwarts and catch the romantic interests of one Draco Malfoy.  

在哈利·波特 TikTok 及其子属德拉科·马尔福 TikTok 中，创作者从哈利·波特电影世界的存储库中提取内容，就好像它在 GitHub 上一样，并将自己合并到分支故事情节中，在这些故事情节中，创作者成为霍格沃茨的学生并赶上德拉科·马尔福之一的浪漫兴趣。

The Discover page acts as the Fed in the central economy of memes on TikTok, while the FYP algorithm is the interest rate on meme distribution.  

Discover页面充当了TikTok上meme中央经济中的美联储，而FYP算法则是meme分布上的利率。

The Discover Page features hashtags.  

发现页面具有主题标签。  

By the very act of featuring a hashtag, they signal to creators that if they create using that hashtag, they will get the distribution boost of that hashtag being featured on the Discover Page.  

通过使用主题标签的行为，他们向创作者发出信号，如果他们使用该主题标签进行创作，他们将获得发现页面上显示的该主题标签的分发提升。  

Which raises the age-old conundrum, which came first, the Discover Page hashtag placement, or the hashtag's trending? The answer is yes. It's circular, an ouroboros of virality.  

这提出了一个古老的难题，是“发现页面”主题标签的放置，还是主题标签的趋势，哪个先出现？答案是肯定的。它是圆形的，是病毒式传播的衔尾蛇。

TikTok also posts the number of collective views on videos with that hashtag, helping creators gauge the potential distribution value of climbing aboard that trend.  

TikTok 还发布了带有该主题标签的视频的集体观看次数，帮助创作者衡量顺应这一趋势的潜在发行价值。

TikTok is a mix of a centrally planned economy and a free market, much like many multiplayer video games where the game publisher manages the price and availability of various assets like weapons and armor while the players put them to use in the virtual economy.  

TikTok 是中央计划经济和自由市场的混合体，就像许多多人视频游戏一样，游戏发行商管理武器和盔甲等各种资产的价格和可用性，而玩家则将它们用于虚拟经济。

The Discover Page is also where TikTok will feature corporate challenges. Yes, it's a paid placement, but the creative output is collective and distributed.  

探索页面也是 TikTok 展示企业挑战的地方。是的，这是一个付费展示位置，但创意输出是集体和分布式的。

Because the most popular memes get super-distribution via the FYP algorithm, you can assume common knowledge of the meme among your viewers and just cut to the punchline.  

因为最流行的模因通过 FYP 算法获得超级分布，所以您可以假设观众对模因有共同的了解，然后直接切入要点。  

You don't need a bunch of what would be the video equivalent of exposition upfront.  

您不需要预先进行大量相当于视频演示的内容。  

This keeps the majority of videos on TikTok compact, critical to the high cadence of the FYP feed. TikTok feels fast. Almost manic.  

这使得 TikTok 上的大部分视频保持紧凑，这对于 FYP feed 的高节奏至关重要。 TikTok 感觉很快。几乎狂躁。

It also gives viewers that hit of in-group dopamine when they already know the references in your video.  

当观众已经知道您视频中的参考内容时，它还会为观众带来群体内多巴胺的冲击。

If you don't understand a TikTok video and its references, you can trace the provenance from within the app in any number of ways.  

如果您不理解 TikTok 视频及其参考，您可以通过多种方式从应用程序内追踪其出处。  

You can follow the hashtags in the caption or tap the sound icon and see all the other videos which have been made in that meme branch. Often that's enough to derive the context.  

您可以按照标题中的主题标签或点击声音图标来查看该模因分支中制作的所有其他视频。通常这足以得出上下文。

Or you can just read the comments.  

或者你也可以直接阅读评论。  

You'll find you usually aren't alone, someone will almost always have posted a comment like "In here before the smart people arrive" and then below that will be comments that explain the video to everyone else.  

您会发现您通常并不孤单，有人几乎总是会发布诸如“在聪明人到达之前就在这里”之类的评论，然后下面将是向其他人解释视频的评论。

The internet, and the assumption of the internet, allowed for more complex and long linear narratives in television, shows like Lost and Game of Thrones.  

互联网以及互联网的假设使得电视、《迷失》和《权力的游戏》等节目中出现更复杂和更长的线性叙事。  

The assumption of Know Your Meme, or just knowledgeable commenters in the TikTok comments, allows for less expository and more compact, obscure TikToks.  

“了解你的模因”的假设，或者只是 TikTok 评论中知识渊博的评论者的假设，允许更少的解释性和更紧凑、晦涩的 TikTok。  

TikTok comments are a form of distributed annotation.  

TikTok 评论是分布式注释的一种形式。

This technique of offloading the setup for a joke to the internet allows TikTok's, or even Tweets or Instagram posts to take on a form of what I call compressed narrative.  

这种将笑话的设置转移到互联网上的技术使得 TikTok、甚至推文或 Instagram 帖子能够呈现出一种我称之为压缩叙事的形式。

The old format of a joke, with a setup—A man walks into the doctor's office wearing only underwear made of Saran wrap—and then the punchline—and the doctor said "I can clearly see your nuts."—is dead.  

旧的笑话格式——一个男人只穿着保鲜膜制成的内衣走进医生办公室——然后是妙语——医生说“我可以清楚地看到你的坚果。”——已经死了。  

The internet killed the "joke."  

互联网杀死了这个“笑话”。

Instead, the internet is mostly punchline, with the barest of setup, if any. It's on you to know the context. Go Google it.  

相反，互联网大多是妙语连珠，只有最基本的设置（如果有的话）。你需要了解上下文。去谷歌吧。

And if you still don't get it, you weren't meant to.  

如果你还是不明白，那说明你本来就不该明白。

An example is the "I ain't ever seen two pretty best friends" meme that went around on TikTok for a hot minute and has since just become a base trope of the TikTok creative universe.  

一个例子是“我从来没有见过两个漂亮的好朋友”模因，它在 TikTok 上流行了一段时间，此后就成为 TikTok 创意世界的基本比喻。  

Videos started taking more and more circuitous routes to end with that punchline, throwing all sorts of sleight of hands before dropping it, out of nowhere, like an M.  

视频开始采取越来越迂回的路线来结束这句妙语，在扔掉它之前施展各种花招，不知从何而来，就像一个M。  

Night Shyamalan film twist.  

奈特·沙马兰电影转折。

If you hadn't heard of the meme or didn't know the reference, these videos would be complete mysteries.  

如果您没有听说过这个模因或不知道参考资料，那么这些视频将完全是个谜。  

Even now, if you don't know what I'm talking about, this section will make no sense. Nor will comments like "We found the two pretty best friends" on various videos.  

即使现在，如果您不知道我在说什么，那么本节就毫无意义。各种视频中类似“我们找到了两个最好的朋友”之类的评论也不会出现。

One of the better pieces I read last year was this [on the death of political humor in the age of Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/magazine/trump-liberal-comedy-tv.html).  

我去年读过的最好的文章之一是关于特朗普时代政治幽默之死的文章。  

My favorite turn of phrase from the piece is that "Irony in politics, meanwhile, has reversed its polarity." David Foster Wallace predicted the death of irony, of cynicism, after an initial boom when the internet was coming of age.  

这篇文章中我最喜欢的措辞是“与此同时，政治中的讽刺已经扭转了它的极性。”大卫·福斯特·华莱士（David Foster Wallace）预言，在互联网成熟时的最初繁荣之后，讽刺和愤世嫉俗将会消亡。  

The lament of the humorist is that figures like Trump are beyond the reach of irony because they are already satires of themselves.  

幽默家的哀叹是，像特朗普这样的人物是无法讽刺的，因为他们已经是对自己的讽刺。I often lament when I refer to as [fortune cookie Twitter](https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/998714814749802496), and to combat this, I think Twitter should set up a GPT-3 bot that constantly trains on each account, and the moment most of your followers can no longer distinguish between the GPT-3 spoof of your account and your actual account, you should be forced to vacate your account and allow the GPT-3 bot to replace you.  

当我将 Twitter 称为幸运饼干时，我经常感叹，为了解决这个问题，我认为 Twitter 应该建立一个 GPT-3 机器人，不断地对每个帐户进行训练，而当你的大多数关注者无法再区分 GPT 时， 3 欺骗您的帐户和您的实际帐户，您应该被迫腾出您的帐户并让 GPT-3 机器人取代您。  

You will have literally become a parody of yourself.  

你实际上会成为你自己的模仿者。  

Also, if for some reason I ever hacked my way into a famous person's account, my goal would not to be to request BTC or post something offensive.  

另外，如果出于某种原因我曾经侵入过名人的帐户，我的目标不会是索要 BTC 或发布一些攻击性的内容。  

Instead, my goal would be to post a tweet that so resembles their voice that no one, not even the person who owned that account, could tell.  

相反，我的目标是发布一条与他们的声音如此相似的推文，以至于没有人，甚至拥有该帐户的人，都无法分辨。  

They'd just think, wow, that's strange, I don't remember posting that, but it is something I'd post, so ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯  

他们只是想，哇，这很奇怪，我不记得发布过这个，但这是我发布的内容，所以 ́\_(ツ)\_/̊

To me, humor has always depended on creating a gap and then helping your audience to hurdle it. In a traditional joke, the gap is the space between the setup and the punchline.  

对我来说，幽默始终取决于创造差距，然后帮助观众跨越它。在传统的笑话中，间隙是设置和妙语之间的空间。  

When the audience's mind comprehends the joke, they soar across that gap, and the exhilaration is released as laughter.  

当观众的头脑理解了这个笑话时，他们就飞越了那个鸿沟，兴奋感以笑声的形式释放出来。  

You don't want to carry them across, you want to do just enough to let them take that last leap themselves.  

你不想背着他们过去，你只想做足够的事情让他们自己迈出最后的一步。

A comedian like Chris Rock will take something from real life and just point out the hidden social truth beneath it, and your mind gets that dopamine hit of acknowledging a social fiction that you'd otherwise observe without question.  

像克里斯·洛克这样的喜剧演员会从现实生活中汲取一些东西，并指出其背后隐藏的社会真相，你的大脑会因为承认社会小说而受到多巴胺的刺激，否则你会毫无疑问地观察到。  

Like Moses, comedians part the sea of taboo and let you stroll through, laughing all the way at being able to get away with it.  

像摩西一样，喜剧演员将禁忌之海分开，让你漫步其中，一路大笑，因为能够逃脱惩罚。

Pre-cancellation Louis C.K. also lived in this space, exposing something of your nature that you were embarrassed to acknowledge.  

预取消 Louis C.K.也生活在这个空间里，暴露了你本性中的一些你不好意思承认的东西。  

Either he'd absolve you of your shame by absorbing it all himself in a performance of self-loathing, or he'd just forgive you that fault by making it seem universal.  

要么他会通过自我厌恶的表现来吸收你的耻辱，从而免除你的耻辱，要么他会通过让你的错误看起来很普遍来原谅你的错误。  

Comedians let you look at yourself from outside yourself, creating a gap between you and your own nature.  

喜剧演员让你从外部审视自己，在你和你自己的本性之间制造出一道鸿沟。

Trump killed humor by closing that gap entirely, becoming such a parody of himself that shows like Veep seemed less dark satire than some form of fatuous cosplay even though they came first.  

特朗普完全消除了这种差距，从而扼杀了幽默感，成为了对自己的模仿，以至于像《副总统》这样的节目似乎不像黑暗讽刺，而是某种形式的愚蠢的角色扮演，尽管它们是第一位的。

But humor is not so easily killed. You just need new ways to restore the comedic gap.  

但幽默并不那么容易被扼杀。你只需要新的方法来弥补喜剧差距。  

Much of TikTok humor is oblique in form, making references that flatter you if you understand them and puzzle you if you don't.  

TikTok 的大部分幽默在形式上都是拐弯抹角的，如果你理解它们，它们就会让你感到高兴；如果你不理解它们，就会让你感到困惑。  

But for the latter, you then must set off on a journey to traverse that gap.  

但对于后者，你就必须踏上跨越这个鸿沟的旅程。  

And when you've completed that journey, you get the delayed satisfaction of getting the joke but also the pleasure of now being in the in-group.  

当你完成这个旅程时，你会得到延迟的满足感，因为听到笑话，但也有现在加入团体的乐趣。

But more sophisticated creators can also play with that expectation, setting off on what seems like a familiar meme, then subverting audience expectations.  

但更老练的创作者也可以利用这种期望，引发看似熟悉的模因，然后颠覆观众的期望。

Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, from the same parent company Bytedance, provides an interesting contrast in the styles of humor between China and America.  

抖音是 TikTok 的中国版，来自同一家母公司字节跳动，它在中美幽默风格上形成了有趣的对比。

A lot of comedic videos in China use a laugh track sound effect. I can't remember the last time I heard a laugh track in a TikTok.  

中国很多喜剧视频都使用笑声音效。我不记得上次在 TikTok 中听到笑声是什么时候了。

I want to draw some conclusion here, but I don't feel confident enough. Someone more familiar with the cultural differences in Chinese and American humor might clarify this for me.  

我想在这里得出一些结论，但我觉得不够自信。更熟悉中美幽默文化差异的人可能会为我澄清这一点。

Netflix brings international programs to the U.S. TikTok brings some Chinese programming to the States also.  

Netflix 将国际节目带到美国。TikTok 也将一些中国节目带到美国。

TikToker [@funcolle](https://www.tiktok.com/@funcolle?lang=en) makes a sort of hyper-compressed episodic detective series that is filmed in China and spoken in Mandarin, but it works on U.S. TikTok thanks to onscreen subtitles.  

TikToker @funcolle 制作了一种超压缩的情景侦探连续剧，在中国拍摄并用普通话进行讲述，但由于屏幕字幕，它可以在美国 TikTok 上播放。  

The sound she uses is, by now, as memorable to me as the theme song to any number of popular TV series like Game of Thrones.  

到目前为止，她使用的声音对我来说就像《权力的游戏》等许多流行电视剧的主题曲一样令人难忘。

If you can't solve these really short single TikTok video mysteries, you can turn to the comments section to get help from all the other viewers who've pored over the videos in detail and raced to post the solution.  

如果您无法解开这些非常短的单个 TikTok 视频之谜，您可以转到评论部分，向所有其他观看者寻求帮助，他们详细研究了视频并竞相发布解决方案。

One measure of a platform's power is the number of things people make with it that you had never been made before.  

衡量一个平台的力量的一个标准是人们用它制作了以前从未制作过的东西的数量。  

Every week, I find videos on TikTok that I can't imagine having been made on any other app.  

每周，我都会在 TikTok 上找到一些我无法想象是在任何其他应用程序上制作的视频。

Funcolle (@funcolle) has created a short video on TikTok with music original sound. | Anything wrong with this room? Come on, my detectives!#foryou  

Funcolle (@funcolle) 在 TikTok 上制作了一段带有音乐原声的短视频。 |这个房间有什么问题吗？来吧，我的侦探们！#foryou

On TikTok, the comments have become creative terrain in their own right. Somewhere along the line, riffing on someone else's TikTok no longer required you to make a TikTok.  

在 TikTok 上，评论本身已经成为创意领域。渐渐地，模仿别人的 TikTok 不再需要你制作 TikTok。  

Instead, you can just go into the comments and tack on a punchline to the punchline of the video and rack up hundreds of thousands of likes.  

相反，你可以直接进入评论，在视频的亮点上添加一个妙语，然后获得数十万个赞。  

Writing the most clever comment on a TikTok video has become its own art form.  

在 TikTok 视频上写最聪明的评论已经成为一种独特的艺术形式。

I can't remember the last time I watched a good TikTok video without then opening up the comments to see what the peanut gallery came up with.  

我不记得上次观看精彩的 TikTok 视频而不打开评论看看花生画廊想出什么东西是什么时候了。  

Sometimes I read the comments before even finishing the video. TikTok's method of ranking comments almost always surfaces the best and most relevant comments to the top.  

有时我什至在完成视频之前就阅读了评论。 TikTok 的评论排名方法几乎总是将最好、最相关的评论排在最前面。  

However you feel about a video, it's uncanny how often one of the top five comments encapsulates it perfectly.  

无论您对某个视频有什么看法，令人难以置信的是，排名前五的评论之一经常完美地概括了它。

It's difficult in a video to feel the presence of other viewers in a tangible, meaningful way.  

在视频中很难以切实、有意义的方式感受到其他观看者的存在。  

The Twitch comment bar gives you a visible if somewhat bewildering waterfall of text as evidence of their presence, and the hearts on something like an Instagram Live or the bullet comments on Bilibili videos do the same.  

Twitch 评论栏为您提供了可见但有些令人困惑的文本瀑布，作为其存在的证据，Instagram Live 上的红心或 Bilibili 视频上的子弹评论也有同样的效果。

TikTok comments, though, feel ike they extend the canvas of the video.  

不过，TikTok 的评论让人感觉它们扩展了视频的画布。  

Just as talent shows like The Voice require both contestants and voices to work, more and more it feels as if the TikTok experience is about watching the performers and then listening to the judges (all of us viewers) render their opinions via the comments.  

就像《The Voice》这样的选秀节目需要参赛者和声音共同发挥作用一样，TikTok 的体验越来越让人感觉就是观看表演者，然后聆听评委（我们所有观众）通过评论发表他们的意见。  

There isn't one Simon Cowell on TikTok, but in any comments section of any TikTok video, someone will play that role.  

TikTok 上没有西蒙·考威尔，但在任何 TikTok 视频的任何评论部分，都会有人扮演这个角色。

Never read the comments. Unless you're on TikTok, in which case, always read the comments.  

从来不看评论。除非你在使用 TikTok，在这种情况下，请务必阅读评论。

Reading the comments on TikTok serves a communal function. It's like hearing the laughter of the crowd at a comedy show.  

阅读 TikTok 上的评论有一项公共功能。就像在喜剧表演中听到人群的笑声一样。

One of the existential challenges of life is truly connecting with other people's thoughts.  

生活中存在的挑战之一是真正与他人的思想相联系。  

Who can ever know that series of emotions and thoughts and dreams we call our consciousness? True human connection seems always out of grasp.  

谁能知道我们称之为意识的一系列情感、思想和梦想？真正的人际关系似乎总是难以把握。

The pandemic exacerbates that sense of isolation.  

大流行加剧了这种孤立感。  

When most of our interactions are with flat faces on video screens, it feels either like we're living in a simulation or some solipsistic nightmare.  

当我们大多数的互动都是在视频屏幕上与平面进行交互时，感觉我们要么生活在模拟中，要么生活在某种唯我论的噩梦中。

Before I check the comments on a TikTok I've just watched, I almost always have a strong reaction to that video.  

在查看我刚刚观看的 TikTok 上的评论之前，我几乎总是对该视频有强烈的反应。  

That's why opening the comments and finding that one of the first few comments perfectly encapsulates your reaction, then seeing it already has tens or hundreds of thousands of likes, is so comforting.  

这就是为什么打开评论并发现前几条评论之一完美地概括了您的反应，然后看到它已经有数万或数十万个赞，这是如此令人欣慰。

This confirmation of a shared response creates, asynchronously, a passing score on a form of the Voight-Kampff test. It's a checksum on your humanity.

  

对共享响应的确认会异步创建 Voight-Kampff 测试形式的及格分数。这是对你人性的检验。

Many comments have begun using the inclusive second person singular, literally speaking for the rest of the viewers.  

许多评论已经开始使用包容性的第二人称单数，字面上是为其他观众说话。  

These comments often begin with "POV:" as in "POV: You're lying bed at 2am scrolling TikTok." It's presumptive, and yet the best TikToks evoke such a consistent multiple-choice checklist of responses that it's rare the times I can think of an original comment that isn't already posted above the fold.  

这些评论通常以“POV：”开头，如“POV：你凌晨 2 点躺在床上滚动 TikTok”。这是假设性的，但最好的 TikTok 会引发如此一致的多项选择反应清单，以至于我很少能想到尚未发布在首屏的原始评论。

The sense of collective response in TikTok comments and the publicly visible view and like counts have been around long enough that users now assume enough others have encountered enough of the same memes despite everyone's FYP algorithm being tailored to their individual tastes.  

TikTok 评论中的集体反应感以及公开可见的观看次数和点赞数已经存在了足够长的时间，以至于用户现在认为足够多的其他人已经遇到了足够多的相同模因，尽管每个人的 FYP 算法都是根据他们的个人喜好量身定制的。  

Many a comment on a viral TikTok will read like "Oh we're back here again."  

许多关于病毒式传播的 TikTok 的评论会是这样的：“哦，我们又回来了。”

Though I have said that TikTok isn't a social network—I don't know most people on the app, I don't have to follow anyone to have a good experience—the algorithm does create, through its [efficient sorting](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat), a sense of traveling through subcultural neighborhoods as you scroll down one TikTok at a time.  

尽管我说过 TikTok 不是一个社交网络——我不认识该应用程序上的大多数人，我不必关注任何人就能获得良好的体验——该算法确实通过其高效的排序创造了一种感觉一次滚动一个 TikTok，穿越亚文化社区。

Users have adopted spatial or geographic language to describe this sense of shared viewing spaces. Various subcultures are described by appending -tok or TikTok behind a descriptor.  

用户采用空间或地理语言来描述这种共享观看空间的感觉。通过在描述符后面附加 -tok 或 TikTok 来描述各种亚文化。  

Someone commenting on a particularly high-quality video might say "I've finally gotten Premium TikTok." People share weird niches they're on by saying things like "I'm deep into carpet cleaning tok" or "I don't know how but I've found music theory tok." Sometimes it's just one word, like "Sportstok or Liberaltok." Tok has almost come to be a suffix meaning "neighborhood" or "community," almost like Disney uses -land to describe themed areas in its parks like Frontierland or Tomorrowland.  

有人在评论特别高质量的视频时可能会说“我终于获得了 Premium TikTok”。人们通过说“我很喜欢地毯清洁托克”或“我不知道怎么做，但我找到了音乐理论托克”之类的话来分享他们所从事的奇怪的利基市场。有时只是一个词，例如“Sportstok 或 Liberaltok”。 Tok 几乎已经成为一个后缀，意为“邻里”或“社区”，就像迪士尼使用 -land 来描述其公园中的主题区域（例如 Frontierland 或 Tomorrowland）一样。

Of course, we're all just in our FYP feeds, which just scrolls up endlessly, so it isn't an actual space.  

当然，我们都只是在我们的 FYP feed 中，它只是无限地向上滚动，所以它不是一个实际的空间。  

But we trust the visible view counts as evidence FYP is doing its job getting many of us with the same tastes in front of the same videos, and so this evidence of common knowledge creates a liminal third place that exists \[_waves hands at the air in front of me_\] out there.  

但我们相信，可见的观看次数可以作为证据，《FYP》正在尽其所能，让我们中的许多人在相同的视频面前拥有相同的品味，因此，这种常识的证据创造了一个有限的第三位，存在\[在空中挥手\]在我面前\]在那里。

I’ve tended to think of social networks as being built by people assembling a graph of people bottoms up, but perhaps I’ve been too narrow-minded.  

我倾向于认为社交网络是由人们自下而上组装人员图表而建立的，但也许我的心胸太狭隘了。  

TikTok might not qualify by that definition, but it feels social, with FYP as village matchmaker.  

TikTok 可能不符合这个定义，但它感觉很社交，FYP 充当了乡村媒人。

There's been a lot written on Warner Media's decision to move some films from theatrical only windows to having a concurrent release on HBO Max.  

关于华纳媒体决定将部分电影从院线影院转移到 HBO Max 同步上映的决定，已有很多文章报道。  

A lot of conclusions were drawn about theatrical's future based on Wonder Woman 84’s Christmas premiere in theaters and on HBO Max day-and-date.  

根据《神奇女侠 84》的圣诞节首映以及 HBO Max 的日期和日期，人们对戏剧的未来得出了很多结论。  

A lot of it is the usual knee jerk extrapolation that the internet is famous for, despite confounding circumstances like a pandemic, and despite Wonder Woman 84 being a single data point.  

尽管存在流行病等令人困惑的情况，尽管神奇女侠 84 是一个单一的数据点，但其中很多都是互联网上著名的下意识推断。

But one thing I'm confident of is that something is lost in not having the audible feedback of a hundred or more humans around you when you watch something, especially from genres that are built to elicit frequent emotional feedback, like comedies and horror films. At some point, perhaps we'll crack the nut on social viewing and how to make it more, umm, social, but for now, pre-VR metaverse, it's a shoddy facsimile of a crowd.  

但我确信的一件事是，当你观看某些东西时，如果没有周围一百个或更多人的声音反馈，就会失去一些东西，特别是那些旨在引发频繁情感反馈的类型，如喜剧和恐怖电影。在某些时候，也许我们会解决社交观看问题，以及如何让它变得更加社交化，但就目前而言，在虚拟现实之前的虚拟世界中，它只是人群的劣质复制品。

Look, I've streamed my share of concerts during this past year, and I don't miss standing for an hour between sets in a crowded club or bar, nursing a $9 beer in a plastic cup, waiting for my band of choice to get on stage.  

看，在过去的一年里，我直播了我的音乐会，我不会错过在拥挤的俱乐部或酒吧里，在演出间隙站上一个小时，喝着装在塑料杯里的 9 美元啤酒，等待我选择的乐队上场。上台。

And yet, I miss standing in that bar, my shoes sticking to the beer-soaked floor, trying to look at ease in my own skin while gawking at other humans.  

然而，我怀念站在那个酒吧里，我的鞋子粘在被啤酒浸透的地板上，一边盯着其他人一边试图让自己看起来轻松自在。

In a year where we've been trapped inside for nearly a year now, there's something about the chaotic collectivist media art form that is TikTok that felt most joyful and genuine.  

在我们被困在里面近一年的一年里，TikTok 这种混乱的集体主义媒体艺术形式让人感到最快乐和真实。

Thumbing through the FYP feed one portrait-oriented rectangle at a time felt like swiping from one bedroom window to the next on a tall skyscraper, peering into one user's bedroom after another (literally, as the bedroom is the most common space in which teens do their creative work).  

翻阅 FYP 时，一次输入一个纵向矩形，感觉就像在高耸的摩天大楼上从一个卧室的窗户滑到另一个卧室，凝视一个又一个用户的卧室（从字面上看，因为卧室是青少年最常见的空间）他们的创造性工作）。  

It's like a Chris Ware comic strip, with its architectural design, navigated one window pane at a time.  

这就像克里斯·威尔（Chris Ware）的漫画，其建筑设计一次导航一个窗玻璃。

Because it's full screen, it can feel like my phone screen is literally a rectangular porthole.  

因为它是全屏的，所以感觉我的手机屏幕实际上是一个矩形舷窗。  

As if one user after another is hijacking my rear-facing camera and turning it into their rear or front-facing camera.  

就好像一个又一个用户劫持我的后置摄像头并将其变成他们的后置或前置摄像头。

There's something about media like TikTok or ChatRoulette or Omegle, where so much of what you see is a creator directly addressing the camera, breaking the fourth wall from the start, that is immediately intimate.  

像 TikTok、ChatRoulette 或 Omegle 这样的媒体，你看到的很多内容都是创作者直接对着镜头讲话，从一开始就打破了第四面墙，这让你立即感到亲密。

One thing I wish TikTok would do is make it easier to trace multi-part videos from creators.  

我希望 TikTok 做的一件事是让追踪创作者的多部分视频变得更加容易。  

Nothing drives me crazier than videos that end with "Stay tuned for Part 2" or "Like for Part 2" and then you spend like ten minutes browsing their profile trying to find the second part.  

没有什么比以“敬请期待第 2 部分”或“喜欢第 2 部分”结尾的视频更让我疯狂的了，然后你花了大约十分钟浏览他们的个人资料试图找到第二部分。

I understand that it's a sort of view count hack on the part of creators, but some videos do need to be broken up across installments.  

我知道这是创作者的一种观看次数黑客行为，但有些视频确实需要分期进行。  

TikTok needs to add some sort of concept of a pointer or link to make it easier to jump directly to the next installment in a series.  

TikTok 需要添加某种指针或链接的概念，以便更容易直接跳转到系列中的下一部分。  

Perhaps it could be done via a playlist feature.  

也许可以通过播放列表功能来完成。

For now, the best way to trace linked videos is to visually scan the thumbnails on a person's profile and search for onscreen text reading "Part #" or just click on every video with the same visual grammar, the user in the same outfit in the same room with the same lighting.  

目前，追踪链接视频的最佳方法是直观地扫描某人个人资料上的缩略图，并搜索屏幕上的文字“第 # 部分”，或者只需单击具有相同视觉语法的每个视频，即用户在视频中穿着相同的服装。同一个房间，同样的灯光。

(Since I wrote the note above, the app has added a way to highlight, on a creator's profile page, the video you just watched, and since videos are sorted reverse chronologically by creation date on the profile, often part II can be found next to the video you just watched, which is handy).  

（自从我写了上面的注释以来，该应用程序添加了一种在创建者的个人资料页面上突出显示您刚刚观看的视频的方法，并且由于视频在个人资料上按创建日期按时间顺序反向排序，因此通常可以在接下来找到第二部分到您刚刚观看的视频，这很方便）。

In another example of the community coming up with creative solutions, commenters on the first in a multi-part video series where the next part has yet to be published will now leave a comment saying that they'll promise to tag people who like their comment once the next installment is posted.  

在社区提出创意解决方案的另一个例子中，多部分视频系列中第一部分的评论者（下一部分尚未发布）现在将发表评论，表示他们将承诺标记喜欢他们评论的人一旦发布下一部分。  

In other words, users are serving as Mechanical Turk notification bots.  

换句话说，用户充当 Mechanical Turk 通知机器人。

Another feature I wish TikTok would add is the ability to sort by descending popularity on any grid of videos, like on sound or profile pages. Please.  

我希望 TikTok 添加的另一个功能是能够对任何视频网格（例如声音或个人资料页面）上的受欢迎程度进行降序排序。请。

TikTok's needs to improve its search ranking algorithm.  

TikTok 需要改进其搜索排名算法。  

Trying to find popular TikTok's I remembered seeing back in the day was much harder than it should have been using TikTok's native search.  

我记得当时试图找到流行的 TikTok 比使用 TikTok 的本地搜索要困难得多。  

A couple that I wanted to use I just couldn't locate, and even Google and YouTube didn't turn them up (a thing you realize after trying to do it more than once is how hard it is to create a comprehensible search query for certain TikTok's).  

有几个我想使用的但找不到，甚至 Google 和 YouTube 也没有找到它们（在多次尝试之后你会意识到，为以下内容创建一个可理解的搜索查询是多么困难）某些 TikTok 的）。

Network effects are powerful, but there are so many distinct types.  

网络效应很强大，但有很多不同的类型。  

It's important to understand exactly what type of network effect you have because they all scale and operate differently.  

准确了解您所拥有的网络效应类型非常重要，因为它们的规模和运作方式都不同。

For example, [Dunbar's number](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dunbar%27s_number) is just one form of limit on a very specific type of network effect. But there are dozens and dozens of network effects, all with their distinct quirks.  

例如，邓巴数只是对一种非常特定类型的网络效应的限制的一种形式。但网络效应有几十种，而且都有各自独特的特点。  

Someone could make a lot of money just making a reference book of the taxonomy of network effect varietals in the world.  

有人只需制作一本世界网络效应品种分类学的参考书就可以赚很多钱。

TikTok is an extreme experiment in not only making creative network effects endogenous to its app but to the medium of video.  

TikTok 是一项极端的实验，它不仅使创意网络效应内生于其应用程序，还内生于视频媒体。  

Like some video Minecraft, almost everything in the app is a replicable chunk of bits that you can combine into a larger configuration of bits, and the resulting creation becomes, itself, a chunk that anyone can take and splice or mutate or combine however they want.  

就像一些视频《我的世界》一样，应用程序中的几乎所有内容都是可复制的比特块，您可以将其组合成更大的比特配置，而最终的创作本身就成为任何人都可以按照自己的意愿进行拼接、变异或组合的块。

This is anathema to old media, most of whom have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lock up their content behind copyright law, DRM, and any number of other mechanisms meant to slow the rate of reproduction and iteration of their work.  

这对旧媒体来说是令人厌恶的，他们中的大多数人花费了数亿美元将其内容锁定在版权法、DRM 和任何其他旨在减慢其作品的复制和迭代速度的机制之后。  

It has the effect of slowing the evolutionary feedback loops on all of that work.  

它具有减缓所有这些工作的进化反馈循环的效果。

TikTok's "OODA loop" is collective and distributed, and it spins thousands of times faster than that of big media.  

TikTok的“OODA循环”是集体性的、分布式的，其旋转速度比大媒体快数千倍。

When I first joined the Amazon Web Services team in 2003, it was still a small Jeff Bezos-sponsored project.  

当我 2003 年第一次加入 Amazon Web Services 团队时，它还是一个由 Jeff Bezos 赞助的小型项目。  

There were only some 15 people or so on the team at the time under the leadership of now Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.  

当时，在现任亚马逊首席执行官安迪·贾西 (Andy Jassy) 的领导下，团队只有 15 人左右。

A book Jeff had us read, one which he said should serve as an inspiration for how we'd design AWS, was [Creation: Life and How to Make It](https://amzn.to/3poAKmI) by Steve Grand.  

Jeff 让我们读过一本书，他说这本书应该为我们如何设计 AWS 提供灵感，这本书是 Steve Grand 写的《创造：生活和如何创造它》。  

It's a book about programming artificial life, but the core principle that Jeff wanted us to take from it was the idea that complex things like life forms are built from very simple building blocks or primitives.  

这是一本关于人工生命编程的书，但杰夫希望我们从中汲取的核心原则是，像生命形式这样的复杂事物是由非常简单的构建块或基元构建而成的。  

It's the same thesis as that in Stephen Wolfram's [A New Kind of Science](https://amzn.to/3b7TWjy).  

这与斯蒂芬·沃尔夫勒姆（Stephen Wolfram）的《一种新科学》中的论点相同。

The key implication for AWS from the book was about how to design the first AWS primitives. Jeff urged us to include only what was necessary and nothing more.  

本书对 AWS 的主要启示是如何设计第一个 AWS 原语。杰夫敦促我们只包含必要的内容，仅此而已。  

If you were designing a storage service, like S3, you'd need functions like get, write, delete, but you wouldn't want to layer in things that weren't part of storage, like security.  

如果您正在设计一个存储服务，例如 S3，您需要诸如获取、写入、删除之类的功能，但您不希望分层添加不属于存储一部分的功能，例如安全性。

That should be a separate primitive.

  

那应该是一个单独的原语。

The reason to design your primitives with the utmost elegance is to maximize combinatorial optionality.  

以最优雅的方式设计基元的原因是为了最大化组合的可选性。

This is one of the most elegant things about TikTok's design. It includes a ton of primitives, and they are almost all ones you can combine or link.  

这是 TikTok 设计中最优雅的事情之一。它包含大量原语，并且它们几乎都是您可以组合或链接的原语。

More than that, every element in a TikTok is a building block you can replicate and use in your own TikTok. The most important of these is the soundtrack or sound of your TikTok.  

不仅如此，TikTok 中的每个元素都是您可以在自己的 TikTok 中复制和使用的构建块。其中最重要的是 TikTok 的配乐或声音。

Be careful of taking this idea of building primitives too far.  

小心不要将构建基元的想法走得太远。  

In many ways, choosing what level of abstraction to stake your ground on is one of the most important questions any company must answer.  

从很多方面来说，选择哪种抽象级别是任何公司必须回答的最重要的问题之一。

The answer is contextual. Abstract at too high a level and someone can come in beneath you, with something like AWS. In some ways this is a form of disruption.  

答案是结合上下文的。如果抽象的层次太高，有人可能会使用 AWS 之类的东西来低于你。从某些方面来说，这是一种破坏。

Build at too low a level, however, and often someone will abstract at a level above you and siphon all the value of that market above your product.  

然而，构建的水平太低，通常有人会在高于你的水平上进行抽象，并吸走高于你产品的市场的所有价值。  

Many of TikTok’s filters are abstractions of a lot of things, almost like Lightroom Presets.  

TikTok 的许多过滤器都是很多东西的抽象，几乎就像 Lightroom 预设一样。  

As many of us learned early in this pandemic, maybe paying a few bucks for a loaf of bread is preferable to having to spend hours of our free time mastering baking.  

正如我们许多人在这场大流行初期了解到的那样，也许花几美元买一条面包比花几个小时的空闲时间掌握烘焙更好。

When I think about modern remix culture and apps like TikTok, I often think back to Mixel, an app designer Khoi Vinh launched years ago. It was an iPad collage app.  

当我想到现代混音文化和 TikTok 这样的应用程序时，我经常会想起 Mixel，这是一款应用程序设计者 Khoi Vinh 几年前推出的应用程序。这是一款 iPad 拼贴应用程序。

In his [blog post](https://www.subtraction.com/2011/11/10/introducing-mixel/) introducing Mixel, Vinh wrote:

Though Mixel is no longer around, what he describes presages modern meme culture and TikTok.  

尽管 Mixel 已不复存在，但他所描述的内容预示着现代模因文化和 TikTok。

Inherent to digital culture is the remix.  

数字文化的本质是混音。

In Mark Ronson's TED Talk on [How Sampling Transformed Music](https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_ronson_how_sampling_transformed_music/transcript?language=en), he says:  

在 Mark Ronson 关于采样如何改变音乐的 TED 演讲中，他说：

One of the most revolutionary aspects of TikTok is how effortless it makes it to sample or interpolate any other TikTok video.  

TikTok 最具革命性的方面之一是它可以轻松地采样或插入任何其他 TikTok 视频。

Anyone who's used a non-linear editor like Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, or Avid Media Composer knows the standard multi-pane interface.  

任何使用过 Adobe Premiere、Final Cut Pro 或 Avid Media Composer 等非线性编辑器的人都知道标准的多窗格界面。  

And any editor knows that editing begins with importing all the media, the shots from dailies, the temp music, and so on, into your media bin.  

任何编辑都知道，编辑首先是将所有媒体、样片中的镜头、临时音乐等导入到媒体箱中。  

From there, you drag elements onto the timeline to compose the edit.  

从那里，您将元素拖到时间线上以进行编辑。

Much of the pain of creating memes is gathering all the components, like images, from the web.  

创建模因的大部分痛苦在于从网络上收集所有组件，例如图像。  

In the modern networked age, though, the media bin should really just be the entirety of the internet. Anything you want should just be a short search away.  

然而，在现代网络时代，媒体箱实际上应该是整个互联网。您想要的任何东西都只需短暂搜索即可获得。  

We're starting to get closer, though the library of material is still sparse, and many pieces, especially video, still require chasing down.  

我们已经开始接近这个目标，尽管资料库仍然稀疏，而且许多作品，尤其是视频，仍然需要追寻。

Someday, any sort of remix will just be a GPT-3 like interface away from composing.  

总有一天，任何类型的混音都将只是一个类似于 GPT-3 的界面，远离作曲。  

You'll just be able to write "This is Fine cartoon but the dog's face is Donald Trump" and it will just spit it out for you.  

你只需写“这是精美的卡通片，但狗的脸是唐纳德·特朗普”，它就会为你吐出来。  

If you're building this, please let me know, I'll write you a seed check.  

如果你正在构建这个，请告诉我，我会给你写一张种子支票。

The Verge [interviewed](https://www.theverge.com/21504619/ricky-desktop-tiktok-beat-creator-interview-musician-viral-hits) a TikTok beatmaker named Ricky Desktop.

The woah inspired Ricky Desktop to develop a score for the triple woah which then actually inspired dancers to choreograph and perform an actual triple woah.  

哇哦的灵感启发了 Ricky Desktop 为三重哇哇创作了一首乐谱，这实际上启发了舞者编排并表演了一个真正的三重哇哦。

Can you program human movement with music? It turns out you can. You use an API called TikTok. That's delightful.  

你能用音乐来编程人类的动作吗？事实证明你可以。您使用名为 TikTok 的 API。那真是令人愉快。

[TikTok beatmaker Ricky Desktop](https://www.theverge.com/21504619/ricky-desktop-tiktok-beat-creator-interview-musician-viral-hits) pictured, in his head, dancers performing some movement. Then he wrote a piece of music that included a musical cue intended to elicit that exact movement.  

TikTok 节拍制作人 Ricky Desktop 在他的脑海中描绘了舞者在表演一些动作。然后他写了一首音乐，其中包含旨在引发确切动作的音乐提示。

Then, later, some dancers on TikTok performed the movement he had pictured, exactly at the moment he had inserted the musical prompt.  

随后，TikTok 上的一些舞者在他插入音乐提示的同时表演了他所描绘的动作。  

It's not just that he choreographed the human body via music, but how he did it. Ricky Desktop is a marionettist manipulating human bodies not via strings but music.  

这不仅仅是他通过音乐来编排人体，而是他是如何做到的。 Ricky Desktop 是一位木偶师，他不是通过弦乐而是通过音乐来操纵人体。

In filmmaking, when you want a score for your film, you bring the latest cut of your film to a composer's studio, and they start riffing based on what they see on screen, incorporating some of the themes you're trying to evoke in that scene.  

在电影制作中，当你想要为你的电影配乐时，你把电影的最新剪辑带到作曲家的工作室，他们开始根据他们在屏幕上看到的内容即兴演奏，融入你试图在其中唤起的一些主题场景。

What Ricky Desktop talks about above is a different process in which he scores to visuals that only exist in his imagination, generic dance tropes like "pretend to play the flute".  

Ricky Desktop 上面谈到的是一个不同的过程，在这个过程中，他对只存在于他想象中的视觉效果进行评分，比如“假装吹笛子”之类的通用舞蹈比喻。

This is a form of "inverted scoring." Or, if you prefer to go from the other direction, what TikTok dancers do with sounds is "visualizing."  

这是“反向评分”的一种形式。或者，如果你更喜欢从另一个方向走，TikTok 舞者对声音所做的就是“可视化”。

The program WinAmp used to do software visualizations of music. TikTok is like Mechanical Turk for visualizing music.  

WinAmp 程序用于对音乐进行软件可视化。 TikTok 就像将音乐可视化的 Mechanical Turk。

If you've watched any amount of TikTok, you've doubtless seen someone answering questions by dancing and pointing to floating text overlays.  

如果您看过一定数量的 TikTok，您无疑会看到有人通过跳舞和指向浮动文本覆盖来回答问题。

Now, they could easily just speak the questions and answer them verbally. There's no reason to have to dance to music while answering the questions.  

现在，他们可以轻松地说出问题并口头回答。没有理由在回答问题时必须随着音乐跳舞。

To which I say, no one knows what it means, but it's provocative, it gets the people going!  

我想说的是，没有人知道这意味着什么，但它具有挑衅性，它让人们前进！

This is one of many TikTok survey or poll formats, all devised by the users. On one hand, there are simpler ways to share this information.  

这是 TikTok 众多调查或民意调查格式之一，全部由用户设计。一方面，有更简单的方法来共享此信息。  

On the other hand, this is much more entertaining than a Twitter poll.  

另一方面，这比 Twitter 民意调查有趣得多。

On the other hand, maybe all this choreographed dancing is something more of us should be doing to make our messages land.  

另一方面，也许所有这些精心设计的舞蹈是我们更多人应该做的事情，以使我们的信息落地。  

A teacher went viral on TikTok this year for filming herself trying to teach her class remotely over Zoom.  

今年，一名老师因拍摄自己试图通过 Zoom 远程授课的视频而在 TikTok 上疯传。  

Seeing her precise and broad gestures paired with her sharply articulated speech, you couldn't help but feel empathy for what a burden we've placed on our teachers, trying to make remote classes engaging over Zoom.  

看到她精确而广泛的手势，再加上她清晰的演讲，你不禁会同情我们给老师带来的负担，因为我们试图通过 Zoom 使远程课程变得有吸引力。

But perhaps we just lose some of our childlike exuberance and joy expressiveness as we age?  

但也许随着年龄的增长，我们只是失去了一些童趣和快乐的表现力？  

Perhaps if we were more animated in our delivery, more people would remember what we said.  

也许如果我们的表达更加生动，更多的人会记住我们所说的话。

One of the most common weaknesses among managers and leaders is the [illusion of transparency](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Illusion_of_transparency), though it is a problem for most people. It is the tendency to overestimate how much people know what you're thinking.  

管理者和领导者最常见的弱点之一是对透明度的错觉，尽管这对大多数人来说都是一个问题。人们倾向于高估人们对你的想法的了解程度。  

It can ruin marriages or relationships, and it leads to a healthy market for therapy.  

它可能会毁掉婚姻或人际关系，但却会带来健康的治疗市场。

Young children have the a strong form of this illusion which is why in early childhood they are so frustrated when you don't understand why they're upset (and parents are likewise just as exasperated that their children can't verbalize why they're freaking out).  

年幼的孩子有这种幻觉的强烈形式，这就是为什么在童年早期，当你不明白他们为什么不高兴时，他们会如此沮丧（父母同样会因为孩子无法用语言表达他们为什么不高兴而感到愤怒）吓坏了）。  

Until later in life, children think you should know exactly what they're feeling, and it takes a bit of coaxing to tease out their inner emotional state.  

直到长大后，孩子们才会认为你应该确切地知道他们的感受，需要一些哄骗才能弄清楚他们内心的情绪状态。  

Ironically, despite their illusion of transparency, kids tend to be much more emotionally transparent and thus expressive.  

具有讽刺意味的是，尽管孩子们对透明度抱有幻想，但他们在情感上往往更加透明，因此更善于表达。

It's when they finally realize that no one can see into their heads that they learn to lie. It's then that you wish they still had the illusion of transparency.  

当他们最终意识到没有人能看透他们的头脑时，他们就学会了撒谎。那时你会希望他们仍然有透明度的幻觉。  

When they become teenagers, the battle over transparency into their lives becomes literal: parents yell at their teenagers to keep their bedroom doors open, and those same doors slam shut after heated arguments.  

当他们成为青少年时，关于生活透明度的斗争变得真实：父母对青少年大喊大叫，让他们保持卧室的门打开，而同样的门在激烈的争吵后又关上了。  

Their bedrooms become, like their thoughts, spaces they wish to protect from prying eyes.  

他们的卧室就像他们的思想一样，成为他们希望保护不被窥探的空间。

This is all a roundabout way to say that a CEO communicating a company's top goal for the coming year in a TikTok dance, pointing to on-screen captions, isn't the worst idea in the world?  

这是一种迂回的说法，首席执行官在 TikTok 舞蹈中指着屏幕上的字幕传达公司来年的最高目标，这不是世界上最糟糕的主意吗？  

Maybe this is the new Amazon 6-page memo.  

也许这就是亚马逊新推出的 6 页备忘录。

Study any high-level memory competitor and they'll all say the same thing. Humans' visual memories are far superior to their memories for abstractions.  

研究任何高水平的内存竞争对手，他们都会说同样的话。人类的视觉记忆远远优于抽象记忆。  

It's one of the core lessons from the great book [Moonwalking with Einstein](https://amzn.to/3rIfnzh).  

这是《与爱因斯坦一起月球漫步》这本伟大著作的核心课程之一。  

It's the reason people who have to try to memorize a thousand digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards turn numbers and letters into images which they place spatially in memory palaces.  

这就是为什么人们必须尝试记住圆周率的一千位数字或一副纸牌的顺序，才能将数字和字母转化为图像，并将其空间放置在记忆宫殿中。

In its heyday, which coincided with my childhood, MTV was dominated by music videos, and each of those was essentially a visualization of a musical track.  

在 MTV 的鼎盛时期，也就是我的童年时期，MTV 以音乐视频为主，每部视频本质上都是音乐曲目的可视化。  

To this day, I can't hear a song like A-Ha's "Take on Me" without picturing [its music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914). I haven't seen it in decades, but its cartoon sketches come to life are forever how I "see" the song.  

直到今天，每当我听到像 A-Ha 的《Take on Me》这样的歌曲时，都会想起它的音乐视频。我已经几十年没看过这首歌了，但它栩栩如生的卡通草图永远是我“看到”这首歌的方式。  

Likewise, I can't hear Michael Jackson's Thriller without conjuring its epic music video of nearly 14 minutes.  

同样，每当我听到迈克尔·杰克逊的《Thriller》时，我都会想起它长达近 14 分钟的史诗般的音乐录影带。

It doesn't even have to be a music video. A song incorporated in a film can permanently bond with the moving images on the screen.  

它甚至不必是音乐视频。电影中融入的歌曲可以与银幕上的移动图像永久地结合在一起。  

For example, I can't hear three tracks, one each by Huey Lewis, Genesis, and Whitney Houston, respectively, without picturing Christian Bale and quoting Patrick Bateman, and then being filled with a sense of self-loathing for having been indicted as someone who turns to the appreciation of cultural artifacts as a substitute for personality.  

例如，当我听到休伊·刘易斯 (Huey Lewis)、创世纪 (Genesis) 和惠特尼·休斯顿 (Whitney Houston) 的三首歌时，如果不想象克里斯蒂安·贝尔 (Christian Bale) 并引用帕特里克·贝特曼 (Patrick Bateman)，然后因为被指控为转向对文化艺术品的欣赏来代替个性的人。  

If I mention Celine Dion's song "My Heart Will Go On," what do you see in your mind's eye?  

如果我提到席琳迪翁的歌曲“My Heart Will Go On”，您会想到什么？

TikTok is the modern MTV because (1) it increases consumption of music tracks that go viral on its platform as sounds and (2) any number of songs will forever summon the accompanying meme and visual choreography from my memory.  

TikTok 是现代 MTV，因为（1）它增加了对在其平台上以声音形式病毒式传播的音乐曲目的消费，（2）任何数量的歌曲都会永远从我的记忆中唤起伴随的模因和视觉编排。

When Charli and other TikTokers formed the Hype House in Los Angeles, they were experimenting with IRL creative network effects.  

当 Charli 和其他 TikTok 用户在洛杉矶成立 Hype House 时，他们正在试验现实生活中的创意网络效应。  

They created what was efffectively a commune to produce the D'Amelio TikTok Universe with Charli at the center as, I don't know, Tony Stark or something.  

他们创建了一个有效的公社，以产生达梅里奥 TikTok 宇宙，以查理为中心，我不知道，托尼·斯塔克什么的。

They started guest-starring in each other's TikTok's, some of them started dating and hooking up, and soon, to follow the entire extended narrative, you had to follow each other's accounts.  

他们开始在彼此的 TikTok 中客串，其中一些人开始约会和勾搭，很快，为了跟踪整个扩展的叙述，你必须关注彼此的帐户。  

Studios have tried to push out fictional versions of such networked series, but Charli et al just created it bottoms up, with TikTok as the distributor.  

工作室曾试图推出此类网络连续剧的虚构版本，但 Charli 等人只是自下而上地创建了它，并以 TikTok 作为发行商。

The Kardashian-Jenner clan are the clear predecessors who ran this type of crossover mindshare grab, but they're family.  

卡戴珊-詹纳家族显然是进行这种跨界思想占有率争夺的前辈，但他们是一家人。  

This new generation of influencers often aren't related, their common bond is just that they're young and famous in the age of social media and so they already all live together in a virtual universe held together by the gravity of popularity.  

这些新一代的影响者通常没有血缘关系，他们的共同点就是他们在社交媒体时代年轻且出名，因此他们已经生活在一个由人气引力聚集在一起的虚拟宇宙中。

In [Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service), I wrote about how social networks require some proof of work to gain status.  

在“状态即服务”中，我写了有关社交网络如何需要一些工作证明才能获得状态的文章。

A lot of TikTok's have the caption "I spent way too long on this" as a sort of plea for likes, but that wouldn't land if the proof of work wasn't visible on the screen.  

很多 TikTok 的标题都是“我在这上面花了太长时间”，作为一种求赞的方式，但如果屏幕上看不到工作证明，那么标题就不会落地。  

It is, and even non-creators can see it. Some TikToks seem like they took days to produce.  

确实如此，甚至非创作者也能看到。有些 TikTok 似乎花了几天时间才制作出来。

Have you tried using the in-app TikTok video editor? In some ways, it's loaded with really first-rate filters and effects, but in many ways, its user interface is inscrutable.  

您是否尝试过使用应用内的 TikTok 视频编辑器？在某些方面，它装载了真正一流的滤镜和效果，但在很多方面，它的用户界面是难以理解的。  

I went to editing school and have used a variety of non-linear editors (NLEs) like FCP, Premiere, and Avid to edit video in a previous life, and I still tear my hair out trying to use TikTok's native editor.  

我上过剪辑学校，以前用过 FCP、Premiere 和 Avid 等各种非线性编辑器 (NLE) 来编辑视频，现在我仍然在努力尝试使用 TikTok 的原生编辑器。

The easiest videos to make are just ones where you film yourself live and apply a filter, but if you want to bring in pre-recorded video and mix them with other graphical elements, like text boxes, it is very painful to assemble them properly.  

最简单的视频制作就是您现场拍摄自己并应用滤镜的视频，但如果您想引入预先录制的视频并将其与其他图形元素（例如文本框）混合，则将它们正确组合起来非常痛苦。  

My kingdom for a persistent timeline with a scrubber in the TikTok editor.  

我的王国是 TikTok 编辑器中带有洗涤器的持久时间线。

In one sense, it's staggering to ponder how many more videos TikTok would have if its video editor were more usable.  

从某种意义上说，如果 TikTok 的视频编辑器更实用的话，它还会拥有多少视频，这令人震惊。  

On the other hand, every video that does make it onto the app feels like a miracle. The proof of work is in the pain.  

另一方面，每个进入应用程序的视频都感觉像是一个奇迹。工作量证明正处于痛苦之中。

If you're a movie star like Will Smith and you get a VFX studio to produce some whiz-bang TikTok for you, it will feel off, like driving a Ferrari down the street in Omaha.  

如果你是像威尔·史密斯这样的电影明星，并且有一家视觉特效工作室为你制作一些精彩的 TikTok，你会感觉很舒服，就像在奥马哈的街道上驾驶法拉利一样。  

Authenticity or at least the sheen of one's own sweat equity is part of the TikTok aesthetic, and the canonical backdrop for any TikTok video is always some teenager's somewhat messy bedroom, just as it was in the heyday of the YouTube vlog.  

真实性或者至少是自己汗水资产的光泽是 TikTok 审美的一部分，任何 TikTok 视频的典型背景总是某个青少年有点凌乱的卧室，就像 YouTube 视频博客的鼎盛时期一样。

On Instagram, you can get away with proof of wealth, but the TikTok aesthetic is proof of creative labor. The verdict is a bit more mixed on proof of hotness, though.  

在 Instagram 上，你可以逃避财富的证明，但 TikTok 的审美是创造性劳动的证明。不过，对于热度的证明，结论有点复杂。  

I still think Instagram is a more welcoming home for pure thirst trap content than TikTok, where, if you want to honeytrap the simps, you're going to have to dance for it.  

我仍然认为 Instagram 比 TikTok 更适合纯粹的口渴陷阱内容，在 TikTok 上，如果你想诱骗傻瓜，你就必须为之跳舞。

Something about a feed that can hit you with such a variety of styles and moods in such quick succession makes TikTok feel like the most modern of media channels.  

一个信息流可以如此迅速地连续地以如此多种风格和情绪打动你，这让 TikTok 感觉像是最现代的媒体渠道。  

One second you're watching a [dog communicate with their owner using a language mat](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexgurley/bunny-the-talking-dog-from-tiktok), the next second some high school girl is roasting one of her classmates, the next you see a teen making an earnest confessional deprecating their own looks (only to have thousands of commenters offering affirmation), and then you might see a boat chase that you later realize is some drug cartel member filming a TikTok as police boats give chase ([even Narcos be chasing them likes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/world/americas/mexico-drugs-cartel-tiktok.html)). At times it feels as if the FYP feed is a pastiche generator.  

前一秒你还看到一只狗用语言垫与主人交流，下一秒某个高中女生正在烤她的一个同学，下一秒你就看到一个青少年真诚地忏悔自己的外表（结果却有成千上万的人）的评论者提供肯定），然后你可能会看到一场小船追逐，后来你意识到这是一些贩毒集团成员在警船追赶时拍摄 TikTok（甚至毒枭也在追赶他们）。有时，五年计划的提要感觉就像是一个仿制品生成器。

It is equal parts ironic and earnest, having long since surpassed its label as the cringey social network.  

它既讽刺又真诚，早已超越了其“令人尴尬的社交网络”的标签。

Whereas Instagram is performative, TikTok is performative and self-aware.  

Instagram 具有表演性，而 TikTok 则具有表演性和自我意识。  

It’s not that any single creator is self-aware, but that the Greek chorus in the comments will descend on anyone with the slightest bit of hubris like a pack of harpies.  

并不是说任何一个创作者都有自我意识，而是评论中的希腊合唱会像一群鹰身女妖一样降临到任何有一点傲慢的人身上。

In this rectangular proscenium that is TikTok, the fickle god of Zeus is played, of course, by the FYP algorithm.  

在TikTok这个长方形的舞台上，善变的宙斯之神当然是由FYP算法扮演的。  

Everyone offers up their sacrifices of time and labor in the hopes of being graced by its favor, but its whims remain just capricious enough to keep everyone grinding.  

每个人都牺牲自己的时间和劳动，希望得到它的青睐，但它的反复无常仍然足以让每个人都苦苦挣扎。

If your FYP feed is dialed in to your tastes, you start to pre-react to videos purely based on the like count visible on the right hand side of the screen.  

如果您的 FYP feed 符合您的口味，您就会开始纯粹根据屏幕右侧可见的点赞数对视频做出预先反应。

If a video has a high like count, even if it starts slowly I'll tend to give it the benefit of the doubt and stick around to the end, simply because this statistic has proved, in my experience, reliable evidence of a worthwhile payoff.  

如果一个视频的点赞数很高，即使它开始很慢，我也会倾向于相信它并坚持到最后，因为根据我的经验，这个统计数据已经证明了值得回报的可靠证据。  

The larger the figure, the more I anticipate a strong punchline or close. I'm like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, already having seen the precog verdict printed on that ball.  

数字越大，我就越期待一个强有力的妙语或结尾。我就像《少数派报告》中的汤姆·克鲁斯一样，已经看到了印在那个球上的预知判决。

Conversely, when I'm the test audience for a little-seen video (a dead giveaway is it has almost no likes yet), I tend to be merciless in skipping ahead if it doesn't hold my attention after a few seconds.  

相反，当我是一个鲜为人知的视频的测试观众时（一个致命的泄露是它几乎还没有喜欢），如果它在几秒钟后没有引起我的注意，我往往会毫不留情地跳过。

This creates a ruthless rich-get-richer dynamic, but that's by design.  

这创造了一种无情的富者愈富的动态，但这是设计使然的。  

Bytedance as a company has built its products around pitiless algorithms enforcing a high Gini coefficient economy of entertainment.  

字节跳动作为一家公司，围绕无情的算法打造其产品，强制执行高基尼系数的娱乐经济。  

It's a marketplace in which the supply side—the TikTok videos from creators—can be shown to an unlimited number of viewers.  

在这个市场中，供应方（来自创作者的 TikTok 视频）可以向无限数量的观众展示。  

Much of the content is evergreen, so there is almost no end to the leverage TikTok can get off any single good video.  

大部分内容都是常青的，因此 TikTok 从任何一个优秀视频中获得的杠杆作用几乎是无穷无尽的。

Imagine if YouTube's key metric was to show every good video in its entire catalog to every viewer that would enjoy it.  

想象一下，如果 YouTube 的关键指标是向每个喜欢它的观众展示其整个目录中的每一个精彩视频。  

If you view the TikTok mission that way, even if no one submitted another new video for the next year, its FYP algorithm would still have an almost infinite supply of short videos to show to hundreds of millions of users for that entire dry spell.  

如果你这样看待 TikTok 的使命，即使没有人在明年提交另一个新视频，其 FYP 算法仍然会在整个干旱期向数亿用户展示几乎无限的短视频。

Because sounds become the genesis of particular memes, when you start watching a TikTok video and hear a familiar sound, you anticipate the moment of that sound when the punchline will happen.  

因为声音成为特定模因的起源，所以当你开始观看 TikTok 视频并听到熟悉的声音时，你会预料到该声音出现时的笑点。  

It's Pavlovian. 这是巴甫洛夫式的。

The [kismet shoe transition](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kismet-shoe-transitions), for example, causes you to anticipate the pleasure of that exact moment when the performer will go from looking plain to looking EXPENSIVE.  

例如，Kismet 鞋的转变会让你期待表演者从看起来朴素到看起来昂贵的那一刻的乐趣。  

There are only so many plots in Hollywood, but we go see genre films precisely for the story beats we know are coming.  

好莱坞的情节只有这么多，但我们去看类型电影正是为了我们知道即将到来的故事节奏。

On TikTok, sounds and memes are almost inseparable. The sound is the meme is the sound.  

在 TikTok 上，声音和表情包几乎密不可分。声音就是模因就是声音。

TikTok sounds are often the most pleasing snippets from pop songs, and listening to one catchy loop after another is like listening to a pop radio channel that doesn't play entire songs, only plays bass drops and choruses.  

TikTok 的声音通常是流行歌曲中最令人愉悦的片段，听一首又一首朗朗上口的循环就像听一个流行广播频道，它不会播放整首歌曲，只播放低音和合唱。  

The time between anticipation and payoff is so short that scrolling the feed can feel like pressing the button on some sonic IV drip over and over. Just inject it into my ears.  

预期和回报之间的时间是如此之短，以至于滚动提要感觉就像一遍又一遍地按下某些声波 IV 滴注器上的按钮。只要把它注射到我的耳朵里就可以了。

In [Infinite Jest](https://amzn.to/3jQiOjX), David Foster Wallace describes a film called Infinite Jest which is so entertaining people lose all will to do anything except watch it until they die.  

在《无尽的玩笑》中，大卫·福斯特·华莱士描述了一部名为《无限的玩笑》的电影，这部电影非常有趣，让人失去了做任何事情的意愿，除了观看它直到死去。  

He had often written about the addictiveness of television and may have been extrapolating to the future, projecting the entertainment value of entertainment increasing until it surpassed some threshold where you'd lose all will to do anything except consume.  

他经常写到电视的成瘾性，并且可能会推断未来，预测娱乐的娱乐价值会不断增加，直到它超过某个阈值，在这个阈值中，你会失去除了消费之外做任何事情的意愿。  

In that way, he predicted binge watching.  

通过这种方式，他预测了观看的狂欢。

But the earliest form of entertainment that conjured the addictive properties of his fictional film (referred to in the novel as "the Entertainment") was video games.  

但最早使他的虚构电影令人上瘾的娱乐形式（在小说中称为“娱乐”）是电子游戏。  

I read stories about players who died after playing games for so long without eating and, recalling some game binge sessions from my youth, could imagine myself trapped in a similar dark loop.  

我读到过一些玩家在长时间不吃东西玩游戏后死亡的故事，回想起我年轻时的一些游戏狂欢，可以想象自己陷入了类似的黑暗循环。

TikTok is the second form of entertainment that brings DFW's fictional entertainment to mind.  

TikTok 是第二种让人想起 DFW 虚构娱乐的娱乐形式。  

In hindsight, it seems obvious that a personalized feed of video, tailored to your tastes, would be the addictive end state of entertainment.  

事后看来，很明显，根据您的口味量身定制的个性化视频源将是令人上瘾的娱乐最终状态。  

And, considering the rise of social media and the smartphone, it would make sense that the videos might all be short, like pellets of rain, sliding comfortably into every spare pocket of time in our day, of which we have so many.  

而且，考虑到社交媒体和智能手机的兴起，视频可能都很短，就像雨滴一样，舒适地滑入我们一天中的每一个空闲时间，这是有道理的，我们有这么多的空闲时间。

[One of my favorite paragraphs of recent years](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html) was one describing the miracle that are Cheetos:  

近年来我最喜欢的段落之一是描述奇多奇迹的一段：

> To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, “Why Humans Like Junk Food.” I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste.  
> 
> 为了更好地了解他们的工作，我拜访了食品科学家史蒂文·威瑟利（Steven Witherly），他为业内人士撰写了一本引人入胜的指南，题为“为什么人类喜欢垃圾食品”。我给他带来了两个购物袋，里面装满了各种薯片供他品尝。  
> 
> He zeroed right in on the Cheetos.  
> 
> 他把注意力集中在奇多上。  
> 
> “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more.  
> 
> “就纯粹的快乐而言，”威瑟利说，“这是地球上构造最奇妙的食物之一。”他列举了奇多的十几个属性，这些属性可以让大脑表达更多信息。  
> 
> But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said.  
> 
> 但他最关注的是泡芙神奇的入口即化能力。 “这被称为热量密度消失，”威瑟利说。  
> 
> “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.”  
> 
> “如果某物很快融化，你的大脑就会认为其中没有卡路里。 。 。你可以一直吃下去。”

TikTok is entertainment Cheetos.  

TikTok 是娱乐奇多。  

Each video requires so little cognitive exertion and reaches its climax so quickly that it feels like we could keep watching forever, each punch line scored to the most satisfying bass drop or stanza from every pop song.  

每个视频只需要很少的认知努力，而且很快就达到高潮，感觉我们可以一直看下去，每个妙语都是每首流行歌曲中最令人满意的低音或节。  

TikTok delivers dopamine hits with a metronomic rhythm, and as soon as we swipe up the previous one melts in our memory.  

TikTok 以节拍的节奏传递多巴胺，当我们向上滑动时，上一个就会融化在我们的记忆中。

It's always been the case, but especially in this networked age, that every piece of entertainment is its own social network.  

情况一直如此，但尤其是在这个网络时代，每项娱乐都是它自己的社交网络。  

The network effects of a story arise from shared consumption.  

故事的网络效应源于共享消费。  

The more people watch Star Wars, the more people I can talk to about particular scenes or compare costumes with at a convention.  

观看《星球大战》的人越多，我就能在大会上与更多的人谈论特定场景或比较服装。  

The more people that watch Game of Thrones, the more my Game of Thrones memes will land.  

观看《权力的游戏》的人越多，我的《权力的游戏》表情包就会越多。

TikTok is personalized, yet through its algorithm it creates shared stories of real scale.  

TikTok 是个性化的，但通过其算法，它创造了真实规模的共享故事。  

Some of these shared stories occur on the creative side in duets and trims that connect creators to each other literally and metaphorically.  

其中一些共享的故事发生在创意方面，以二重唱和修饰的方式将创作者彼此联系起来。  

The FYP algorithm also aggregates large communities of viewers for the hottest TikTok videos.  

FYP 算法还聚合了最热门 TikTok 视频的大量观看者社区。  

It's not uncommon now for me to send a TikTok to a friend who's already seen it, or vice versa.  

现在，我将 TikTok 发送给已经看过它的朋友，或者反之亦然，这并不罕见。  

Not always, but enough that the audience now assumes enough common knowledge to foster that sense of shared experience.  

并不总是如此，但足以让观众现在假设有足够的常识来培养这种共享经验的感觉。

Despite having what must be a gazillion videos in its catalog, watch TikTok enough and you'll be able to refer to something like Sea Shanty TikTok and feel reasonably confident other TikTok addicts get the reference.  

尽管其目录中肯定有无数的视频，但只要足够多地观看 TikTok，您就可以参考 Sea Shanty TikTok 之类的内容，并且有相当的信心其他 TikTok 成瘾者会得到参考。  

In contrast, people regularly send me YouTube videos with like millions of views that I've never even heard of.  

相比之下，人们经常向我发送观看次数高达数百万次的 YouTube 视频，而我却从未听说过。

It is algorithms that may be tearing us apart. But maybe it's also algorithms that reassemble us, albeit in smaller unit sizes.  

可能是算法让我们分崩离析。但也许算法也可以重新组装我们，尽管单位尺寸较小。  

330M Americans feel like too large an optimal governance size if we're going to let social media algorithms just run amok, but I find some comfort sometimes when I find some TikTok that feels so catered to my tastes that it must be a micro-niche and then see it has millions of likes.  

如果我们要让社交媒体算法胡作非为，3.3 亿美国人会觉得最佳治理规模太大了，但有时当我发现一些 TikTok 非常迎合我的口味，它一定是一个微型利基市场时，我会感到一些安慰。然后看到它有数百万个赞。

The term binge-watching typically refers to watching multiple episodes of a series in one sitting, but perhaps the act of watching dozens of TikTok videos in a row is the purest form of this type of entertainment gluttony.  

“狂看”一词通常指的是一次观看一个系列剧的多集，但连续观看数十个 TikTok 视频的行为也许是这种娱乐暴食的最纯粹形式。

Other types of social media like Instagram and Twitter are also series of really compact units of media.  

Instagram 和 Twitter 等其他类型的社交媒体也是一系列非常紧凑的媒体单元。  

When I scroll Twitter or Instagram, I often feel like an elephant, standing there placidly, as various people toss individual packing peanuts at my forehead (let’s call these people the peanut gallery?).  

当我浏览 Twitter 或 Instagram 时，我常常感觉自己像一头大象，平静地站在那里，看着不同的人把单独包装的花生扔到我的额头上（让我们称这些人为花生画廊？）。

TikTok videos are, for the most part, a bit longer. Their compressed narratives are still, nevertheless, complete, with some full story arc to traverse.  

TikTok 视频大部分都比较长。尽管如此，他们压缩的叙述仍然是完整的，有一些完整的故事情节可供穿越。  

In its rhythm, binge-watching TikTok reminds me of watching a standup comedy set, but instead of watching one comedian, I’m watching a whole series of them, each on stage just long enough to tell one joke.  

狂看 TikTok 的节奏让我想起观看单口喜剧，但我不是在看一个喜剧演员，而是在看一整套喜剧，每一个在舞台上的时间只够讲一个笑话。  

And if they bore me, I can press a button and, like a Looney Tunes cartoon, a cane whisks them off the stage and a new comedian pops out from the floor to take their place and start right into their joke.  

如果他们让我感到厌烦，我可以按下一个按钮，就像乐一通的卡通片一样，一根手杖将他们从舞台上拉下来，然后一个新的喜剧演员从地板上跳出来取代他们的位置，然后开始他们的笑话。

Someone told me that if you watch TikTok for over an hour it posts a warning asking you to consider taking a break.  

有人告诉我，如果你观看 TikTok 超过一个小时，它会发出警告，要求你考虑休息一下。  

I'm not sure if that's the case, but I'm glad I've never encountered it yet.  

我不确定是否是这样，但我很高兴我还没有遇到过。

TikTok can only match you with videos it has, and for some people, there may not be enough relevant content in the TikTok catalog to sustain a feed.  

TikTok 只能将您与它拥有的视频进行匹配，对于某些人来说，TikTok 目录中可能没有足够的相关内容来维持提要。  

But that pool of videos has grown by an astonishing amount in a short amount of time.  

但视频池在短时间内就增长了惊人的数量。

I'm an easy mark for the sort of wry, sometimes savage humor of TikTok, especially when it skews almost post-modern in its awareness of its own form.  

我很容易被 TikTok 那种讽刺、有时甚至是野蛮的幽默所吸引，尤其是当它对自身形式的认识几乎是后现代的时候。  

It's both a community that constantly tries to legislate its own social norms of decency—any video of someone making fun of how they look using a supposed beauty filter will be flooded with comments like "You're a queen", the comments section being sort of a rolling floor vote on what the acceptable response is—and also a bloodbath of Gen Z violence.  

这也是一个不断试图制定自己的社会正派规范的社区——任何有人用所谓的美容滤镜取笑自己外表的视频都会充斥着诸如“你是女王”之类的评论，评论部分一场关于可接受的反应的滚动投票，也是 Z 世代暴力的大屠杀。  

The kids will be alright, but that's in part because they're savage. Every generation learns it has to fend for itself.  

孩子们会没事的，但这部分是因为他们很野蛮。每一代人都知道自己必须自力更生。

During a pandemic when most of social media feels even more nakedly performative than usual, as we sit inside day after day for month after month, my occasional sessions on TikTok have been one of the only pastimes to reliably make me laugh, and it's not particularly close.  

在大流行期间，大多数社交媒体感觉比平时更加赤裸裸的表演，当我们日复一日、月复一月地坐在室内时，我偶尔在 TikTok 上的会话是唯一可靠地让我发笑的消遣之一，而且这并不是特别重要。关闭。

Twitter has reached a crest of fortune cookie thinkboi bait when it's not subsumed in petty high school lunchroom culture war fistfights.  

当 Twitter 不被卷入高中餐厅文化战争的小打斗中时，它就已经达到了幸运饼干 Thinkboi 诱饵的顶峰。  

Seemingly every day, a playground brawl breaks out and we all form a circle to gawk, but at the back of our minds is always the threat that we'll be the next to be sucker-punched and forced to throw down.  

似乎每天都会发生操场上的争吵，我们都围成一圈呆呆地看着，但我们的脑海深处始终威胁着我们将成为下一个被打倒并被迫摔倒的人。  

Outrage porn is exhausting and also not that fun?  

愤怒的色情片让人筋疲力尽，而且也不那么有趣？

When viewed from the eye of a global pandemic, Instagram feels like a horrifying Truman Show of idyllic capitalist showboating.  

从全球大流行的角度来看，Instagram 感觉就像一场田园诗般的资本主义炫耀的可怕杜鲁门秀。  

Life must go on, influencers gotta influence, but I'm also not weeping any tears when people get chastised for renting private islands and posting photos of themselves partying during a pandemic.  

生活必须继续，有影响力的人必须发挥影响力，但当人们因在大流行期间租用私人岛屿并发布自己聚会的照片而受到惩罚时，我也不会流任何眼泪。

Andrew Niccol, the screenwriter of The Truman Show, once said, "When you know there is a camera, there is no reality.” The most absurd but popular tag on visual social media is #nofilter, a hashtag that aspires to a pretense of truth when there is almost nothing on an app like Instagram that isn’t production-designed within an inch of its life.  

《杜鲁门的世界》的编剧安德鲁·尼科尔曾经说过：“当你知道有摄像机时，现实就不存在了。”视觉社交媒体上最荒谬但最流行的标签是#nofilter，当像 Instagram 这样的应用程序上几乎没有任何东西不是在其生命周期中设计的时候，这个标签渴望假装真实。

TikTok, by virtue of its high bar to even produce a video that anyone will see (FYP algo is like "That's a no for me dawg" on almost every video), is upfront about what it is: a global talent show to entertain the masses.  

TikTok 凭借其高标准，甚至可以制作任何人都会看到的视频（FYP 算法就像几乎每个视频中的“这对我来说不行”），它很坦率地说明了它的含义：一个全球性的选秀节目，旨在娱乐群众。  

In a pandemic where much of the U.S. lives in eternal lockdown, TikTok is the 24/7 channel where the American Idle entertain each other from their bedrooms. I laughed, and then I laughed some more.  

在美国大部分地区处于永久封锁状态的大流行中，TikTok 是美国闲人在卧室里互相娱乐的 24/7 频道。我笑了，然后我又笑了。

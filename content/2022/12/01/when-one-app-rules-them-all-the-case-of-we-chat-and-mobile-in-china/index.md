This post is all about WeChat, but it’s also about more than just WeChat. While seemingly just a messaging app, WeChat is actually more of a portal, a platform, and even a mobile operating system depending on how you look at it.

这篇文章是关于微信的，但也不仅仅是微信。 虽然看似只是一个消息应用程序，但微信实际上更像是一个门户、一个平台，甚至是一个移动操作系统，这取决于你如何看待它。

Much has been written about WeChat in the context of messaging app trends, but few outside of China really understand _how_ it works — and how it can pull off what for many companies (and countries) is still a far-off vision of a world managed entirely through our smartphones. Many of WeChat’s most interesting features — such as access to [city services](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/24/why-wechat-city-services-is-a-game-changing-move-for-smartphone-adoption/) — are not even visible to users outside China. So why should people outside of China even care about WeChat? The first and most obvious reason is that it [points](http://recode.net/2015/05/19/western-messaging-apps-are-looking-to-chinas-wechat-for-inspiration/) to where Facebook and other messaging apps [could head](https://pando.com/2012/07/13/asia-may-once-again-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-social-networks/). Second, WeChat [indicates](http://recode.net/2015/06/18/messaging-apps-and-platforms-of-convenience/) where the future of mobile [commerce](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/never-leave/) may lie. Third, WeChat shows what it’s like to be both a [platform](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/19/facebook-messenger-platform/) _and_ a mobile portal (what Yahoo [could have](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/8/1/app-unbundling-search-and-discovery) been).

在消息应用趋势的背景下，关于微信的文章很多，但在中国以外很少有人真正了解 _它是如何_ 运作的——以及它如何实现对许多公司（和国家）来说仍然是一个遥远的世界管理愿景完全通过我们的智能手机。 微信的许多最有趣的功能——例如访问 [城市服务](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/24/why-wechat-city-services-is-a-game-changing-move-for-smartphone-adoption/) ——甚至对中国以外的用户都看不到。 那么为什么中国以外的人还要关心微信呢？ 第一个也是最明显的原因是它 [指出](http://recode.net/2015/05/19/western-messaging-apps-are-looking-to-chinas-wechat-for-inspiration/) 了 Facebook 和其他消息应用程序 [的](https://pando.com/2012/07/13/asia-may-once-again-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-social-networks/) 发展方向。 其次，微信 [预示](http://recode.net/2015/06/18/messaging-apps-and-platforms-of-convenience/) 的未来 [着移动商务](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/never-leave/) 可能在哪里。 第三，微信展示了它既是一个 [平台](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/19/facebook-messenger-platform/) _又_ 是一个移动门户（雅虎本 [可以](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/8/1/app-unbundling-search-and-discovery) 成为）的感觉。

Ultimately, however, WeChat should matter to all of us because it shows what’s possible when an entire country — which currently has a smartphone penetration of [62%](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/13/gsma-idUSnBw125058a+100+BSW20150713) (that’s almost 1/3 of its population) — “leapfrogs” over the PC era directly to mobile. WeChat was not a product that started as a website and then was adapted for mobile, it was (to paraphrase a certain [movie](https://youtu.be/F157geaXp_w)) _born into it, molded by it_.

然而，归根结底，微信对我们所有人都应该很重要，因为它展示了当整个国家——目前智能手机普及率达到 [62%](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/13/gsma-idUSnBw125058a+100+BSW20150713) （几乎占其人口的 1/3）——“跨越”PC 时代直接进入移动的。 微信不是一个从网站开始然后适应移动端的产品，它是（套用某部 [电影](https://youtu.be/F157geaXp_w) ） _生于其中，由它塑造的_ 。

Most notable, however, for anyone in the tech business is WeChat’s average revenue per user or ARPU, which is estimated to be at least [$7 USD](http://qz.com/179007/wechat-is-nothing-like-whatsapp-and-that-makes-it-even-more-valuable/) — that’s _7X_ the ARPU of WhatsApp, the [largest](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/04/17/whatsapp-hits-800000-users-1-billion-by-year-end/) messaging platform in the world. How did WeChat do it?

然而，对于科技行业的任何人来说，最值得注意的是微信的每用户平均收入或 ARPU，估计至少 [为 7 美元](http://qz.com/179007/wechat-is-nothing-like-whatsapp-and-that-makes-it-even-more-valuable/) ——是 _的7 倍_ WhatsApp ARPU [世界上最大](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/04/17/whatsapp-hits-800000-users-1-billion-by-year-end/) 的消息平台 。 微信是怎么做到的？

## **But first, some background: What is WeChat?**

## **但首先，了解一些背景知识：什么是微信？**

Known in Chinese as Weixin (微信) — “micro letter” — [WeChat](https://vimeo.com/123624442) is first and foremost a messaging app for sending text, voice, and photos to friends and family. It was launched just 4 years ago by Chinese investment holding company Tencent, one of the largest internet companies in the world. As of earlier this year, WeChat had [549 million](https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-549-million-active-users-q1-2015/) monthly active users (MAUs) among over one billion registered users, almost all of them in Asia. To put that in context: That’s only 150M MAUs fewer than [Facebook Messenger](https://pando.com/2015/07/31/facebook-messenger-cheapest-quickest-way-zuckerberg-has-ever-acquired-700-million-users/), almost 3x the MAUs of Japan’s [Line](https://www.techinasia.com/line-reports-2014-revenues-of-656m-reaches-181m-monthly-active-users/), and 10x the MAUs of Korea’s [Kakao](http://www.wsj.com/articles/mobile-chat-service-kakaotalk-faces-growing-pains-1424885119) (which Tencent is also an investor in). \[Tencent is also a strategic investor in a number of U.S. startups, including some of ours.\]

在中文中被称为微信（微信）——“微信”—— [微](https://vimeo.com/123624442) 信首先是一个消息应用程序，用于向朋友和家人发送文本、语音和照片。 它是 4 年前由中国投资控股公司腾讯推出的，腾讯是世界上最大的互联网公司之一。 截至今年早些时候，微信在超过 10 亿注册用户中拥有 [5.49 亿](https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-549-million-active-users-q1-2015/) 月活跃用户 (MAU)，几乎所有用户都在亚洲。 换句话说：这仅比 [Facebook Messenger](https://pando.com/2015/07/31/facebook-messenger-cheapest-quickest-way-zuckerberg-has-ever-acquired-700-million-users/) 少 1.5 亿 MAU ，几乎是日本 [Line](https://www.techinasia.com/line-reports-2014-revenues-of-656m-reaches-181m-monthly-active-users/) 的 MAU 的 3倍，是韩国 [Kakao](http://www.wsj.com/articles/mobile-chat-service-kakaotalk-faces-growing-pains-1424885119) （腾讯也是其投资方）的 MAU 的 10 倍。 \[腾讯还是多家美国初创公司的战略投资者，其中包括我们的一些公司。\]

Downloading the app is free, and WeChat has only just begun to experiment with [advertising](https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-moments-adverts-test/) revenue, so where then does its ARPU magic lie? (Especially when one remembers the difficulty of monetizing other universal, utilitarian services like email.) The short answer is that it offers more _functionality_. Along with its basic communication features, WeChat users in China can access services to hail a taxi, order food delivery, buy movie tickets, play casual games, check in for a flight, send money to friends, access fitness tracker data, book a doctor appointment, get banking statements, pay the water bill, find geo-targeted coupons, recognize music, search for a book at the local library, meet strangers around you, follow celebrity news, read magazine articles, and even donate to charity … all in a single, integrated app.

收入才刚刚开始尝试 [下载应用是免费的，微信的广告](https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-moments-adverts-test/) ，那么它的ARPU魔力在哪里呢？ （尤其是当人们还记得将电子邮件等其他通用、实用的服务货币化的困难时。）简短的回答是它提供了更多的 _功能_ 。 除了基本的通讯功能外，中国的微信用户还可以使用微信叫出租车、订外卖、买电影票、玩休闲游戏、办理登机手续、给朋友汇款、访问健身追踪器数据、预约医生等服务约会、获取银行对账单、支付水费、查找地理定位优惠券、识别音乐、在当地图书馆查找书籍、结识周围的陌生人、关注名人新闻、阅读杂志文章，甚至向慈善机构捐款……全都在一个单一的集成应用程序。

In WeChat’s case, chat — not other content streams or a search box — is the “universal” [UI](http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html#chatasui). (And while this post is not focusing on design, it is worth noting that Chinese apps tend to combine as many features as possible into one application. This is in stark contrast to Western apps, which lean towards “[app constellations](http://avc.com/2014/05/app-constellations/)”.)

## **How WeChat works #1: The app-within-an-app model — changes everything we think we know about ‘web vs. mobile’**

Philosophically, while Facebook and WhatsApp measure growth by the number of daily and monthly active users on their networks, WeChat cares more about how relevant and central WeChat is in addressing the daily, even hourly needs of its users. Instead of focusing on building the largest social network in the world, WeChat has focused on building a _mobile lifestyle_ — its goal is to address every aspect of its users’ lives, including non-social ones.

The way it achieves this goal is through one of the most unsurfaced aspects of WeChat: the pioneering model of “apps within an app”. Millions (note, not just thousands) of lightweight apps live inside WeChat, much like webpages live on the internet.

This makes WeChat more like a browser for mobile websites, or, arguably, a mobile operating system — complete with its own proprietary app store. Not what we’d expect from a messaging app.

The lightweight apps on WeChat are called “official accounts”. Approved by WeChat after a brief application process, there are well over [10 million](http://mt.sohu.com/20150804/n418139020.shtml) of these official accounts on the platform — ranging from celebrities, banks, media outlets, and fashion brands to hospitals, drug stores, car manufacturers, internet startups, personal blogs, and more. It’s important to emphasize that these official accounts are nothing like verified accounts on U.S. social networks, where being “official” is mainly a badge of authenticity or identity verification. On WeChat, official accounts are approved to access exclusive APIs for payments, location, direct messages, voice messages, user IDs, and more. (Not every official account uses these APIs, but there are still millions of them that indeed are app-like.)

For the end-user, adding an official account is as simple as adding a friend. Furthermore, because users have to opt-in to official accounts, they are essentially always “logged in” to them. This is especially effective for lower frequency but important services like managing credit card statements or utility bills. Such apps are perfectly suited to the lightweight app model, because users are spared the trouble of downloading separate native full-featured apps (yet can still choose to do so if the preview of what the app does seems compelling enough). It’s a win-win either way.

Developing official WeChat accounts has become so popular in China that new startups sometimes test their version 1.0 product on WeChat’s platform _before_ dedicating resources to building and marketing a standalone native app. Another benefit for developers is getting core app functionality without having to support multiple mobile OSes. Developers are also not forced to stay within the look-and-feel of the WeChat client, i.e., they aren’t constrained to some subset of HTML5. So when a user interacts with an official account, the user can click to a full web application experience without ever leaving WeChat. This empowers developers to deliver distinctive, custom app-like experiences while WeChat enforces the rules (messaging frequency, sensor permissions, etc.) that protect users.

These web-enabled, app-within-an-app official accounts are a breakthrough in messaging, and are one of many reasons that WeChat has become a flourishing platform for any company or influencer that wants a mobile presence in China.

That portal takes the form of the WeChat “Wallet”, which is not a traditional wallet but a menu of carefully curated, pre-selected service providers that users can transact with after inputting their payment credentials.

I cannot emphasize the importance of this Wallet enough. It’s the Trojan horse that allows WeChat to quickly onboard user payment credentials that then unlock new monetization opportunities for the _entire_ ecosystem. (Which is why it’s very revealing that Facebook [hired](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/on-david-marcus-and-facebook/) the former CEO of Paypal to head up its own messaging platform efforts.)

To get a sense of how pervasive and successful this approach has been: At _least_ [one in five](http://www.shanghaidaily.com/business/it/Over-100m-users-pay-through-Tencents-WeChat-and-QQ/shdaily.shtml) active WeChat users are set up for WeChat “Payments”, a process that begins in the Wallet menu by linking a banking or credit card to the user account. Being set up for WeChat Payments means instant, frictionless ability to transact on the WeChat Wallet services, all official accounts that sell products or services, and any associated promotions or campaigns.

To get a sense of this in the U.S.: Just imagine how many more transactions would occur on Facebook’s platform if more users linked their credit cards to [Messenger](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/technology/facebook-announces-a-payments-feature-for-its-messenger-app.html), how much faster Pinterest’s [buy-it button](https://about.pinterest.com/en/buy-it) would take off, how much faster Snapchat users would move from [sending cash](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/17/snapchat-debuts-way-to-send-cash-to-friends-in-a-snap/) to buying goods, and how many more Twitter users would pursue [options to buy](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/testing-new-ways-to-make-it-easier-to-discover-products-and-places) products. In this sense, WeChat gives us a window into the potential evolution of Western social networks and buying behaviors if they, too, succeed in convincing users to embrace payments on their platforms.

In China, meanwhile, usage of the WeChat Payments platform is growing so quickly that WeChat is experimenting with processing payments offline via QR codes at brick-and-mortar stores, live events, vending machines, restaurants, and hotels. The network effects are obvious and substantial: The more places that accept these payments, the more users will jump on board (and it goes both ways, both offline and online) … benefitting everyone all round.

So what makes the wallet model work? The WeChat Wallet menu has several portal-like characteristics: as mentioned earlier, it has 1) built-in trust since designated partners have been vetted and selected by Tencent, as well as 2) automatic authentication of identity and payment, and 3) the ability to offer seamless experiences with third parties while never requiring the user to leave the WeChat app. For example, I’ve often heard people say they use “WeChat to hail a taxi,” when in fact ride-sharing service Dididache is actually providing that transportation service. Similarly, here’s an example of making a doctor appointment using WeChat, which appears seamlessly integrated within the app even though it is powered by third-party reservation service Jiuyi160.com:

_These 5 screenshots, viewed left to right, show the flow of booking a doctor appointment via WeChat Wallet_

Note that to implement this direct doctor appointment feature, WeChat did not have to go sell some enterprise solution to hospitals in what would otherwise have been a long process (“[like passing a bill through Congress](https://a16z.com/2014/05/30/selling-saas-products-dont-sell-themselves/)”). Instead, WeChat focuses on taking care of the plumbing — overseeing the integration of such pre-existing services into its portal — by simply linking users from the wallet menu to webpages from within the app. It’s yet another way in which WeChat becomes an integrated browser for the mobile (and web) world.

Widespread adoption of WeChat Payments didn’t happen overnight; it was seeded through lots of proactive promotion. For example, earlier this year, Tencent launched a Chinese New Year [campaign](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidyin/2015/02/19/tencents-wechat-sends-1-billion-virtual-red-envelopes-on-new-years-eve/) where third party advertisers gave away 500M RMB (~$81M USD) of free cash in red envelopes to WeChat Payment users in a single day. Prior to that, WeChat and ride-sharing service Dididache incented users to sign up for payments by [offering](https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-didi-dache-100000-taxi-rides-chinese-passengers/) free ride giveaways and discounts for hailing a taxi via WeChat.

WeChat has also been busy creating [tools](http://walkthechat.com/weidian-released-amazing-data-about-wechat-e-commerce-in-china/) so that official accounts can open e-commerce stores that accept WeChat Payments — essentially making every business, including mom-and-pop shops without advanced tech or e-commerce resources, an instant mobile store.

Beyond these promotions and resources, Tencent _architected_, and in some cases, _subsidized_ the payments system in WeChat’s early days. The resulting user adoption and portal model has given Tencent a kind of “kingmaking power” for Chinese apps (and by association, internet startups in China) because partner companies selected to be part of the WeChat Wallet portal get instant exposure to hundreds of millions of users.

Having access to that kind of distribution is very hard for any partner company to turn down, despite the platform risk. But this is where aligned financial interests help protect some startups from the downsides of WeChat platform dependence: Most of the companies highlighted in the WeChat Wallet portal have taken investment dollars from Tencent, or were launched by them. This might explain why other Chinese internet giants with similar distribution power (Alibaba, Baidu, Qihoo360, and Xiaomi) have all been doubling down on early stage investments and going head-to-head with China’s top VC firms. Imagine what would happen if that trend [moved to the U.S.](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/15/the-kingmaker-strategy-pioneered-by-the-chinese-internet-giants-coming-to-america/), and if Facebook or Snapchat ever decided to strike favorable deals through early stage investing.

## How WeChat works #4: When mobile doesn’t just navigate, but moves _into_ the physical world

When people talk about mobile, they often throw concepts like “context-aware”, “sensor-enabled”, “personalized”, “interactive”, and other terms around. But in the U.S., these concepts remain either buzzwords or solo features in individual apps. We just don’t see the level of integration and frictionless mobile-first experiences we see in places like China through WeChat.

To put it bluntly: It’s like killing a buffalo and only using its skin for leather, as opposed to also using its meat, its milk, and more. In much the same way, most mobile experiences in the U.S. remain at a superficial, surface-only level … without really harnessing _all_ the parts of the phone, from GPS location to sensors to voice to camera.

So where most U.S. apps confine the smartphone camera to just taking photos of people and places, WeChat engages the camera to scan English text and translate it into Chinese, or to pay directly for a transaction. WeChat also better utilizes all the other smartphone sensors as sources of data input: It uses GPS when users search for businesses nearby. It calls upon the microphone to identify a TV show or a song on the radio. It uses the accelerometer when a user shakes a device to find strangers nearby to chat with. And it uses bluetooth when users add friends in their vicinity.

Put it all together, and you can get some pretty creative results. Take Chinese toy company Dan Dan Man, which created [Mon-Mon](http://v.qq.com/page/s/r/i/s0153j3wwri.html) (user ID: idandanman), a bluetooth-enabled stuffed animal toy that integrates WeChat with the offline world. Parents can use the Mon-Mon official account in WeChat to send personal voice messages and pre-recorded English courses or bedtime stories to the toy while they are at work or traveling. Kids immediately get those stories or messages, and can even press Mon-Mon’s belly to reply to their parents’ WeChat account in a message delivered back as a voicemail.

Of course, there are many other, more useful examples of such online-offline integrations. With the 7-Eleven official account (user ID: GD7-11) for example, users can pay at 7-Eleven and Family Mart physical stores through a breezy, easy payment process where the cashier uses a standard handheld barcode scanner to get the customer’s Quick Pay barcode at the point of sale. 7-Eleven can then also target users with custom promotions at an optimal frequency that doesn’t flood them with unwanted marketing. Meanwhile, the Mei Wei Bu Yong Deng official account (user ID: mwbyd-now) lets users search through a directory of restaurants nearby, see how many people are currently waiting in line for a table at those restaurants, and even grab a number to wait in line without being physically present at the restaurant.

And finally, it’s worth noting that WeChat is, according to Tim Cook on Apple’s most recent earnings call, [one of the top](http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/21/fy15-q3-earnings-call/) 3rd-party apps used on the Apple Watch. The possibilities for online-offline integration through wearables haven’t really begun to be explored yet.

## How WeChat works #5: Where social is just a feature, not the focus — liberating brands and celebrities in new ways

## How WeChat works #5: Where social is just a feature, not the focus — liberating brands and celebrities in new ways

At the time WeChat was first created (2011), a Chinese Twitter-like service for 140-character posts called Sina Weibo already existed and had hundreds of millions of users. Celebrities, influencers, brands, and companies had official Weibo accounts and used them to broadcast public messages to millions of followers. For WeChat to make its official accounts platform work, then, it had to move beyond the framework and limitations of a social network — where content is king — to a system that prioritized usefulness and functionality above everything else.

For WeChat to make its official accounts platform work, then, it had to move beyond the framework and limitations of a social network — where content is king — to a system that prioritized usefulness and functionality above everything else.

This focus on function over social has significant consequences for brands. Where brands must rely on static, one-size-fits all blasts in U.S. social networks — and users are confined to only liking, favoriting, commenting on, or sharing posts — WeChat shows us what’s possible when brands are offered more options for interacting with their users. For example, where Starbucks could post an offer for all users on its Facebook page, on WeChat, it could theoretically also allow a user to inquire after their gift card balance, place a favorite drink order, find the nearest store without having to specify intent, or receive a promotion tailored to drink preferences based on the weather in that city. Where a celebrity like Taylor Swift can share 140 characters about her upcoming concert on Twitter, on WeChat, she could send a concert discount code to users who purchased her album, or charge users a small fee for daily pre-recorded morning greetings (some celebrities in Asia actually already do this!).

None of this functionality is that surprising on its own; we already expect this kind of thing inside a standalone Starbucks or Taylor Swift app. The point here is that brands are able to do this sort of personalization and interactivity from _within_ WeChat, through official accounts. And because WeChat official accounts are not limited to the content-constrained construct of a social network, they can deliver experiences that are more personalized, interactive, and ultimately have a higher chance of converting to a transaction.

WeChat also gives official account developers the ability to precisely target and segment users so they can deliver the right set of messages to the right set of users at the right time and place. Importantly, these CRM and marketing automation tools are completely free. While other social networks may also offer granular user targeting, those targeting capabilities apply only to purchasing ads. In WeChat’s case, brands can freely use these tools in all their interactions with users as they like.

Interestingly, because the official accounts platform also allows for “white listing” of users, WeChat official accounts empower both large companies _and_ small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to create easy-to-develop enterprise-grade solutions. By tiering access and permissions to ensure that these official accounts are not accessible to all WeChat users, developers can create reference training materials, document sharing tools, business request approval workflow processes, content management systems, frontline sales interfaces, and more. Even kindergarten schools become tech-savvy with such tools:

_These screenshots of Chengdu 21st Kindergarten’s official account show how parents (whose WeChat IDs are whitelisted) can see real-time updates about their child while in school \[left\] or a photo of who picked up the child from school that day \[right\]_

In this way, WeChat can penetrate the enterprise much faster than competing or previous social networks. (Not unlike Slack, which is in some ways like a “white listed” chat room that has become a portal to so many other enterprise applications.)

WeChat reveals what’s possible when we take a mobile-first approach to platforms, portals, social networks, and brands. The question isn’t about how to replicate the same model elsewhere, or about why it wouldn’t (or would) work in the United States. The question we should ask, I believe, is how can every business rethink its model from the ground up, so it leads and not lags behind mobile?

It’s worth sharing that before WeChat launched in 2011, the most popular messaging app in China was called QQ — and it was also made by Tencent. QQ started on the desktop and made its way onto feature phones in 2003 and smartphones in 2008. But when Tencent realized how game-changing the smartphone really was, they decided to tackle the problem with a blank slate rather than have the QQ team try to create a better smartphone app. So WeChat was created by an entirely new group of Tencent employees who were challenged to design a mobile messaging service without the legacy of PC. The result is what I’ve outlined here, and it still only scratches the surface. Who knows what’s coming next?

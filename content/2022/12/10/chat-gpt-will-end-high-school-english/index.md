Teenagers have always found ways around doing the hard work of actual learning. CliffsNotes date back to the 1950s, “No Fear Shakespeare” puts the playwright into modern English, YouTube offers literary analysis and historical explication from numerous amateurs and professionals, and so on. For as long as those shortcuts have existed, however, one big part of education has remained inescapable: writing. Barring outright plagiarism, students have always arrived at that moment when they’re on their own with a blank page, staring down a blinking cursor, the essay waiting to be written.

青少年总能找到方法来完成实际学习的艰苦工作。 CliffsNotes 的历史可以追溯到 1950 年代，“No Fear Shakespeare”将剧作家变成现代英语，YouTube 提供来自众多业余爱好者和专业人士的文学分析和历史解释等等。 然而，只要这些捷径存在，教育的一大部分就仍然不可避免：写作。 除非完全剽窃，否则学生总是会在他们自己拿着空白页，盯着闪烁的光标，等待写作的那一刻到达。

Now that might be about to change. The arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a program that generates sophisticated text in response to any prompt you can imagine, may signal the end of writing assignments altogether—and maybe even the end of writing as a gatekeeper, a metric for intelligence, a teachable skill.

现在这种情况可能即将改变。 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 是一个程序，它可以根据你能想象到的任何提示生成复杂的文本，它的出现可能标志着写作任务的结束——甚至可能标志着作为看门人写作的结束，这是一种智力指标，一种可传授的技能。

If you’re looking for historical analogues, this would be like the printing press, the steam drill, and the light bulb having a baby, and that baby having access to the entire corpus of human knowledge and understanding. My life—and the lives of thousands of other teachers and professors, tutors and administrators—is about to drastically change.

如果你正在寻找历史类比，这就像印刷机、蒸汽钻机和电灯泡有了一个婴儿，而那个婴儿可以接触到人类知识和理解的整个语料库。 我的生活——以及其他数以千计的教师、教授、导师和管理人员的生活——即将发生翻天覆地的变化。

I teach a variety of humanities classes (literature, philosophy, religion, history) at a small independent high school in the San Francisco Bay Area. My classes tend to have about 15 students, their ages ranging from 16 to 18. This semester I am lucky enough to be teaching writers like James Baldwin, Gloria Anzaldúa, Herman Melville, Mohsin Hamid, Virginia Held. I recognize that it’s a privilege to have relatively small classes that can explore material like this at all. But at the end of the day, kids are always kids. I’m sure you will be absolutely shocked to hear that not all teenagers are, in fact, so interested in having their mind lit on fire by Anzaldúa’s radical ideas about transcending binaries, or Ishmael’s metaphysics in _Moby-Dick_.

我在旧金山湾区的一所小型独立高中教授各种人文课程（文学、哲学、宗教、历史）。 我的班级通常有大约 15 名学生，他们的年龄从 16 岁到 18 岁不等。这个学期我很幸运能够教授 James Baldwin、Gloria Anzaldúa、Herman Melville、Mohsin Hamid、Virginia Held 等作家。 我认识到拥有相对较小的班级可以探索这样的材料是一种荣幸。 但归根结底，孩子永远是孩子。 中的形而上学点燃他们的思想时如此感兴趣，我相信您一定会感到非常震惊 _我敢肯定，当听到并非所有青少年都对 Anzaldúa 关于超越双星的激进思想或 Ishmael 在Moby-Dick_ 。

To those students, I have always said: You may not be interested in poetry or civics, but no matter what you end up doing with your life, a basic competence in writing is an absolutely essential skill—whether it’s for college admissions, writing a cover letter when applying for a job, or just writing an email to your boss.

对那些学生，我总是说：你可能对诗歌或公民学不感兴趣，但无论你一生从事什么工作，写作的基本能力都是绝对必要的技能——无论是申请大学，写一篇申请工作时的求职信，或只是给老板写一封电子邮件。

[阅读：大学论文已死](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/)

I’ve also long held, for those who _are_ interested in writing, that you need to learn the basic rules of good writing before you can start breaking them—that, like Picasso, you have to learn how to reliably fulfill an audience’s expectations before you get to start putting eyeballs in people’s ears and things.

我也一直认为，对于那些 _对_ 写作感兴趣的人，你需要先学习好的写作的基本规则，然后才能开始打破它们——就像毕加索一样，你必须先学会如何可靠地满足观众的期望你开始把眼球放在人们的耳朵和东西上。

I don’t know if either of those things is true anymore. It’s no longer obvious to me that my teenagers actually will need to develop this basic skill, or if the logic still holds that the fundamentals are necessary for experimentation.

我不知道这两件事是否是真的。 对我来说，我的青少年实际上需要发展这项基本技能，或者如果逻辑仍然认为基础知识是实验所必需的，这对我来说已经不再明显了。

Let me be candid (with apologies to all of my current and former students): What GPT can produce right now is better than the large majority of writing seen by your average teacher or professor. Over the past few days, I’ve given it a number of different prompts. And even if the bot’s results don’t exactly give you goosebumps, they do a more-than-adequate job of fulfilling a task.

让我坦率地说（向我所有现在和以前的学生道歉）：GPT 现在可以产生的东西比你的普通老师或教授看到的大部分作品都要好。 在过去的几天里，我给了它很多不同的提示。 即使机器人的结果并不能完全让您起鸡皮疙瘩，它们也足以完成任务。

I mean, look at this: I asked the program to write me a playful, sophisticated, emotional 600-word college-admissions essay about how my experience volunteering at my local SPCA had prepared me for the academic rigor of Stanford. Here’s an excerpt from its response:

我的意思是，看看这个：我要求程序为我写一篇有趣、复杂、情绪化的 600 字大学入学论文，讲述我在当地 SPCA 做志愿者的经历如何让我为斯坦福大学的学术严谨做好准备。 以下是其回复的摘录：

> _In addition to cleaning, I also had the opportunity to interact with the animals. I was amazed at the transformation I saw in some of the pets who had been neglected or abused. With patience and care, they blossomed into playful and affectionate companions who were eager to give and receive love. I was also able to witness firsthand the process of selecting the right pet for the right family. Although it was bittersweet to see some animals leave the shelter, I knew that they were going to a loving home, and that was the best thing for them._
> 
> _除了打扫卫生，我还有机会与动物们进行互动。 我对在一些被忽视或虐待的宠物身上看到的转变感到惊讶。 在耐心和关怀下，他们成长为顽皮而深情的伙伴，渴望给予和接受爱。 我还能够亲眼目睹为合适的家庭选择合适的宠物的过程。 虽然看到一些动物离开收容所是喜忧参半，但我知道他们要去一个充满爱的家，这对他们来说是最好的事情。_

It also managed to compose a convincing 400-word “friendly” cover letter for an application to be a manager at Starbucks. But most jaw-dropping of all, on a personal level: It made quick work out of an assignment I’ve always considered absolutely “unhackable.” In January, my junior English students will begin writing an independent research paper, 12 to 18 pages, on two great literary works of their own choosing—a tradition at our school. Their goal is to place the texts in conversation with each other and find a thread that connects them. Some students will struggle to find any way to bring them together. We spend two months on the paper, putting it together piece by piece.

它还设法撰写了一封令人信服的 400 字的“友好”求职信，用于申请成为星巴克的经理。 但最令人瞠目结舌的是，在个人层面上：它让我快速完成了一项我一直认为绝对“牢不可破”的任务。 一月份，我的初级英语学生将开始撰写一篇 12 到 18 页的独立研究论文，内容涉及他们自己选择的两部伟大的文学作品——这是我们学校的传统。 他们的目标是让文本相互对话并找到连接它们的线索。 有些学生很难找到任何方法将他们聚集在一起。 我们花了两个月的时间在纸上，把它一块一块地拼凑起来。

I’ve fed GPT a handful of pairs that students have worked with in recent years: _Beloved_ and _Hamlet_, _The Handmaid’s Tale_ and _The Parable of the Sower_, Homer’s _The Odyssey_ and Dante’s _Inferno_. GPT brought them together instantly, effortlessly, uncannily: _memory, guilt, revenge, justice, the individual versus the collective, freedom of choice, societal oppression._ The technology doesn’t go much beyond the surface, nor does it successfully integrate quotations from the original texts, but the ideas presented were on-target—more than enough to get any student rolling without much legwork.

我为 GPT 提供了一些学生近年来使用过的对： _《宠儿_ 》和 _《哈姆雷特》_ 、 _《使女的故事》_ 和 _《播种者的寓言_ 》、荷马的 _《奥德赛》_ 和但丁的 _《地狱篇》_ 。 GPT 立即、毫不费力、不可思议地将它们聚集在一起： _记忆、内疚、报复、正义、个人与集体、选择自由、社会压迫。_ 该技术并没有超出表面，也没有成功地整合原文中的引文，但所提出的想法是切中要害的——足以让任何学生不费吹灰之力就上手。

It goes further. Last night, I received an essay draft from a student. I passed it along to OpenAI’s bots. “Can you fix this essay up and make it better?” Turns out, it could. It kept the student’s words intact but employed them more gracefully; it removed the clutter so the ideas were able to shine through. It was like magic.

它更进一步。 昨晚，我收到了一位学生的论文草稿。 我将它传递给 OpenAI 的机器人。 “你能修改这篇文章并让它变得更好吗？” 事实证明，它可以。 它完整地保留了学生的话，但更优雅地使用了它们； 它消除了混乱，使想法能够闪耀。 就像变魔术一样。

I’ve been teaching for about 12 years: first as a TA in grad school, then as an adjunct professor at various public and private universities, and finally in high school. From my experience, American high-school students can be roughly split into three categories. The bottom group is learning to master grammar rules, punctuation, basic comprehension, and legibility. The middle group mostly has that stuff down and is working on argument and organization—arranging sentences within paragraphs and paragraphs within an essay. Then there’s a third group that has the luxury of focusing on things such as tone, rhythm, variety, mellifluence.

我已经教了大约 12 年：首先在研究生院担任助教，然后在各种公立和私立大学担任兼职教授，最后在高中。 根据我的经验，美国的高中生大致可以分为三类。 底部组正在学习掌握语法规则、标点符号、基本理解力和易读性。 中间组主要负责这些内容，并致力于论证和组织——在文章的段落和段落中安排句子。 然后是第三组，他们可以专注于音调、节奏、多样性、流畅度等方面。

Whether someone is writing a five-paragraph essay or a 500-page book, these are the building blocks not only of good writing but of writing as a tool, as a means of efficiently and effectively communicating information. And because learning writing is an iterative process, students spend countless hours developing the skill in elementary school, middle school, high school, and then finally (as thousands of [underpaid adjuncts](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/adjunct-professors-higher-education-thea-hunter/586168/) teaching freshman comp will attest) college. Many students (as those same adjuncts will attest) remain in the bottom group, despite their teachers’ efforts; most of the rest find some uneasy equilibrium in the second category.

无论某人是在写一篇五段式的文章还是一本 500 页的书，这些不仅是良好写作的基石，也是将写作作为一种工具、作为一种高效和有效地交流信息的手段的基石。 因为学习写作是一个反复的过程，学生们在小学、初中、高中和最后（成千上万的低薪兼职教授大一新生将证明这一点）花费无数时间来培养写作 [技能](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/adjunct-professors-higher-education-thea-hunter/586168/) 。 尽管有老师的努力，许多学生（正如那些相同的辅助人员将证明的那样）仍然处于垫底。 其余的大多数人在第二类中找到了一些不稳定的平衡。

Working with these students makes up a large percentage of every English teacher’s job. It also supports a cottage industry of professional development, trademarked methods buried in acronyms ([ICE](https://www.abington.psu.edu/ice-introduce-cite-and-explain-your-evidence)! [PIE](https://bristolcc.edu/media/pie_format.pdf)! [EDIT](https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/83770/student/?section=1)! [MEAT](https://www.readingandwritinghaven.com/paragraph-acronyms-for-argumentative-writing)!), and private writing tutors charging $100-plus an hour. So for those observers who are saying, _Well, good, all of these things are overdue for change_—“this will lead to much-needed education reform,” a former colleague told me—this dismissal elides the heavy toll this sudden transformation is going to take on education, extending along its many tentacles (standardized testing, admissions, educational software, etc.).

与这些学生一起工作占每位英语教师工作的很大一部分。 它还支持专业发展的家庭手工业、埋藏在首字母缩略词中的商标方法（ [ICE](https://www.abington.psu.edu/ice-introduce-cite-and-explain-your-evidence) ！ [PIE](https://bristolcc.edu/media/pie_format.pdf) ！ [EDIT](https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/83770/student/?section=1) ！ [MEAT](https://www.readingandwritinghaven.com/paragraph-acronyms-for-argumentative-writing) ！），以及每小时收费 100 多美元的私人写作导师。 因此，对于那些说， _好吧，所有这些事情都应该改变的_ 观察家来说——“这将导致急需的教育改革，”一位前同事告诉我——这次解雇消除了这种突然转变所造成的沉重代价承担教育，沿着它的许多触角延伸（标准化测试、招生、教育软件等）。

Perhaps there are reasons for optimism, if you push all this aside. Maybe every student is now immediately launched into that third category: The rudiments of writing will be considered a given, and every student will have direct access to the finer aspects of the enterprise. Whatever is inimitable within them can be made conspicuous, freed from the troublesome mechanics of comma splices, subject-verb disagreement, and dangling modifiers.

如果您将所有这些放在一边，也许有乐观的理由。 也许每个学生现在都立即进入了第三类：写作的基础将被认为是给定的，每个学生都可以直接接触到企业的更精细方面。 它们中任何无法模仿的东西都可以变得引人注目，从逗号拼接、主谓不一致和悬空修饰语等麻烦的机制中解脱出来。

But again, the majority of students do not see writing as a worthwhile skill to cultivate—just like I, [sitting with my coffee and book](https://narrativenortheast.com/?p=3528), rereading _Moby-Dick_, do not consider it worthwhile to learn, say, video editing. They have no interest in exploring nuance in tone and rhythm; they will forever roll their eyes at me when I try to communicate the subtle difference, when writing an appositive phrase, between using commas, parentheses, or (the connoisseur’s choice) the em dash.

但同样，大多数学生并不认为写作是一项值得培养的技能——就像我一样， [坐在我的咖啡和书里](https://narrativenortheast.com/?p=3528) ，重读 _白鲸记_ ，不认为学习视频编辑是不值得的。 他们没有兴趣探索音调和节奏的细微差别； 当我试图传达细微差别时，他们将永远对我翻白眼，当我写一个同位语短语时，在使用逗号、括号或（鉴赏家的选择）破折号之间。

Which is why I wonder if this may be the end of using writing as a benchmark for aptitude and intelligence. After all, what is a cover letter? Its primary purpose isn’t to communicate “I already know how to do this job” (because of course I don’t) but rather “I am competent and trustworthy and can clearly express to you why I would be a good candidate for this job.” What is a written exam? Its primary signal isn’t “I memorized a bunch of information” but rather “I can express that information clearly in writing.” Many teachers have reacted to ChatGPT by imagining how to give writing assignments now—maybe they should be written out by hand, or given only in class—but that seems to me shortsighted. The question isn’t “How will we get around this?” but rather “Is this still worth doing?”

这就是为什么我想知道这是否可能是将写作作为能力和智力基准的终结。 毕竟，什么是求职信？ 它的主要目的不是传达“我已经知道如何做这份工作”（因为我当然不知道）而是“我有能力和值得信赖并且可以清楚地向你表达为什么我会成为这个工作的好人选”工作。” 什么是笔试？ 它的主要信号不是“我记住了一堆信息”，而是“我可以用书面形式清楚地表达这些信息”。 许多老师对 ChatGPT 的反应是想象现在如何布置写作作业——也许应该手写，或者只在课堂上布置——但在我看来，这是短视的。 问题不是“我们将如何解决这个问题？” 而是“这还值得做吗？”

I believe my most essential tasks, as a teacher, are helping my students think critically, disagree respectfully, argue carefully and flexibly, and understand their mind and the world around them. Unconventional, improvisatory, expressive, meta-cognitive writing can be an extraordinary vehicle for those things. But if most contemporary writing pedagogy is necessarily focused on helping students master the basics, what happens when a computer can do it for us? Is this moment more like the invention of the calculator, saving me from the tedium of long division, or more like the invention of the player piano, robbing us of what can be communicated only through human emotion?

我相信，作为一名教师，我最重要的任务是帮助我的学生批判性地思考、尊重不同意见、谨慎而灵活地争论，并理解他们的思想和周围的世界。 非常规的、即兴的、富有表现力的、元认知的写作可以成为这些东西的非凡载体。 但是，如果大多数当代写作教学法都必须专注于帮助学生掌握基础知识，那么当计算机可以为我们做这件事时会发生什么？ 这一刻更像是计算器的发明，将我从长除法的乏味中拯救出来，还是更像是演奏钢琴的发明，剥夺了我们只能通过人类情感交流的东西？

Maybe the moment when I felt most caught between these two thoughts was when I asked GPT a question from an exam I give in my Eastern-philosophy course, something I’ve never imagined a student could find outside assistance to answer: “Explain the Madhyamaka Buddhist idea that all phenomena lack inherent existence, using a funny, specific example.”

也许我最深陷于这两种想法之间的时刻是当我向 GPT 提出一个我在东方哲学课程中参加的考试中的问题时，这是我从未想过学生可以找到外部帮助来回答的问题：“解释 Madhyamaka佛教认为所有现象都缺乏固有的存在，用一个有趣的具体例子。

ChatGPT wrote back, as ever, instantly:

ChatGPT 一如既往地立即回信：

> _The Madhyamaka Buddhist idea that all phenomena lack inherent existence can be illustrated with a funny example: let’s say you have a pet hamster. You might think that your hamster has its own inherent existence, but in reality, your hamster is made up of many different elements such as its fur, its bones, its muscles, and its brain. None of these elements exist independently or inherently on their own, so your hamster itself does not have any inherent existence either. The same goes for all phenomena—everything is made up of various components that don’t have inherent existence, so nothing has any inherent existence either._
> 
> _可以用一个有趣的例子来说明所有现象都缺乏固有存在的中观佛教思想：假设你有一只宠物仓鼠。 您可能认为您的仓鼠有其固有的存在，但实际上，您的仓鼠是由许多不同的元素组成的，例如它的皮毛、它的骨骼、它的肌肉和它的大脑。 这些元素都不是独立或固有地独立存在的，所以你的仓鼠本身也不具有任何固有的存在。 一切现象也是如此，一切都是由各种成分组成的，这些成分没有固有的存在，所以也没有任何事物具有固有的存在。_

Everything is made up; it’s true. The essay as a literary form? Made up. Grammatical rules as markers of intelligence? Writing itself as a technology? Made up. Starting now, OpenAI is forcing us to ask foundational questions about whether any of those things are worth keeping around.

一切都是编造的； 这是真的。 散文作为一种文学形式？ 捏造。 语法规则作为智力的标志？ 把自己写成一门技术？ 捏造。 从现在开始，OpenAI 迫使我们提出一些基本问题，即这些东西是否值得保留。

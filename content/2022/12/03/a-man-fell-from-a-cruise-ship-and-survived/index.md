The Carnival Valor had been at sea for only a day when calls came over the loudspeaker asking a certain passenger to please report to customer service.

Carnival Valor 号出海仅一天，扩音器中就传来电话，要求某位乘客向客服报告。

The man, a 28-year-old American citizen, had been reported missing by his family that morning.

这名男子是一名 28 岁的美国公民，当天早上他的家人报告说他失踪了。

It was Thanksgiving, and the Valor, a [3,756-passenger cruise ship](https://carnival-news.com/ship/carnival-valor-fact-sheet/) that had left New Orleans the day before, was heading toward Cozumel, Mexico.

那是感恩节， [3,756 名乘客游轮Valor 正驶向墨西哥的科苏梅尔。](https://carnival-news.com/ship/carnival-valor-fact-sheet/) 前一天离开新奥尔良的

Crew members soon began searching passengers’ cabins, said Shant’a Miller White, who was traveling with her husband and family. One employee entered her cousin’s cabin and said, “We just need to make sure everything is OK.”

与丈夫和家人一起旅行的尚塔·米勒·怀特 (Shant'a Miller White) 说，机组人员很快就开始搜查客舱。 一名员工进入她堂兄的小屋说：“我们只需要确保一切正常。”

“We didn’t know what was going on,” Ms. White, 48, recalled. Then, at dinner, came another announcement: The ship needed to change course to execute a search and rescue operation.

“我们不知道发生了什么，”48 岁的怀特女士回忆道。 然后，在晚餐时，又传来了另一个通知：该船需要改变航向以执行搜救行动。

Ms. White pictured the unknown passenger alone in the water and felt sick to her stomach.

怀特女士想象着陌生乘客独自在水中的情景，感到胃部不适。

“Did they fall to the bottom? Did the sharks get them?” Ms. White recalled thinking. She began to pray.

“他们掉到谷底了吗？ 鲨鱼抓到了它们吗？” 怀特女士回忆当时的想法。 她开始祈祷。

The passenger, according to the Coast Guard, turned out to be James Grimes, 28, who had been traveling with his parents and siblings on the five-day cruise. His family had last seen him the night before, around 11 p.m.

据海岸警卫队称，这名乘客原来是 28 岁的詹姆斯·格莱姆斯 (James Grimes)，他与父母和兄弟姐妹一起参加了为期五天的游轮之旅。 他的家人最后一次见到他是在前一天晚上，大约晚上 11 点

But by 10:45 on Thanksgiving morning, when there was no sign of him, the family notified the crew, the Coast Guard said.

但海岸警卫队说，到感恩节早上 10 点 45 分，当没有他的踪迹时，他的家人通知了船员。

At 8:10 p.m., more than nine hours after his family reported him missing, a passing tanker spotted the man near the mouth of the Mississippi River and alerted the Coast Guard.

晚上 8 点 10 分，在他的家人报告他失踪九个多小时后，一艘路过的油轮在密西西比河河口附近发现了这名男子，并通知了海岸警卫队。

Rescuers found Mr. Grimes struggling in the water, waving frantically and trying to keep his head above the surface.

救援人员发现 Grimes 先生在水中挣扎，他疯狂地挥手并试图将头保持在水面以上。

When the crew of the MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter lifted him out, he was in shock, had mild hypothermia and was extremely dehydrated, said Lt. Seth Gross, who managed the search and rescue operation for the Coast Guard. But he was alive and in stable condition.

当 MH-60 Jayhawk 直升机的机组人员将他抬出来时，他处于休克状态，轻度体温过低并且极度脱水，负责海岸警卫队搜救行动的塞思格罗斯中尉说。 但他还活着，情况稳定。

Mr. Grimes, whose family described him as an exceptional swimmer, had treaded in 65- to 70-degree water for hours, withstanding rain, 20-knot winds and three- to five-foot waves in the Gulf of Mexico, where bull sharks and blacktip sharks are common, Coast Guard officials said.

Grimes 先生的家人称他是一位出色的游泳运动员，他曾在 65 到 70 度的水中行走数小时，经受住了墨西哥湾的雨水、20 节的风速和 3 到 5 英尺的海浪，牛鲨出没的地方海岸警卫队官员说，黑鳍鲨很常见。

“This case is certainly extraordinary,” Lieutenant Gross said. “The survival instinct, the will to survive is just crazy.”

“这个案子当然非同寻常，”格罗斯中尉说。 “生存本能，求生意志简直是疯了。”

## How often does this happen?

## 这种情况多久发生一次？

Falling from a ship into a vast sea may be a cruise passenger’s worst nightmare. While the chances of going overboard are exceedingly remote, according to [statistics from the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)](https://cruising.org/-/media/research-updates/report_operational_incidents_2019-v-1), the outcome is usually tragic.

从船上坠入浩瀚的大海可能是邮轮乘客最可怕的噩梦。 虽然落水的可能性 [根据邮轮国际协会 (CLIA) 的统计数据，](https://cruising.org/-/media/research-updates/report_operational_incidents_2019-v-1) 极小，但结果通常是悲惨的。

In 2019, 25 people fell overboard, and only nine of them were rescued, according to CLIA.

据 CLIA 称，2019 年有 25 人落水，其中只有 9 人获救。

In February, a woman aboard the Carnival Valor [jumped off the 10th deck of the ship](https://www.fox8live.com/2022/02/17/coast-guard-suspends-search-woman-who-jumped-cruise-ship/) while fleeing security officers who were trying to detain her after she had scuffled with them. Her body was never found.

2 月，Carnival Valor 号上的一名妇女在与 [时从船的第 10 层甲板跳下](https://www.fox8live.com/2022/02/17/coast-guard-suspends-search-woman-who-jumped-cruise-ship/) 安全人员发生扭打后逃离试图拘留她的安全人员 。 她的尸体从未被发现。

In December 2016, a 22-year-old man fell off the 12th deck of a Royal Caribbean cruise ship after a night of heavy drinking. His parents [sued the cruise line](https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/state/2018/12/18/royal-caribbean-found-not-responsible-for-overboard-death-of-man-served-equivalent-of-30-drinks/6612778007/) in federal court in Florida, but a jury decided in favor of Royal Caribbean.

2016 年 12 月，一名 22 岁的男子在喝了一夜酒后从皇家加勒比邮轮的第 12 层甲板上摔了下来。 他的父母 [在佛罗里达州的联邦法院起诉了邮轮公司](https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/state/2018/12/18/royal-caribbean-found-not-responsible-for-overboard-death-of-man-served-equivalent-of-30-drinks/6612778007/) ，但陪审团决定支持皇家加勒比。

Alcohol is a factor in at least 11 percent of falls from cruise ships, which often offer all-inclusive drink packages that encourage drinking onboard, said Ross Klein, a professor of social work at Memorial University of Newfoundland, who researches cruise safety.

研究邮轮安全的纽芬兰纪念大学社会工作教授罗斯克莱恩说，酒精是造成至少 11% 邮轮跌倒的一个因素，邮轮通常提供全包饮料套餐，鼓励在船上饮酒。

“Cruises are viewed as idyllic, safe and secure, and of course those views are reinforced by advertising and public statements,” he said. But the public should be aware of the risks of going on a cruise, which include being pushed overboard, going overboard and being tempted to jump overboard, he said.

“游轮被视为田园诗般的、安全可靠的，当然，广告和公开声明强化了这些观点，”他说。 但他说，公众应该意识到乘坐游轮的风险，包括被推下船、跳下船和被引诱跳下船。

## How do ships prevent people from going overboard?

## 船舶如何防止人们落水？

By law, railings have to be 42 inches tall, Professor Klein said. There were efforts to make the railings taller by about another foot, he said, after Congress began considering legislation to tighten security on ships in 2005. But in 2010, when Congress passed the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, the railing height requirements were set at the current standard, he said.

克莱因教授说，根据法律，栏杆必须有 42 英寸高。 他说，在国会于 2005 年开始考虑加强船舶安全的立法后，有人努力将栏杆加高约一英尺。但在 2010 年，国会通过了《邮轮安全与安全法》，规定了栏杆高度要求按照目前的标准，他说。

The railing height is designed to keep passengers safe along ship promenades, said Brian Salerno, the senior vice president for Maritime policy at CLIA.

CLIA 负责海事政策的高级副总裁 Brian Salerno 说，栏杆高度的设计是为了保证乘客在船舶长廊上的安全。

“The vast majority of cases are either reckless behavior or some form of intentional act,” Mr. Salerno said. “People don’t just inadvertently fall over the side of a ship.”

“绝大多数案件要么是鲁莽行为，要么是某种形式的故意行为，”萨勒诺先生说。 “人们不会不经意地从船舷上掉下来。”

Professor Klein said cruise ships could limit the risks of passengers falling overboard if they limited alcohol consumption, increased railing heights and installed technology that senses when a heavy object has fallen from the ship.

克莱恩教授说，如果游轮限制饮酒、增加栏杆高度并安装能够感知重物从船上掉落的技术，那么游轮就可以降低乘客落水的风险。

The 2010 law directed cruise ships to begin developing and installing such technology, Mr. Salerno said.

Salerno 先生说，2010 年的法律指示游轮开始开发和安装此类技术。

It took years to create a video-surveillance system that would be sensitive enough to detect a person falling overboard and alarm a ship’s crew but that wouldn’t be triggered by other objects, like a sea gull flying by, he said. Some ships have already begun installing such systems, Mr. Salerno said.

他说，创建一个视频监控系统需要数年时间，该系统足够灵敏，可以检测到落水人员并向船员发出警报，但不会被其他物体触发，例如飞过的海鸥。 Salerno 先生说，一些船只已经开始安装此类系统。

Bartenders on cruises are also trained to watch for excessive drinking, said Robert Kritzman, a partner at Clyde & Co., an international law firm in Miami, who advises cruise companies.

为游轮公司提供建议的迈阿密国际律师事务所 Clyde & Co. 的合伙人罗伯特·克里兹曼 (Robert Kritzman) 说，游轮上的调酒师也接受过注意过度饮酒的培训。

“The general policy is the same as anywhere else: Once somebody becomes excessively intoxicated, you stop serving,” he said.

“一般政策与其他任何地方都一样：一旦有人喝得酩酊大醉，你就停止服务，”他说。

Carnival Corp. said the “only way to go overboard is to purposefully climb up and over the safety barriers.”

嘉年华公司表示，“唯一的过火方法就是有目的地爬上并越过安全屏障。”

“Cruise ships have safety barriers in all public areas that are regulated by U.S. Coast Guard standards that prevent a guest from falling off,” the company said in a statement that thanked the Coast Guard and the mariner who found Mr. Grimes. “Guests should never ever climb up on the rails.”

“游轮在所有公共区域都有安全护栏，这些护栏符合美国海岸警卫队的标准，可以防止客人掉下来，”该公司在一份声明中表示，感谢海岸警卫队和发现格兰姆斯先生的水手。 “客人永远不应该爬上铁轨。”

A spokesman did not respond to follow up questions about the incident or Carnival’s safety protocols.

发言人没有回应有关事件或嘉年华安全规程的后续问题。

## What happens when the crew learns that a person has gone overboard?

## 当船员得知有人落水时会发生什么？

Cruise ships have clear protocols for what to do when a person goes overboard, Mr. Kritzman said.

克里兹曼先生说，游轮对于人员落水时的处理方式有明确的规定。

Once the crew members learn that a person has gone overboard, they immediately inform the Coast Guard, stop the ship and turn around to help find the missing passenger. Often, smaller, fast boats are deployed from the ship to search for the person, Mr. Kritzman said.

船员一旦得知有人落水，立即通知海岸警卫队，停船回头帮助寻找失踪乘客。 克里兹曼先生说，通常情况下，船上会部署更小的快艇来搜寻此人。

The circumstances around the recent fall from the Carnival Valor, including the precise time that Mr. Grimes went overboard, remain unknown. The Coast Guard said it was investigating the incident.

Carnival Valor 最近坠落的情况，包括 Grimes 先生落水的确切时间，仍然未知。 海岸警卫队表示正在调查这起事件。

Lieutenant Gross said that after the Coast Guard learned about the missing passenger, it launched a 45-foot patrol boat, a helicopter and a tracker plane to search for him. The Coast Guard set up a search area of more than 7,000 square nautical miles, roughly the size of Massachusetts, he said, and immediately alerted any mariners around the Gulf of Mexico to look for the man.

格罗斯中尉说，海岸警卫队得知失踪乘客的消息后，出动了一艘45英尺长的巡逻艇、一架直升机和一架追踪机对其进行搜寻。 他说，海岸警卫队设立了一个超过 7,000 平方海里的搜索区域，大约相当于马萨诸塞州的面积，并立即通知墨西哥湾附近的所有海员寻找该男子。

[The Crinis](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9598165), a bulk carrier, spotted Mr. Grimes about 20 miles south of Southwest Pass, a channel at the mouth of the Mississippi River.

[散货船Crinis](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9598165) 号在密西西比河河口的西南通道以南约 20 英里处发现了格兰姆斯先生。

Lt. Gross said he called the man’s mother and stepfather to tell them he had been found.

格罗斯中尉说，他打电话给该男子的母亲和继父，告诉他们他已经找到了。

When he told them their son was stable and being treated at a hospital in New Orleans, he heard them cheer and cry.

当他告诉他们他们的儿子情况稳定并在新奥尔良的一家医院接受治疗时，他听到他们欢呼和哭泣。

Ms. White, who lives in Hampton, Va., and [runs an anti-bullying organization](https://www.pabva.com/), said she was flooded with relief when the ship announced that Mr. Grimes had been found alive.

住在弗吉尼亚州汉普顿的怀特女士 [经营着一个反欺凌组织](https://www.pabva.com/) ，她说当船上宣布格兰姆斯先生还活着时，她如释重负。

“That was nothing but God that he survived,” she said.

“他能活下来，全靠上帝，”她说。
